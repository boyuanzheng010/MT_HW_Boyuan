resuming debate .
Mr. Speaker , I wish to table a petition from leasees of Indian Point subdivision on Adams Lake in my riding .
Mr. Speaker , to me it is absolutely elementary that when allegations have been brought to your attention that you have actually written to the police and reported them to the police , that after you have made your decision and taken action upon them , you do inform your colleagues who are responsible for the organizations touched by the allegations .
that is what the difficult part is , trying to get facts from the government .
for the clarification of the member opposite , I would like to explain it a little further .
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi
also involved was the member for Port Moody - Coquitlan , Sharon Hayes , who resigned her position as a member of the House yesterday .
in conclusion , trade and investment start at home .
anyone who has served in this position knows that it is our families and our partners who are the unsung heroes of Canada .
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) :
it is not just the issue of the debt that we are concerned about .
Mr. Speaker , if I understand it correctly , the issue brought to our attention by the hon. member is that the Minister of Industry of the last Parliament saw a document before it was tabled in the House .
this will create a further disincentive to the creation of jobs .
it is as if , in a family budget , one parent required the other to clothe the children , but cut his or her budget in half at the same time .
an hon. member mentioned some of the other governments which have adopted this kind of plan .
i think this is a goal of most of here in the House on both sides .
* * *
my people is being insulted whenever such remarks are made .
it is incumbent on someone to make sure that the people who are receiving their benefits will continue to do so , and at least to make sure that the amount of money left to go into the benefits of younger generations will give them the maximum bang for their buck .
and the very last paragraph :
don ' t flatter yourself .
does this amendment give Quebec unique powers in amending the Constitution ?
they decide when there will be an investigation .
the problem must be addressed , now or never .
i would also want to acknowledge the fact that the people from that region sent a number of opposition members , including eight from this caucus , to Ottawa to voice their concerns about what was not happening in that part of the world .
there was basically guerrilla theatre between the Mohawks , the English , the Americans and the French .
the second test is the rule of law .
now more than ever , we deem sovereignty to be necessary .
and we are in the back asking " Are we at united Canada ?
Mr. Speaker , when the health minister was recently asked where he would find the money for national pharmacare , he replied : " I don ' t know but it ' s a really good idea '' .
there is a public health emergency in Vancouver ' s downtown east side .
it was not .
* * *
i am proud to stand before the House on behalf of the people of Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac and on behalf of seasonal workers .
where is the fairness in taking from one generation without its consent to subsidize benefits for another generation ?
Mr. Jack Ramsay
increases in tuition fees are the result of cuts to provincial transfer payments for post - secondary education that were imposed by this government .
no matter how much they would like to redo history and say that everything was the fault of the previous government , that they had nothing to do with it , little do they mention , because their memory is selective , that they left behind when we came to government in 1984 a debt that had increased 1,000 per cent fold under the leadership of the Liberal government , including this Prime Minister .
that is a shame .
this is reflected again in the ruling of Speaker Jerome on November 9 , 1978 which reaffirms the principle unequivocally .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
that is the sad part about it .
the ink was not even dry on those cheques .
changes in Bill C - 4 build on that success by providing for a more modern Canadian Wheat Board , one that is more accountable to farmers , more flexible and more responsive .
yes , Mr. Speaker , indeed I look forward to a solution to national unity issues which have had a very checkered history .
i find it unfortunate however that the responsibility for the Canadian Wheat Board was given to another minister , who no longer heads the Department of Agriculture .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
Ms. Aileen Carroll ( Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford , Lib . ) :
we saw that in the last Parliament with the hon. member for York South - Weston when he tried to represent his constituents .
standing ORDERS
Mr. Speaker , it has been a full week since Canadian passports were found on two men believed to be Israeli counterterrorist agents operating in Jordan .
each year thousands of communities across Canada celebrate this special occasion .
i did say that this generation of Canadians is the best educated one .
Mr. Jim Gouk
as the minister responsible for the wheat board has explained , under the legislation the current commissioner structure of management would be replaced by a part - time 15 member board of directors .
when exactly can we expect the first surplus after the balanced budget , and exactly according to the Liberal numbers , how much is that surplus going to be ?
before coming to this place I was the president of the Kitchener - Waterloo multicultural group .
i supported it at the time and said publicly during the election campaign that my preference was for a separate truly Department of Fisheries and Oceans and I still stand by that .
Tammy Grono had written Corrections Canada and requested that she be notified of any changes in his status .
* * *
when one considers that in the last session of parliament , just half of the 35 th Parliament , we had over 400 votes in this House , how is it that he expects to consult and get fair questions to all of the constituents , to get them back and to process them to find out how his constituents feel and still do it with the resources that are available ?
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I refer you to Beauchesne ' s citation 3 which describes some elements of the Constitution Act as follows " If the electorate so wishes , the system presupposes an opposition ready and willing to attack the government in an attempt to have its legislation altered or rejected '' .
our government plans to focus its energies on that .
the Speaker
just as we cannot rack up personal debt and expect there to be no consequences , neither can the country .
like many other aspects of the legislation these tools are enabling .
how does our colleague react to that ?
nays
our farmers reap their harvest and the young return to school .
Mr. Minister , do you support -
last month he was told his application had been approved but even now it appears that the department is backtracking and wants more clarification on a range of items .
it is absolutely critical that we all work together to reverse that trend .
Quebec ' s anglophones will no doubt do a fine job of representing a sovereign Quebec within the Commonwealth ' s institutions , and we will be proud to have them representing all Quebecers there .
Mr. Speaker , my question today is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans .
we are encouraged already in our efforts by the amendments introduced by a member of the United States Senate and a member of the United States Congress to this effect .
that is the way it goes .
that is why we will take a very broad approach to promoting and strengthening our unity .
as it is 2 o ' clock , I would like to proceed to Statements by Members .
already this policy is resulting in inconsistencies in port policing from harbour to harbour , as ad hoc deals are made replacing the uniform federal system .
if there was a $ 1 billion cutback in the payroll tax , there would be about 9,000 jobs created .
fishing Industry
it should give the money back to the provinces , as they know much better how to use this money where it is needed .
health
Mr. Lorne Nystrom :
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen :
for the foregoing reasons which will be expanded by my colleagues , I urge members to defeat the bill , to send it back to the minister and the department , and to demand a real Canadian Wheat Board reform act suitable for preparing the board and the producers it serves to cope with the demands of the 21 st century .
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire :
foreign AFFAIRS
i spent 20 years in the consulting business in Alberta .
members of committees and ministers working with committees have an obligation to ensure that they themselves and those whose expertise they seek , be they personal assistants or departmental officials , respect the confidentiality of their documents and the integrity of their deliberations .
is that agreed ?
remember , part III refers to pooling while part IV refers to single desk selling .
the words of the Conservative Senator are in contrast to those of her leader , who has nothing to contribute in response to the backward step represented by the Calgary declaration .
Mr. Bill Matthews
stony Reserve
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
let me take a moment or two to tell the House a bit about my riding of Halifax .
i too look forward to working very closely with him over the years ahead .
he should know that the Liberal Party collects cash contributions .
i am not so sure that the government has made the same type of sacrifices that private enterprises made .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his very generous words about the work I am trying to do in favour of renewing Canadian federalism .
Mr. Jason Kenney
we inherited a financial mess .
the reforms will strengthen each pillar to ensure that all Canadians , including those who will not retire until several decades from now , will have an adequate , affordable pension which they will be able to count on when they reach retirement age .
that is democracy .
these people are being put through a meat grinder .
there will be 15 directors in total and two - thirds of them , 10 directors , will be elected directly by prairie farmers .
the NDP is divided between members in Atlantic Canada , in the west , but with no seats at all in central Canada .
the residents of the riding have placed their trust and faith in me .
in partnership with provincial governments and the private sector , a Canada - wide mentorship program will be developed .
thankfully the Senate did an admirable job last year in travelling to Newfoundland to hear all the views and concerns of interested parties .
we would have had a bill with statutory adjustments respecting provincial jurisdiction over natural resources , respecting provincial jurisdiction over worker training , respecting provincial jurisdiction over social services , respecting provincial jurisdiction over housing , respecting provincial jurisdiction over tourism .
this legislation provides the principles to determine whether a provincial vote to separate is valid and would require partition of any provincial electoral areas not voting to leave Canada .
the Tories gave us the hated GST .
i also congratulate the hon. member on her maiden speech .
Australia and New Zealand have already done it .
the hon. member needs to know that as we enter into the millennium we can do it together .
my question is for the minister of human resources .
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) :
we do not always agree on everything , but at the end of the day we come together .
let me ask the parliamentary secretary how in the world can they expect us to believe that the subject of this major raid against Hamas did not even come up in their meeting ?
as a lawyer I would like the member to explain why he thinks it is inappropriate and incorrect to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada on matters of international law .
another proverb says that righteousness exalteth the nation , but sin is a reproach to any people .
although he had no previous experience , the government appointed him ambassador to Haiti .
it is for the taxpayers who will be paying the bill for the people on the trip ; the people who pay $ 1,000 a year on average because of trade barriers in Canada .
we are now having this individual work and co - operate with us to determine exactly how it happened .
it is important to note that .
it will have access to all the operational information it needs to make decisions about the proper functioning of the wheat board .
we have a responsibility to present and future senior citizens to oppose this legislation and protect our public pension plan .
petitions
we note today that the Department of National Defence has not done a thing to recruit women .
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett
i am sorry to interrupt the minister , but the hon. member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot has the floor .
she has promised a policy of co - operation with the provinces .
this has to be a concern .
Mrs. Sue Barnes
we felt cash buying had the potential to undermine the board and as a result farmers ' confidence in it .
originally funded with deposits from the R 茅 gie des rentes , the Caisse should reach assets of $ 2.6 billion by 1976 and of over $ 4 billion 20 years from now .
instead TAGS tied them to a government program , destroyed their hopes and betrayed their trust .
i am reminding the other parties that the Bloc Quebecois has already made a commitment to accept only contributions coming from voters , from individuals .
we found ourselves in a position from the actuarial studies that stated that changes had to occur in the plan .
the government would like us to think that there are none .
today we find out that CSIS agents did indeed meet with the Mossad agents on the very eve of the mission .
however two and a half months after I requested it , the bill has not materialized .
i was constantly asked what was happening to our country and why , when we have the privilege of living in the best country in the world , we would want to destroy it .
i am also taking this opportunity to thank the voters of West Nova for asking me to look after their interests -
Ms. Marlene Catterall ( Ottawa West - Nepean , Lib . ) :
it was a very narrow defeat .
he will give him the best advice .
i would begin by saying how proud I am of the vision and the commitment to Canadians that we find outlined in the Speech from the Throne .
i want to review a bit of the background , a bit of the history , so they can have that level of confidence improved .
the LATE ALISTAIR FRASER
our government has been addressing these issues , the size of government , taxes , debt , from the first day that we came to office .
it is interesting that is almost d 茅 ja vu in this place .
the Speaker :
i understand the emotional aspect of her speech , particularly at the end .
believe me , at this point no one is worried about that .
Mr. Werner Schmidt :
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard :
until the House decides to give me a new set of guidelines to work by , I will try to recognize all members of the House who feel when they have a legitimate question , that they will get , I hope , what they feel is a legitimate answer .
may we live up to that expectation , to the expectation of those who elected us , so that together we may work to make Canada a truly great nation .
hon. Hedy Fry
the second difference concerns disability benefits .
we need to see many more free votes in this place , real free votes , where individuals regardless of partisan political stripe can really represent the interests of their constituents .
Mr. Randy White
Ms. Alexa McDonough
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
but in a broader sense we as federal members of Parliament have an even greater obligation , and that obligation is greater than to our own political parties .
i ask the minister a supplementary question .
we know for a fact that there is an individual currently working in the minister ' s office under investigation by the RCMP .
it has reviewed these items and made its decision .
indeed , the Homes First Society has displayed that uncommon sense of public duty which Stanley Knowles so well embodied .
we are perfectly happy to see the provinces select different methods to consult their citizens , and we hope that at some point they will adopt resolutions in their respective legislative assemblies , each province according to its own lights .
no single sector could have all the answers .
there are only 2,100 of them left out of the 12,000 .
Ms. Beth Phinney ( Hamilton Mountain , Lib . ) :
this arrogant attitude is an insult for all the Quebeckers who prefer to remain Canadians .
let us all wear the pink ribbon and show our support for women confronting this dreaded disease .
the objects , as stated in clause 5 , are as follows :
at meetings we are supplied with tables filled with fruits and croissants , melons , grapes and strawberries .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
you rightly deserve your position .
if Canadians have the will and determination we can resolve federal - provincial concerns , we can resolve aboriginal concerns and we can resolve linguistic concerns .
it was because -
therefore , the committee must be satisfied that Quebec can use section 43 of the Constitution Act , 1982 , without the consent of Ontario .
farmers may divide on their support for the Canadian Wheat Board .
i would advise him to do a little better research .
in my riding I have a program called CAPC , a federally funded social program to assist young teenage parents with a nutritional program and prenatal care .
* * *
as we look forward to the beginning of a new millennium with new challenges and new opportunities , we can look back at the last century of Canadian history and state with certainty that Canada is rightly regarded , the world over , as an extraordinary success .
Ms. Marlene Jennings
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire
i have only asked a Speaker to do this once before and it was Speaker Fraser in the context of the North American Free Trade Agreement .
the FAMILY
medicare has suffered and lies wounded .
the Deputy Speaker :
debt SERVICING AND REDUCTION ACCOUNT ACT
i feel that has to be taken seriously although the concern does prejudge the outcome of what the hearings will be and what the fate of the resolution will be .
in these circumstances is it too much to offer those groups and citizens a forum so they can make themselves heard ?
on the contrary , we must always preserve and promote the values and traditions that Canadians hold dear .
Mr. Speaker , as a black Canadian from Quebec , of aboriginal and French descent , I am very proud to represent the riding of Notre - Dame - de - Gr 芒 ce - Lachine in the 36 th Parliament of Canada .
considering the way the government has been acting , it can no longer afford to give anybody lessons in public ethics .
agreed .
we would , however , better serve the national interest by changing the way our federal system works .
is this what the member is talking about ?
Mr. Speaker , if there is someone who has fought for the French fact before every court in Canada , it is Justice Bastarache .
he told the Minister of Public Works and Government Services , and the President of Treasury Board .
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron ( Verch 猫 res , BQ ) :
the proper and equitable course to follow is to wait until the RCMP investigation has taken place to see if they will lay charges and what happens if they do .
in this emerging new economy , more than ever people and innovations are the keys to growth and wealth creation .
i would like to invite all the members to visit this wonderful region where people have never stopped working towards a stronger Canada , a part of Quebec where anglophones and francophones have rubbed shoulders for many generations and have learned to live and work together .
that end is greater prosperity , hope , growth and opportunity for Canadians through tax relief .
these include Australia , Argentina , Bolivia , Columbia , Mexico , New Zealand , Peru , Singapore and Uruguay .
this minister learned last night on the CBC that one of his assistants may be directly involved in the worst affair to hit the government in three years and here he is saying he did not know , he did not check .
the federal government was lending the funds in the CPP back to the provinces at less than market rates .
it is the record of a government that has left Canadians poorer today than they were in 1993 .
maybe not a lot of people in the House know that 13 Reform MPs out of a caucus of 60 had 60 percent support or over at the polls on June 2 .
we want politicians who are qualified to look after our national affairs and to have depth of wisdom and a commitment to principles .
the real intent is or ought to be to care for Canadians in their retirement years , to provide adequate income for seniors as well as income for disabled persons .
captain Palliser became famous , or perhaps infamous , for saying that the region was " unfit for human abode '' .
the support I have received to prevent this move does not end there .
we have a very positive role to play as well .
Mr. Monte Solberg
some say to get rid of the board entirely and we recognize who those people are .
the hon. member for Durham should understand that my parents ' laughter is now gone .
one of the conditions under that program was that some of the money was to be returned .
Mr. Speaker , I would first like to congratulate you on your role .
they were pretty reasonable people .
CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
although there is great hope for our country and for this global trade that is moving toward us , we have social problems in this country that parallel third world countries .
i thank the House and my colleagues for their indulgence .
i admit that many business people make important contacts on these trade missions .
according to the throne speech , the federal government will establish a national plan , with national standards , a timetable and a fiscal framework to set up its new discovery in the area of meddling and duplication : drug insurance .
we would structure the Canada pension trust to be completely independent of the government of the day .
* * *
the reality is our younger generation has other benefits which have been given to it by government .
if I am to hear more facts about support that is one thing , but if we have new facts to bring forth that would be another .
justice
i hold that to be a very sacred right but it is not a popular view to hold right now in my province .
that is absolutely disgusting , anti - democratic and typical Liberal .
Mr. Preston Manning
it was an absolute travesty .
what I would like to see are those changes I talked about previously as well as the possibility and the opportunity of perhaps some voluntary co - operation of producers with the Canadian Wheat Board , an opt in and an opt out opportunity for producers .
also , the company that is building the hotel is not Videon .
during our first mandate we demonstrated the leadership Canadians expect from their federal government .
when Claude Ellis passed away on October 1 , parliament lost a former member , Saskatchewan lost a distinguished educator , but most important the Ellis family lost a husband , a father , a brother , a grandfather and a great - grandfather .
if any member of this House has any evidence that we should be investigating , let them place it before us and we will investigate .
why would the government pay Brian Mulroney ' s bills including his huge PR tab but it will not pick up the $ 30,000 legal bill for the government ' s fall -
what is the hon. member ' s government going to do to correct the error it has made and help those veterans become eligible for the veterans programs ?
we have since obtained physical possession of the passports and submitted them to forensic examination by our own Canadian experts .
Mr. Michel Gauthier
this is a result of successive decisions made by this parliament and provincial parliaments .
considering what is at stake here , namely our ability to participate fully in the economy of the next millennium , the shortsighted vision favoured by the Liberal government is cause for concern .
has the minister ensured that the funds that were paid out on behalf of the Canadian taxpayer to this Canadian organization did not find their way to the terrorist organization in Sri Lanka ?
as well , in his report today , the auditor general stated the obvious .
as I was saying earlier , the head of Raglan , of Falconbridge in New Quebec , is Gerry Bilodeau .
it goes on to state :
i thank you for first of all for reminding me and second , for your excellent presiding over this Chamber .
madam Speaker , that is an interesting comment .
madam Speaker , I congratulate you on your new office .
today ' s paid workers contribute to the CPP to pay the pensions of those who have come before them and who have contributed to building their hospitals , their educational institutions and the quality of life we now have in this country .
Mr. Speaker , similar allegations have been made by a former CSIS agent and a former agent of Mossad .
Mr. Denis Coderre
in my riding 50 p . cent of the people who voted for me are New Democrats .
it is something the committee has to discuss and arrive at a position .
i must congratulate you .
it was sad to watch Lucien Bouchard clutching a bit of paper telling journalists what President Chirac had just told him .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
the Government took some important measures to address this problem in its budget of February 1997 .
statements BY MEMBERS
this is a not - for - profit body , or as it states in its letters patent , a corporation without share capital , constituted under part II of the Canada Corporations Act .
that is evidence introduced before a quasi - judicial body of the government .
does it want less choice for consumers , or more power for monopolies ?
Mr. Robert D . Nault
obviously workers will have to pay twice : once for their RRSP and once again to guarantee the benefit for current seniors .
JEWISH COMMUNITY
that the Committee be directed to consult broadly and review such information as it deems appropriate with respect to this issue ;
in the context of funding the obligations to older Canadians , we can also give more retirement security to younger Canadians at lower cost than what the government is proposing .
my son Tyler , who is 12 , goes to a French school in Pembroke , Ontario .
i appreciate that the prime minister has also said the vote on the amendment would be a free one .
however , under the exclusion clause in the new legislation it will be possible for this option to be extended to " any kind , type , class or grade of wheat and barley . "
he badly misinterprets it .
let the investigation take its course .
we believe there are many flaws in this proposed seniors benefit .
some hon. members :
but we most certainly recognize Quebec as a unique people .
this was to be a transitional measure , however the government has responded to farmers who saw no need for this step .
all the old western populace movements , R 茅 al , Social Credit , the Progressives , the CCF , which later became the NDP , all had a spiritual dimension to their beginnings and their mission .
more specifically , Canadian Forces Base Clinton , a base that was located in my riding , was primarily responsible for this function .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
i do not think that the federation is so broken that it cannot be fixed .
could the minister confirm , after she checks out what she is doing with the Government of Vietnam , that the federal government is greasing the wheels with the Vietnam government for acceptance of these deportees , that it is using an $ 8 million CIDA contract in Vietnam headed up by Marc Lalonde , a former government minister ?
we will be hearing a great deal about this with four federalist parties represented in the House of Commons .
if the Minister of Finance is really committed to job creation , he must heed another suggestion made by the Bloc Quebecois and lower the rates of contribution to the unemployment insurance fund by 35 cents on every $ 100 of insurable earnings .
to maintain the promised rate of return he passed the funds of new investors along as dividends to earlier ones .
when we look at the different options we have , one thing we have to weigh when we do have government expenditure is how many jobs are created because we have a major unemployment problem all across Canada .
time has come to take new approaches and to offer new solutions .
we believe the system cannot respond quickly anymore to changing market demands .
here is a grand opportunity for the member to expand on the NDP version of what it means to have fair taxation .
i think we would all agree on that .
we respect the French factor in Canada , but Quebec is not the sole governance of that .
we are exploring several , even though we are only the official opposition and do not nearly have the resources of government .
we are talking about an option .
partition , a reference to the Supreme Court , doubt cast on the rule of the simple majority , a country wide referendum , all threats and fears are fair game .
they are going to issue quarterly financial statements .
speaker Fraser felt that the Speaker had a role to play in these matters .
people develop .
Mr. Jim Jones
Ms. Bev Desjarlais
we have approximately 3.7 million plus another 1.2 million under the Quebec pension plan .
it has a profound impact on jobs .
more importantly , the reputation of the government and the court will be irreparably damaged if all the evidence were to come out . "
the Chair has ruled that the amendment is in order .
i would like with your permission , Mr. Speaker , to salute the Minister of Finance who introduced medicare , Mr. Sharp , who is in the gallery .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , first I want to recognize and thank my hon. colleague from Blackstrap for seconding my bill .
this word being unparliamentary , I call on you to ask the member for Bourassa to withdraw that remark .
bill C - 2 is another example of a government that does not trust its own people to make decisions with its own money .
it is also disrespectful to the new political reality of this House and its members .
i think that is what we need to look at here today .
we met that crisis with a program that was put in place to help 40,000 people who had no income .
there are more examples .
it has been repeated in the briefing book and was repeated by the parliamentary secretary this morning .
as I sat alone in the House of Commons many times , she always reached out to me .
the member for Bourassa spoke about promises , promises which , need I remind him , were not kept .
members have also noted that we have two years ' worth of benefits .
i do not believe that we can continue to send transfers to Atlantic Canada all the time without other reforms that go on to fix the economy fundamentally so that it can take advantage of its ties with New England and that sort of thing so that we can ultimately give Atlantic Canadians the hope that they really do need and really do deserve .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
why is the government always dropping the ball when it comes to the future of our country ?
in part they indicate that the Government of Canada and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation have begun secret negotiations with the province of Ontario , that the people who own and operate co - operatives have been excluded from these negotiations , and that the Government of Ontario has already breached its own agreements with provincially funded housing co - operatives .
it is great for me , I feel very strongly for that part of the country , and there is no problem .
* * *
i would like to mention to the hon. member that it is true that , while in the south bread sells for between $ 1 and $ 1.06 , in Nunavut , New Quebec , bread can cost between $ 2.50 and $ 3 .
i would ask the member for Oak Ridges to make one last brief statement , should he wish to do so .
third , I am concerned for the self - employed worker who will consequently be hit hardest by the changes proposed in Bill C - 2 .
that is what I will be trying to achieve in the next four or five years .
i ask , Mr. Speaker , that the remaining questions be allowed to stand .
i remind my colleagues , both new and old , that we are representatives of Canadians like those in St. Catharines who have concerns about jobs , about health care , about their children and grandchildren .
CESO volunteers are skilled Canadian men and women who willingly share their lifetime of practical experience with those who need it .
this House is supposed to be looking ahead .
now , adding insult to injury , the minister wants to relocate the centre to the outskirts of downtown Saint - J 茅 r 么 me , which is the economic capital of the Laurentides region .
yea .
we will ensure that the Canada pension plan is there for future generations , that it is there at an affordable premium and that the benefits are guaranteed for those future generations .
small and medium size businesses need to make the transition to new technologies if they are to survive in today ' s market .
it is quite lengthy and sets out requirements for the Minister of Finance to state his intentions over the next few years to forecast the finances of the country and to give reasons on a yearly basis as to why he is not meeting his targets .
in such a context , government would act as a guide , a mediator , a catalyst , becoming less intrusive in the private sector but vigilant over the integrity of the national economy and of national standards - . The
that is shameful .
canada POST
that is what makes the neo - conservative and market force argument so disingenuous .
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to recognize Paul Henderson who grew up in my riding of Huron - Bruce .
we want to be independent .
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard
last week , the minister seemed as surprised as we were to hear that Canadian passports had been used in a terrorist operation .
at this stage I pay tribute to his wife Bessie who has been an activist for many years , to his three sons and his daughter and to their spouses , to his grandchildren and great - grandchildren , and to his friends .
we are making the federation better able to serve the differing needs of Canadians across the country .
the question is simple and straightforward .
hon. Jean J . Charest
their leadership will be sadly missed .
i ask members to simply join in applauding Ms. McLaughlin for her hard work , her compassion and her contribution to Canada .
as a Quebecer , I am a first class citizen .
in this Parliament over the next few years we will resolve it .
the Deputy Speaker :
as I mentioned a few moments ago , certain features of the investment board were taken from the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement du Qu 茅 bec .
the riding of Ahuntsic has one of the largest concentrations of seniors in Quebec .
he has experience dealing with juveniles , working in the justice system , and he has some expertise and some inside knowledge of what needs to be fixed in the justice system .
toward the conclusion of my speech I will briefly touch on a couple of areas of concern .
they are not supposed to slip by this government or any government .
by the time this Parliament is through , the Liberals are going to know the difference .
he has , for many years , spent his holidays with francophones .
i would like to expand somewhat on this difference , because it intrigues and almost worries me .
members
they are not allowed to vote the way they think is in the best interests of Canadians in general or their constituents in particular .
we are referring this bill to committee prior to second reading .
what I ' ve learned on the sidewalks of Shawinigan , at the kitchen tables of rural farmhouses , and with workers on factory floors enriches all I do here as a member of Parliament and Prime Minister .
the deficit has been reduced significantly and in a year or two we will have a balanced budget .
we could only hope that they find solace in the wonderful life he lived and the contributions he made to education and to the public service .
Mr. Speaker , I suggest to the hon. member that he might want to take a look at the legislation .
three large regional development programs , the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency , Western Economic Diversification and the Federal Office of Regional Development of Quebec will account for nearly $ 1 billion in government spending in 1997 - 98 .
everyone knows of his tremendous efforts to introduce social measures in this House .
i heard some members opposite talk about the fact that many people with technological skills were being hired south of the border .
the Bloc Quebecois is delighted and congratulates Intrawest management on its wise decision .
at the time the minister had no better course of action , and those were exactly the instructions he received , like the other ministers .
the Speaker :
what does the hon. member think of this ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
hear , hear .
it certainly was not the kind of policy that would allow the plan to garnish surpluses ; quite to the contrary .
many of the people who try to bring new technology to the area of communications are thwarted time and time again by the CRTC .
at a public meeting I called in my riding a number of months ago to coincide with the release of the health forum report , I was made very aware of the concerns many Canadians have about the responsiveness and the accessibility of our health care system .
canada PENSION PLAN
what is behind this political decision ?
madam Speaker , I listened to the speech of the hon. member and I have a couple of questions .
i listened with interest to your ruling on the subject .
* * *
i wonder if the member would like to comment on how things like the section 745 hearings have an effect on the people ' s frustration with the justice system .
we have rejected that as one of the darkest moments in our history as a country .
Ms. Susan Whelan
that is patently false .
it is now up to us to project that history into this new millennium by securing and sustaining that nation Canada which has been built .
in my case , as I mentioned , my wife is of Irish - Scottish background and my daughter is 11 years old .
first of all , I would like to thank the voters in the great and beautiful riding of Charlesbourg who have chosen me to represent them .
we look forward to building , continuing to build what is a great country and offering our children even more than what our own parents left to us .
Mr. Paul Forseth
i even go get -
i would hope that the committee would not have to be instructed to take into account the matter of democratic consent or the rule of law or the matter of whether or not it is in the Canadian national interest .
Mr. Speaker , I move :
Ms. Aileen Carroll
finally , after four years of delay , the government is poised to announce two new helicopter contracts to replace the Sea Kings and Labradors .
i worked two or three days a week in the law firm and was paid for my services .
i would also like to congratulate you on your appointment as acting speaker .
we know it is Mr. Pierre Corbeil .
Canadians are a people .
Mr. Speaker , no doubt that will win a lot of points with the boss .
it is a bit disingenuous for the government to say that this was an attempt to close off debate .
the Speaker ' s attention to this matter is appreciated .
we have to proceed on this and we have to proceed together .
entering politics in 1960 Mayor Edwards was elected to the Whitby Public School Board .
he is asking me to be honest .
why will the NDP not attempt for once to be constructive as we head into the 21 st century ?
i watched what the Tories did .
foreign minister Levy expressed his regret at what had transpired .
today we begin debate on Bill C - 2 , which is a very poor attempt by the government to remedy serious flaws in the design and management of a major part of Canada ' s social security system .
Ms. Marlene Catterall
this government is therefore addressing the situation today .
Mr. Andr 茅 Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) :
i can say as well that we are committed to excellence in medical research .
Mr. Chuck Strahl
we are talking about $ 700 .
the minute there is a surplus we should go back and start mending the safety net that has been ripped and torn apart by the Liberals and by the Conservatives before them .
i want to underline it by pointing out that the government has not consulted with Canadians on this whole issue , probably the most important economic decision that it will make during its mandate .
if the people who made the abuses by offering to peddle influence are guilty and are charged , they will go to jail .
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is trying to play down the significance of the statements made by the President and the Prime Minister of France , who very clearly indicated they would respect whatever decision Quebecers made .
the first is to draw the attention of hon. members , in particular members from urban ridings , to the importance of agricultural reform .
he spoke of his generation and we , who are of an older generation shall I say , share the same concerns and feel more acutely the urgency of finding a solution to these problems .
i will be happy to speak to the issue of return .
there are several stages to go through still .
let me say frankly that we have lots of work to do .
with interest rates increasing , when is the minister going to recognize that the only way to create jobs is to start cutting taxes ?
* * *
could the member elaborate on that ?
the deliberations will be conducted in a true spirit of partnership , federally , provincially and interprovincially .
one of his closest friends passed away two months ago waiting for a transplant operation .
Mr. Bob Mills
it is a situation that everyone regrets enormously .
Mr. Speaker , in my opinion it is simple .
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia ) :
Mr. Speaker , Bombardier Inc. of Canada , an exporter of quality Canadian technology throughout the world , employs thousands of Canadians .
this government also believes that a healthy society contributes to a healthy economy .
the Canadian Constitution contains four different amending formulas , each of which is used for amending different parts of the Constitution .
some hon. members :
a people perhaps for the province of Quebec , but a Canadian people for the nation .
companies specializing in plastics , packaging , pharmaceuticals , steel , telecommunications and automotive components are part of the broad sector .
benefits for these applicants will be calculated based on the applicant ' s maximum pensionable earnings at the time of disablement instead of at age 65 .
i feel that having been here in the previous Parliament I should clarify some of the misconceptions which he expressed in his speech .
Mr. Dick Harris
here is another theme that we have heard nothing about .
it was defective then because indeed the provisions only lasted for seven years and had to be renegotiated on an annual basis thereafter .
the Canada pension plan has been with us since January 1 , 1966 or almost 32 years .
one of the PC members mentioned that she has heard the same thing .
how many times did we hear people say that Atlantic Canadians are lazy and do not want to work ?
no , that is not what I said .
however , allow me to conclude by providing a framework for pension reform which is broader , deeper and more future oriented than what we find in this bill .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Justice .
with respect to pay equity in the federal public service , the President of the Treasury Board said this week in the House , and I quote " We stand ready to apply the various judgments once they are made final '' .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
that would certainly lessen the power of the bureaucracies within Ottawa and would also lessen the ability of those with economic clout to pressure cabinet ministers to make decisions .
contributions get bigger when those people are in power .
it is precisely this ability that marks the signature of a great leader .
at the same time we have to worry that there is the appropriate amount of regulation to ensure that Canadians are not victimized by those who would swindle them or make unfounded demands or put improperly labelled products on the shelf .
* * *
for Quebec , it meant the loss of a number of powers conferred on it by the original Constitution .
* * *
while I was travelling through the communities in my campaign I could not help thinking it was truly a lesson in geography .
these programs and measures are only part of the solution .
Mr. John Solomon
this means they will have to pay $ 3,270 a year in 2003 , thus removing financial incentives .
as far as I know , there is no problem on the time .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien
there are the results of a questionnaire that was sent out to all members of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business a couple of months ago asking whether there should be a renewed federal - provincial infrastructure program .
in the health sector , the federal government ' s responsibilities are those that are recognized in the Constitution .
oh , oh .
Canadians trusted the Liberals with the current pension plan and now it is in a $ 560 billion debt hole .
my question is simply this .
they should stop reading newspapers and making allegations .
it is the rising tide of poverty and all the consequences of crime , violence , substance abuse , the breakdown of the family .
i was once fortunate to hear the Rev. Jesse Jackson speak when he tried to explain the difference between the social democratic view of the world and the other side , the corporate community , the neo - conservatives , the neo - liberals .
the federal government will cut $ 42 billion from transfers for social assistance , post - secondary education and health .
the member believes there is only one taxpayer .
will the member acknowledge that one of the keys to dealing with the problem is to lower taxes so we have a greater demand for all the people who have been trained ?
i would ask the hon. member to go directly to his question .
they are not asking for favours .
Mr. Speaker , Niagara - on - the - Lake , a town I have the honour of representing federally , may rank as the second prettiest town in the world .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
if we look toward the future , we see a Canada in which the harsh reality of economic change gives way to new opportunities , a Canada where jobs and growth support a stronger society , a stronger nation .
we will continue our efforts to support access to post - secondary education and to ease the transition from school to the first job .
this motion should fool no one .
Mr. John Bryden :
that will be our contribution to this throne speech debate in the area of social reform .
the increased spending promoted by the member , and I presume her party , would require additional borrowing .
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua
according to what I have read so far , he has the agreement of the opposition parties to do this .
it is not surprising that election - minded politics like this have undermined the credibility of our institutions .
will the minister explain why this vital program is now almost out of money ?
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
however , they may not necessarily agree with our views on how this world should unfold .
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for his kind words , of course .
members and senators on the committee will therefore want to assure themselves that the passage of the proposed Quebec amendment in no way establishes a precedent prejudicially affecting minority rights in other provinces .
i would have liked to have asked him had the opportunity existed , and perhaps the hon. member who just spoke can comment on it , if he is really proud of the latest expenditure by the Canada Council .
SOQIP , the mining exploration company , will foster more systematic exploration and development of subsurface resources .
there are important issues that have to be considered and discussed .
what we have is an upper chamber which reflects the reality of over 100 years ago .
i am sure that the hon. member will be able to participate in that debate and add very articulately to it .
No.
what the minister and this legislation have proposed for the first time in a very long time has come from farmers themselves , from producers .
they have full access to working documents .
it is surprising but at the same time I suppose somewhat remarkable .
Mr. Speaker , the reason we are here today at what we like to call the question period late show is that we have been unable to get any straight answers from the government for a solid week on the matter of Canadian passports being used by Israeli agents in Jordan .
it disproportionately attacks women by basing it on family income and it discourages people to save for their retirement .
we are happy to see him and look forward to be closer to him and to see him more often than in the last Parliament .
parliament should discharge these responsibilities by applying to constitutional amendments allowing for educational reform the three great tests of democratic consent , the rule of law , and the Canadian national interest .
then , we can talk about democracy and decent things .
this government has proven that a balanced record and a balanced approach are best for Canada and what guarantee a great future for this country .
he should watch the program on the French network of the CBC this evening , at 7.30 p.m. He would get to know me better because tonight is about who I am really , behind the image .
Georges this .
for this reason I was extremely pleased that the federal government , along with the Business Development Bank of Canada , initiated a $ 500 million lending pool to help accelerate development in private sector , four season type resort areas .
bill C - 221 .
endangered SPECIES
more specifically , this legislation would prohibit lawsuits to be filed by inmates against the federal government for matters arising as a result of or during their penitentiary sentence .
let us understand that they are frightened to death that we are going to pass on a burden of $ 600 billion worth of debt to their children .
we will not be carrying on paying out pensions now and leaving it to a future generation of Canadians to worry about how they will pay for their pensions then .
reformers are not listening to the people .
Mr. Jim Jones
why did a person in the employment of the parties continue to work for the party ?
Mr. Michel Gauthier :
Mr. Speaker , I would only suggest that the member should visit some of the modern day mines in Canada and look at the work that is being done for environmental reclamation .
the throne speech was particularly silent on two issues the Minister of Justice had said concerned her , violent young offenders and victim rights .
the question arises , would Bill C - 4 allow aspects of a dual market or voluntary marketing through the Canadian Wheat Board ?
but when he talks about the rich and the poor , I wonder if he would care to share with the House , although he was eligible for the 3.5 years that he was not in the House to take his own MP pension , whether he did that .
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau
as a founding member of the centre , I want to congratulate the board of directors , the staff and especially the volunteers who work in this key player in the Laval community .
it is not the position of the official opposition that the Canadian Wheat Board should remain as it is or as it was .
Mr. Peter Stoffer :
health
hon. Paul Martin
more and more we see that Canadians are striving to ensure stronger financial security in retirement via retirement savings plans .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
there are those in this House who would fail to adhere to the words of Sir John A . Macdonald : " Let us be English or let us be French but let us always remain loyal and above all , let us be Canadian '' .
congratulations to all members of Parliament .
the new foundation ' s mandate excludes social sciences , a key sector that is seen as secondary to research .
does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move this motion ?
we can make our country fit for heroes to live in .
does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to so move ?
term 17 has been amended twice .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for posing the first question of my new position .
the Leader of the Opposition is fueling fear and hate through his espousing an extreme Canada that is anti - bilingual , anti - multicultural , anti - rural , anti - immigrant , disunited , weak and Americanized .
let us remember the performance of the present Prime Minister when he was Minister of Finance from 1977 to 1979 .
i may point out that when the seniors benefit comes into effect in 2001 , benefits for our neediest seniors will increase .
the whole philosophy behind the Canada pension plan is that it is a social program .
agreed .
the newspapers also reported this morning that he had warned the Prime Minister ' s office last spring .
we have a debate in this country over where we are going to go in terms of the direction of Canada .
similarities with the situation in Newfoundland make it necessary to exercise some caution .
Mr. Guy St - Julien
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia ) :
the impact of the changes will be shared among retirees , future survivors of retirees and recipients of disability benefits .
economic prosperity is increasingly the result of research and technological development , rather than the development of natural resources .
when it comes to the cost of administering the Canada pension plan versus millions of private super RRSPs I do not think it takes rocket science to figure out that administration costs would be approximately $ 20 per person through the CPP versus $ 150 or $ 200 per person in a private RRSP plan .
i would certainly not accuse any of my colleagues of having such intentions .
what is shameful is to try to make political capital when you do not have any proof .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) :
Mr. Bill Blaikie
means to promote economic development of art must be explored .
" i have discussed your concerns with the associate chief justice and like me he is prepared to take all reasonable steps possible to avoid a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada on these matters . "
he has returned to Canada .
you have your language and culture , in your country , as do we Acadians .
there were members across the way , people who used to be members , who are collecting $ 3.4 million .
therefore , I urge you not to allow our Constitution to be amended , particularly section 93 .
this prime minister hurts the cause by his apathy .
Mr. Speaker , that was an awfully vague answer about a specific question .
building a Stronger Canada
if his party would recognize that , we might have a better way of working together in this country .
Mr. Brent St. Denis :
again I congratulate all CESO volunteers and especially my constituent , John Cochrane , on a job well done .
Mr. Speaker , there was no reference to words like ethics or integrity in the Prime Minister ' s reply , nor was there any reference to those words in the Speech from the Throne this year .
we believe that seniors must be protected with the Canada pension plan and it has to be put in place to be sustainable .
his government said in the Speech from the Throne that it cares about unemployment in general and about youth unemployment in particular .
Mr. James Henderson and Mr. Bruce Wamsley both served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during the second world war .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Calgary Southwest , Ref. ) :
he may only summarize the petition in his remarks .
i was pleased to hear earlier that the government is committed to working in partnership with our aboriginal people .
to show how ludicrous some of these interprovincial trade barriers are , a constituent of mine in the Peace River riding had a contract to do some gravel work using some of his trucks up in an area seven miles from the British Columbia border in Alberta .
provides one example of how people at the local level in business , government , education , social agencies and unions helped this region make a transition from old industrial Ontario to a new knowledge based one .
the compromise is to move to fuller funding than we have today .
this report will be sent to the provincial finance ministers and will also be tabled in Parliament .
they deserve to be complimented and I am proud to do it .
i certainly recognize it and I applaud it .
if we work together we can overcome those challenges .
Mr. Paul Mercier
specific benchmarks must be established now .
speech FROM THE THRONE
the government ' s own finance department said in a research paper that cutting payroll taxes does create jobs .
i want to pay tribute today to the Minister of Finance for his remarkable achievement in managing the finances of the nation .
young OFFENDERS ACT
moreover , the Liberal government is dropping the solemn commitment made after the referendum to recognize Quebec as a distinct society , after putting it in a motion passed by the House of Commons , and after repeating it in the form of an election promise in its second red book .
Mr. Peter Stoffer
what is he going to do ?
it should be about community involvement and community participation .
during the weekend , hundreds of residents of the Magdalen Islands expressed their opposition to the closure of the Magdalen Islands marine radio station , which the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is about to announce .
the premiers have agreed on a work plan and on the main areas of discussion .
hon. Allan Rock
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate the member for Rosemont .
the whole idea of the baby boom population burst has been talked about for at least a decade , certainly within my frame of reference .
we will keep bringing them forward in the House .
hear , hear .
i have become a federalist with my heart in the mountains and in the province of Quebec , because of that .
* * *
we insist that the finance department conduct those computer runs if it has not done so and that the minister table those results in the House so that members will know how many jobs are being killed by the payroll tax hike required to finance the provisions of this bill .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to welcome the new member for Madawaska - Restigouche to the debate .
" more specifically the matter of applying the following three tests for such a proposed constitutional amendment : the test of democratic consent , the test of Canadian national interest , and the test of the rule of law '' ;
or will it continue on making its appointments in secret and behind closed doors ?
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien
we would select the Canada trustees on a non - partisan basis , recruiting experts in the financial business and actuarial community in consultation with the provinces .
madam Speaker , I wish to advise you that I will be sharing my time with my worthy colleague from Joliette .
led by dramatic improvements in computing and communications , this knowledge based economy is changing the determinants of success for individuals , companies , regions and countries .
" to give an idea of our plan , we are now going to charge double for premiums or 77 percent more , but listen to us , Canadian people , we are going to charge double but we are going to manage it so well that when you retire we will pay you less than what you would get today if you retired '' .
as always when questions of privilege are raised I am very much interested in them and how they affect the House .
i think of B.C. Hydro and some of the strategies that the leadership and management of that company are engaging in to encourage a changed relationship , a stronger partnership with aboriginal people .
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire :
let me read into the record some of the evidence of that .
not everywhere in Canada .
i should probably take on the challenge of convincing him of the contrary before the end of the year .
i will give an example .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
even Singapore ' s Central Providence Fund will not be able to meet even the modest levels of retirement benefits estimated by the Central Providence Fund itself .
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I am pleased to rise on behalf of the constituents of Erie - Lincoln and Niagara Centre to present two petitions , both on the same subject .
i mentioned that the policy of passive investment in domestic equity will help smooth market entry for the fund .
under different circumstances I would be horrified that the government would even suggest putting such a short timeframe on the committee .
he is also asking me to exercise a directive power under the existing Canadian Wheat Board Act to which the opposition is unalterably opposed .
on the Wednesday he wrote to the RCMP as if there was some amazing new revelation that he had received to blow the whistle on corruption in that fund .
i would like to ask a question in closing .
yet we are being told that the good times are back .
that the National Assembly authorizes the amendment to the Constitution of Canada by proclamation of his Excellency the Governor Canada under the Great Seal of Canada in accordance with the following text :
i said , in response to a question by the member who asked us to do so immediately , that I did not reject the idea .
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY
* * *
fortunately , Quebec does not have to worry because it has set up its own system for contributing effectively toward its economic development .
Funnily enough , he too was appointed a judge , but with the tax court .
now this quiet Atlantic revolution is sending shock waves through the world of politics .
the performance of the fund could be evaluated on a regular basis to guarantee and ensure Canadians some transparency on how well it is being done .
maybe they would give up their MP pension plan if they really started doing that .
Mr. Speaker , Dr. Michelle Brill Edwards uncovered dangerous safety violations at Canada ' s health watchdog , the health protection branch .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member ' s question does not pertain to the administrative responsibilities of the government .
he was elected to Parliament and quickly became an expert on procedure .
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
* * *
i say with " great pride '' , because the constitutional amendment proposal introduced today by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , whom I will not name , is an important step in a debate which , in Quebec , lasted 30 years before a consensus could be reached .
as a result , Canadians can be the masters of their own destiny .
this is welcome news for students in my riding .
Canadians are looking to strengthen their roots in this country .
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
this competition was created to honour Canada ' s most beautiful municipalities in their efforts toward community and environmental improvement .
i welcome the suggestions made by the member for Qu ' Appelle .
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) :
the Liberal government promised that retired people and those over 65 on December 31 , 1997 would not be affected by the change .
some of your colleagues to your right and in front of you are now receiving two salaries from Quebec , at $ 36,000 and $ 32,000 .
it is one provincial government which allows women to sign away their entitlement to CPP benefits .
i suppose the reason I appreciated it is because he expressed sentiments which I and which members of the Reform Party hold very strongly .
in order to restore faith in the integrity of government , will the prime minister convene an independent inquiry into how the government doles out contracts ?
impaired DRIVING
we would like to see that moved into something more of an indictable area .
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague across the way for a very good speech .
but the Minister of Finance is skirting the issue because he obviously does not want to cut in that area as he does without hesitation in social transfers to the provinces .
that is not what Canadians have told us .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
Mr. Speaker , in the past few days we have heard a lot of talk in the House about passports .
the entrepreneurs the government says it wants to help have been required to spend up to $ 1 million to complete this regulatory marathon and submit literally thousands of pages demanded by the application process .
in the name of Stanley Knowles and others who have fought so hard for these issues , we will be as vigilant as possible to ensure that every person in this country is able to live with security , dignity and hope for the future .
they understand that Liberals throughout the history of Canada have never looked back , except to remind the opposition time and time again of the realities of Liberal success .
if Parliament agreed that such a vote was valid , then the Government of Canada would be required to hold a binding national referendum to authorize it to negotiate terms of separation .
* * *
Mr. Speaker , I think the minister was saved by the bell .
that is Canada ' s bilingual character .
the gentleman does see a contradiction between two of my paragraphs .
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to introduce by private member ' s bill in the House today .
we note that the government ' s motion directs the committee to consult broadly .
if this is what is going to happen , then we will have a DIPP and a TPC program which have not been paid for .
industry Canada ' s industrial research assistant program has helped to improve the quality of Niagara vines and Niagara wines .
they do not belong in our justice system .
the transfer payments , which should have been used to share the wealth and rebalance the means of meeting the needs of the population , are being used far more by the federal government at this time to make the provinces subservient to its centralizing domination .
this is unacceptable .
Ms. Jocelyne Bujold - Girard ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :
i think of Stanley Knowles as a servant of Canada , as a servant of his party , as a servant of this House and a servant of the common people .
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia )
one must listen to hear .
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
is this on another point of privilege ?
one of the benefits of living in a federation is that we can help those people who live in areas where there are problems .
that is why I believe it requires very clear directives from Parliament in terms of how these funds are to be used .
we will pursue this course and take further action to encourage new investment , to create new jobs , and to generate the national wealth necessary to assure Canadians a stable and secure future .
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) :
the foregoing provisions are contained in a specific section of the bill , which indicates clearly that denominational school boards and the right to dissent shall remain in force until such time as the Government of Quebec regains its full legislative powers in the field of education .
putting the meat of the legislation in regulations does not allow Parliament a direct opportunity to investigate government policies .
how come he did not run in Yorkton this time ?
to the Canadian Foundation for Innovation to enhance the structure of our universities and our hospitals when research is conducted , $ 800 million over five years .

criminal CODE
nevertheless he was .
i ask the hon. member to continue the debate .
the design of this bill is to ensure that there is scrutiny and that we get a handle on the fact that revenues from user fees have doubled in the last 10 years under Liberal and Tory governments , something that should concern all Canadians .
and more than five members having risen :
by doing so , however , they are the ones discrediting democracy in Canada by deriding the rules underlying it .
these unarmed citizens ended up facing the Ontario Provincial Police riot squad and the tactical weapons squad .
nothing , not a single helicopter .
however I suggest this setting up of straw men is simply a way of disguising or trying to mask some of the more real defects of the bill .
as a matter of fact , there were major deficiencies in this respect .
health CARE
the government also made a promise to shift resources from lower priorities to higher priorities knowing there is no new money until the budget is balanced .
i find the official opposition to be rather interesting .
now I come to my conclusion .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 3 , an act respecting DNA identification and to make consequential amendments to the Criminal Code and other acts .
* * *
they will then remain stable .
obviously , you know what they do .
bill C - 2 proposes increased contributions , the creation of an independent agency to administer the plan and a reduction in benefits to those least well off in our society .
Alberta and Saskatchewan were not yet provinces .
as things currently stand in my region , the future looks vulnerable and difficult .
to ensure that farmers are well served , the directors will be entitled to full disclosure of all facts and figures about CWB operations , including but not limited to audited financial statements .
let us have some appreciation for where Canadians are at and let us make sure that from here on the government hears what Canadians are saying .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .

as I have emphasized today , we are committed to collaboration and partnership with all those who , in good faith , will work with us to realize the wonderful opportunities that await Canada and Canadians .

it is time they were exposed to the people of Canada .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
( the sitting of the House was suspended at 2.06 p.m. )
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
they were just trying to delay debate rather than having a real debate .
i am not naive ; I know we still have a ways to go .
the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition was in fact not that a referendum alone would determine constitutional amendment but that there could not be a constitutional amendment without a referendum in addition to the other clauses that he suggested .
they want it to be put on a sound financial footing , and they want it to be managed efficiently now and in the future .
in other words , all he has to offer as a solution is to cut $ 6 billion less than he had planned .
we believe that we can solve the problem .
in future years we will be able to reduce not only the deficit but will also make a positive contribution toward reducing our outstanding debt .
Mr. Bourassa had gone much further , and if Daniel Johnson agrees to bow and scrape for mere crumbs , he will go down in history as having bowed and scraped for just that , mere crumbs , putting his electioneering interests before Quebec ' s true interests .
the world has experienced protectionism and has suffered through its consequences .
now that the health of our public finances is progressively improving , we have to put forward an action plan for the future .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
let us never come to believe there is such a thing as a tolerable level of child poverty or that the growing gap between the rich and the poor is ever acceptable .
chief ELECTORAL OFFICER OF CANADA
the money did not actually disappear .
i personally recognize it as quite distinct .
i think they can bring invigoration and a fresh spirit to this institution which sometimes shows signs of age .
that money could then be used to invest in places like Cape Breton .
banks have never been shown to be supporters of the Bloc Quebecois .
if the government desires to clothe the skeleton of its national unity strategy with real spirit , substance and muscle , I would urge it to start accepting more substantive proposals from other quarters beginning with the premiers .
if we measure what we have today versus what we had 10 years ago , there are a lot of Canadians who are very worried .
i wonder if , in view of the tragic circumstances that his family has endured in the past few years , he has any light to shed on whether or not the penal system in this country does rehabilitate criminals .
meanwhile Bouchard is off consulting the Government of France and Quebeckers are kept in the dark concerning what Canadians in other parts of the country are proposing to make the federation work for the benefit of all .
my question for the member for Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac is not about her undeniable social commitment , but about the existence of a Quebec people in Canada .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabasca , PC ) :
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
among the reforms that we favoured was the election of the Senate .
would the member comment and assure seniors about what their status is , those who are presently drawing benefits who have reached age 65 by the end of this year .
however , if it were not passed , it would complicate things and the provincial government would have to reopen collective agreements with the unions .
is there agreement on all of the points mentioned by each of the hon. members ?
* * *
before I suspend the sitting may I bring it to the attention of hon. members that , when the counting of ballots has been completed , the bells to call the members back to the House will be sounded for not more than five minutes .
* * *
we are positioned to not only succeed but to succeed beyond the possibility for anybody else to succeed .
to listen to the voice
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , first of all I would like to congratulate you on your appointment and I would like to congratulate the member on his election .
this government rejected the amendments suggested by the Bloc Quebecois to uphold the provinces ' jurisdiction .
the reality is that fundraising is the mother ' s milk of political activity .
i did not realize until tonight that some members opposite could not participate , would not participate or were prevented from participating in this debate .
if one wishes to open one ' s eyes the answer is clear .
last time around the Liberals jumped all over the Tories who set a record for introducing closure .
the job looks good on you .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
gone is the old way of throwing money at problems without getting results .
most important , it is absolutely crucial to the creation of jobs .
and I can tell you now that my association has $ 100,000 in its election fund .
it will not be a monument made of bricks and mortar but when future Canadians look around , they will see its legacy everywhere .
it is a balanced plan that we believe the people of Canada believe in .
i will continue to examine ways in which Erie - Lincoln can seize the opportunities available to it and shall have the same access to services and programs as large urban centres .
Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
i thank the House for its time .
it seems to me that that groundwork now having been laid will ensure that prosperity will flow and we can then all share fully in that surplus position .
revenue CANADA
if he goes on like this -
even the Reform member from South Surrey , B.C. , in an article I read just the other day agrees with Ms. Carney that separation will be on the table when B.C. attempts to negotiate a new deal with Canada .
it is only appropriate despite the obvious anxiousness on the part of the Government of Quebec and perhaps the National Assembly of Quebec that this be expedited as quickly as possible , that we observe this due process and have the opportunity to consult broadly with all Canadians who may be concerned about this particular constitutional resolution .
all we find is continued support of the Indian industry , the chiefs , councils , government bodies , the lawyers , the accountants , the consultants but mostly the bureaucrats .
they are the ones who represent the associations , they are the ones who represent the farmers and they do the best job .
in response to these comments the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs almost blew a gasket in condemning the senator .
there were no exemptions at all and they urged that if there were to be a GST in Canada , it should be that type of GST at a lower rate .
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) :
what is the minister trying to hide ?
this is so obvious that no one can object in good faith to the approach taken by our government without flouting the democratic values of Canadian society from coast to coast .
i hardly think that was the best analogy to use .
we have a 140 percent increase in our exports to American markets .
* * *
these are the principal tenets of the CPP that will remain intact .
i think it takes a great deal of courage to make the kind of decision she has made today .
prayers
Quebec , which prides itself on promoting orderly and harmonious marketing of agricultural products , can only be glad that the Canadian Wheat Board has greater flexibility in marketing its products .
i believe they do not understand two things .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Industry .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i wish to repeat my position on seniors rights and to point out that October 1 of each year will always be a memorable day , because the United Nations have designated that day to mark the important role seniors play in society .
there are people who told me that a young minority would never make it on his own in a political world dominated by the old boys club , and yet I stand here today , the proud representative of Edmonton - Strathcona .
Christopher Clark of the Canadian Council on Social Development says : " It is highly ironic that proponents of dumping the Canada pension plan for private RRSP schemes often defend the idea in the name of intergenerational equity because it would be cheaper .
with the benefits of a health care system brought by , in many respects , the father of the hon. member and finance minister , and as a result of the medicare system which this party introduced many years ago , people are living longer .
these are not just political , but administrative responsibilities , as part of the administrative procedure .
why take that chance on the unity issue ?
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau ( Repentigny , BQ ) :
finally , with respect to investments , the board will be subject to rules similar to those applying to other pension funds in Canada .
i am proud of the great strides made within the tourism industry within our riding .
it is very refreshing to hear a Liberal member agree with the Reform Party and take a route other than saying how unique and distinct the province of Quebec is .
the new riding of Erie - Lincoln brings in two fine new areas , the town of Dunnville and the town of Lincoln .
this is far from the $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion EI surplus the Minister of Finance talked about in 1995 .

Mr. Michel Gauthier
post - SECONDARY EDUCATION
in the rest of Canada , we already hear people saying that Quebec has been given too much .
we will see what comes out as a result of the investigation .
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
yes , I did look in my own back yard , and in fact we are now reaping what we had sown by the previous Conservative government .
i was glad to hear the other members of the Conservative Party , including their leader , not support her views .
it is a community proud of its maritime traditions , its military contributions , its rich culture , its deep harbour and its 21 lakes .
they are not asking for special treatment .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to express my support for the appointment of Michel Bastarache to the Supreme Court of Canada .
the SENATE
finally , applicants or the minister may appeal a decision of the review tribunal to the pension appeals board within another 90 days .
the first is that CPP must be self - financing .
for example , the Strategis program and Industry Canada ' s on - line business information service have been demonstrated to business owners and managers at special events throughout this country at trade and information shows .
canada is expected to balance the budget shortly .
usually when forecasting revenue and doing a business plan , one usually likes to use some very conservative numbers .
they are about balancing our commitment to self - reliance and our belief in mutual responsibility .
i concur totally with Speaker Fraser when , in a ruling on March 17 , 1987 , at page 4262 of the Debates he emphasized that " The extent of the application of any law is a question that the courts should be asked to decide and not the Speaker '' .
to ensure that the Quebec Pension Plan would fulfil its role , which is to pay benefits , the Quebec government tabled Bill 149 dealing with the Quebec Pension Plan and amending various legislative provisions .
Mr. Speaker , we have reason to be proud of Canada ' s youth .
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) :
who are the other people ?
it is important for the member to acknowledge that to all of his electors .
in addition to that , we have as a very good example the country of Switzerland which conducts most of its business , at what we would call the equivalent of the federal level , through citizens initiated referendum .
No.
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 34 , I have the honour to present to the House , in both official languages , a report from the Canadian Branch Commonwealth Parliamentary Association concerning the 36 th Canadian regional conference which took place July 12 to 18 in Regina , Saskatchewan .
there is the prospect of further investment in this area .
that minister identified that we did have to change our relationship .
the motion is admissible .
it is one of those facts that today ' s opposition motion strangely ignores .
this is an extremely important part of having a Parliament that represents the people of this country .
the government is putting the problem right on the backs of the unemployed , the very people it should be helping .
the interests of big business and Canada ' s elite cannot be put ahead of ordinary Canadians .
the confidential documents clearly call into question Mr. Dubin ' s findings and suggest an enormous deficiency in his conclusions and in his recommendation that left Ted Thompson within the justice department .
he is committed to the democratic process or he states so .
it does not talk about traditional families who choose to have a parent stay at home to raise their children receiving tax fairness , even though this House with all party support in the last Parliament passed Motion No. 30 sponsored by the member for Mississauga South , calling for tax fairness in the tax code .
i am also concerned and troubled , if it begins to set a trend , that every issue will get managed .
we now have a few minutes for questions and comments .
it just does not work .
Mr. Allan Kerpan ( Blackstrap , Ref. ) :
it alleges , wrongly , that this new legislation would give the directors and the officers of the CWB free rein to ignore and break the law .
the hon. member has always been known to defend culture and I congratulate her for doing so .
on behalf of the House I would like to congratulate the Erin Mills Kinsmen Club on 20 years of hard work and dedicated service to our community .
what will happen to cultural events in danger of losing their sponsors as a result of this bill ?
government ORDERS
who is Michel Bastarache ?
i had not had a chance to do so and his presence in the House today is a measure of his tenacity and determination .
i ask him again :
my argument therefore is it appears that it is probably not constitutionally permissible to use the section 43 amending formula to amend the Constitution in the manner proposed by the federal government and the Quebec assembly .
liberal PARTY OF CANADA
it is one of the practical tools that can help the public overcome its cynicism concerning the absurdities of the justice system .
from Lester B . Pearson in the 1950 s to my hon. colleague , the Minister of Foreign Affairs , in his humanitarian efforts to rid the globe of the hideous and maiming land mines , Canada has shown itself to be an independent leader in this arena .
it is my hope that the members of the House will seriously consider the bill ' s intent and purpose .
sound economic management and the best federal finance minister in Canadian history are restoring balance to the nation ' s finances .
this government has had the intestinal fortitude to look at a situation that was breaking up .
some hon. members :
it should concentrate on managing the investment resources Quebec needs for the greater effectiveness of government policy and that of the private sector .
i think everyone would agree the member is very naive if he is suggesting that Canadians voted with one voice on the government ' s fiscal platform in the last election campaign .
request FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE
many of my constituents have expressed concern regarding the usage of herbal remedies and the regulation of these natural products .
i commend the organizers and supporters of tomorrow ' s fundraising event .
as a 30 - year - old member in this Chamber it was very nice to have somebody sitting at that table who could fill me in on the rules that everybody else knew .
some factors must be considered .
i want to remind the House that over the last four years we have also been working hard to promote innovation , advance the information highway , increase trade and create opportunities for Canadians in the new economy .
when we get an NDP government .
Mr. Speaker , on Wednesday residents of Vaughan - King - Aurora gathered at St. Joan of Arc High School in Maple to discuss the Speech from the Throne and the government agenda for the next few years .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources .
to be fair , this is an effort by the government to do just that .
we have already instituted many changes in terms of leadership , management , training and many other factors which affect the Canadian forces , so that we can all continue to be proud of the good work that they do .
this sends a clear message to business : " Give money to the Liberals or you won ' t get government business '' .
also , we must bear in mind the economic implications of the commitments that will be made in Kyoto .
Mr. Andrew Telegdi
we also need to reassure Canadians the funds will not be mismanaged as they were in the past .
Mr. Speaker , on Sunday , October 5 Canadians from across the country will run for the cure .
the people of Dauphin - Swan River celebrate this diversity with enthusiasm throughout the year .
we also heard that the communities want the authority to deal with their own children restored back to them .
Mr. Speaker , I believe that the federal government has an important leadership role to play in our country with regard to protecting endangered species .
under normal conditions perhaps a highway is a provincial issue , but this deal is anything but normal .
we want transparencies so the rules are clear to all participants in the system .
he will be missed .
this is exactly what we did before the last election when Canadians spoke strongly and decisively .
hon. Allan Rock :
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Ms. Bev Desjarlais
with this game plan Canada is poised to lead the industrialized world in economic growth this year and next and beyond .
third if the exclusion is viewed as significant by the board of directors , a vote among producers must be held .
it is the country ' s biggest single earner of foreign exchange .
this should be enough for the hon. member to shut up .
how could this happen ?
the appeal process will be streamlined and the legislation will be applied more consistently .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) :
since I do not have much time , Mr. Lesage concluded his historic speech , saying :
Mr. Speaker , I know that it is not because you failed to exercise your duties but rather the government has been willing to not only tolerate but actually sponsor first the training and then the hiring of replacement workers who have replaced workers earning barely above minimum wage and who are coming up to a one year anniversary of the time when they were locked out from their jobs here on Parliament Hill .
what really matters is translating this into practical initiatives that can make a real difference in the lives of our youth .
i want to move into the technology partnerships Canada program .
Mr. Michel Gauthier
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
once again , with all respect , I remind you to address your remarks to the Chair .
here in Canada the health protection branch is strangely silent .
many of my constituents have faced that challenge , particularly in Elliot Lake .
they did an exemplary job and I would like to recognize them here in the House .
but you will know that at Westminster and in other Parliaments , Speakers have sometimes taken upon themselves the responsibility of ensuring that the rights of Parliament collectively are not abused by a government which moves too quickly to closure or to time allocation .
i am not prepared to sit here and have the Supreme Court of Canada trashed in this House .
in light of the developments of this afternoon I would like to point out to the Chair that in sitting here along with some of my colleagues I could not help but notice there was a motion which , from my vantage point , I perceived to be one of disrespect and even to be threatening toward the Chair .
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) :
* * *
the Speaker :
today , the government has a duty to do something to help women because , in addition to the numerous cuts , the government also reduced by some 26 percent funding for women ' s programs , which were already operating on a shoestring budget .
knowing what works is just the first step .
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister ' s silence on issues as important as this one is quite telling .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
i am glad that we are the official opposition because without the Reform Party here the Liberals would not even be talking about reducing the deficit .
in conclusion , Mr. Speaker , I would like to submit to you that this matter in my estimation is very urgent and is of great public significance and importance .
madam Speaker , I am splitting my time .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
lack of meaningful public involvement was the single greatest weakness of past constitutional efforts .
yes , I would like to confirm to the member that we are very mindful of the dangerous situation which all correctional officers face , which is a part of what they do every day .
Mr. Speaker , in reply to the hon. member opposite , I would simply say that any rate of unemployment is not normal .
the Israeli foreign minister has apologized to us on behalf of his government and has undertaken to set up processes , in consultation with our government , that will ensure that Canadian passports are not again misused in violation of international law and Canadian law .
in addition , the changes put forward by the federal government have been well received by at least two thirds of the provinces representing two thirds of the Canadian population .
mother TERESA
there are enormous problems on reserves in this country and the Reform Party should recognize that rather than just trying to bring aboriginal communities and aboriginal peoples down .
obviously when you have a tax on production , which is what income tax is , that is that much higher than our trading partners , it will have a profound impact on our ability to compete .
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
it is now my great pleasure to invite the hon. member for Niagara Centre , Gilbert Parent , to take the chair now .
* * *
in fact in a number of countries while our investment and our trade is going up , our market share in that region is going down .
it was then delayed to November and now it is delayed until April .
it is 74 percent of gross domestic product .
second is the presence in our gallery of members of the South African Parliamentary Housing Portfolio Committee .
unlike the Reform Party , the Bloc Quebecois will vote in favour of Bill C - 4 , because we find it a reasonable attempt to modernize the Canadian Wheat Board , its board of directors in particular .
that will make an enormous difference in resolving this problem .
many Canadians watching here today do not feel very good about politics .
while we disagree profoundly with the policies of the Bloc , we respect the democratic process that permitted the election of Bloc members to this House .
let me tell the House some of the things I heard at the all day forum .
i have been asked to assure the House that this situation will be reviewed .
standing COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRY - SPEAKER ' S RULING
so much so that we will reach a balanced budget , a zero deficit , earlier than forecasted .
precisely what alternative plan , if any , has the NDP Party created that it can offer as a viable and rational alternative to the disaster the Liberal Party has come up with ?
by way of example , I would mention the Catholic Committee of the Superior Council of Education , the Federation of School Boards , the Federation of Parents ' Committees , and teachers ' associations representing the entire teaching force of the province .
Mr. Speaker , first of all , I would like to congratulate the minister on his re - election and wish him the best of luck in his new job .
keeping with that new found philosophy as expressed in the Speech from the Throne , what is the Liberal government proposing to Canadians through this change ?
i have two questions for my colleague from the Conservative Party .
as a transitional measure reflecting historical arrangements , provinces will have the option of rolling over their existing CPP borrowings at maturity , and at market rates , for another 20 - year term .
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to bring to light the current crisis concerning the negotiations between Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers .
let me first make it very plain that I think the appointment process in this country has served us very well .
Mr. Speaker , last week ' s throne speech had little to offer Canadians on the justice platform .
i am convinced that Quebecers will heed F 茅 lix ' s advice in the next referendum .
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) :
there is no denying that in the past Canadians have not been part of the changes to the Canada pension plan the way they will be in the future .
every time I go by a Bingo hall in my riding I think of Preston Manning and the Stornoway club .
my question last week to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans was for him to call a judicial inquiry into the past and current practices and policies of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans .
madam Speaker , first of all , I would like to congratulate the new member for Louis - H 茅 bert on her speech .
yesterday , the Prime Minister said that the government would ensure that no one would use a Canadian passport for unacceptable purposes , and the Minister of Foreign Affairs responded in a similar vein .
this is the case of a preamble which was put into legislation that was fundamentally bad .
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i would trust myself and other Canadians far more than I would trust the government with the money .
this legislation , if adopted , would put an end to the wasteful abuse of the Canadian legal system at the hands of inmates .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
those of you who are here before me today represent all of the men and women who took part in that effort of Canadian solidarity .
hon. Paul Martin
he expressed his pride in being a member of the Canadian people .
in our last budgets we invested heavily in education capital from the $ 167 million for the TRIUMPH advanced physics research project at the University of British Columbia , with its direct spin - off to major industrial export contracts abroad , to the foundation for innovation with $ 800 million for modernizing advanced research infrastructures in health and medicine , environment , science and engineering , and the $ 50 million a year for creating networks for centres of excellence .
this resolution is the latest stage in an ongoing internal debate in Quebec over the past 30 years on how to change the province ' s denominationally based school system , known as the Confessional School system , into a secular system based on language rather than religion .
governments like the New Democratic one in Saskatchewan know differently .
i conclude by saying that there is a history of technical bills being introduced in the other place .
introduction and first reading
he said :
it is stuff that I have listened to for five years in opposition to the NDP in the parliament of Ontario .
and so it was with the pioneers of Canada today who brought this nation together just over 100 years ago .
i would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the prime minister and all members of the House on their election and re - election to this Parliament .
however there were no consultations on what to do with the 75 billion $ 2 coins the taxpayers send to the government every year .
fire PREVENTION
many of these points will be made by my colleagues , in particular the hon. member for Calgary - Nose Hill .
as for myself , I intend to recognize members on all sides of the House when they stand in their places to ask questions .
we want names .
even worse , both companies have at the top of the list of officers the past president of the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia .
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate the hon. member on his first question in the House and his first question as critic on fisheries .
the Clerk will issue to each member a ballot paper .
Mr. Speaker , my comments and statements will be brief .
he knows very well that taxes kill jobs .
( g ) Fisheries and Oceans ( sixteen Members ) ;
nothing in the government ' s legislative agenda meets the political expectations of the young people of Quebec .

Albertans chose Stan Waters and the Prime Minister honoured their choice by appointing Stan to the upper chamber in 1990 .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie
supreme COURT OF CANADA
i have stood in provincial legislatures and now in this federal Parliament where I have heard people talk about child poverty , the need to address this very important issue and the impact of hunger on education and learning levels .
the consequences of global warming are too serious to be taken lightly .
we heard about such things as the homeland of culture , having a unique character and being a distinct society .
i have had the opportunity to go to the borders and see the type of job they do .
let me describe them .
the only way that jobs will not be lost is to reinject that money in that area through this kind of mutual fund .
petitions
finally , the work of Mindy Ternan , the campaign director for the United Way community services in Guelph and Wellington county , can be helped through our commitment in investing in children and young people and the equal commitment in quality care and good health .
we will arrange to have it tabled as soon as possible because of course that is what the standing orders call for .
some hon. members :
so , since the government ' s finances are in better shape , instead of this nickelling and diming , instead of these intrusions in Quebec ' s jurisdictions , without so much as a by your leave , because it is so important to hand out cheques with a big Canadian flag , the Liberal government should consider what people need and put more money into the employment insurance fund and social programs .
first I congratulate you on your re - election to the Chair .
government ORDERS
today it appears the attackers may have been Israeli Mossad agents .
the Government will approach its mandate committed to collaboration and partnership with all its partners in Canadian society .
i urge the hon. member to get on with looking at some of them .
i am however relieved to hear that he has reconsidered as a result of the premiers ' initiative at the Calgary conference .
* * *
never before did a throne speech contain such direct threats to Quebec ' s right to determine its own future .
we see the most common yet most successful types of partnerships in our families .
similarly , a millennial stamp could be issued which again would mark the build - up of our nationhood .
Mr. Ted White
we have to return jurisdiction so that as they find solutions for education , as they find solutions for housing , they will be reflective of tradition , of the aboriginal tradition , the beliefs , the attachment to the land .
that is why the majority of Canadians chose a Liberal government and that is why I am a member of that government .
the CMA speaks on behalf of physicians and provides a full range of services through its member service centre and its various branches , including corporate affairs , research , professional affairs , marketing and commercial activities , professional development and public affairs .
it is spending $ 3,000 less per year - that is all it has - on food , clothing and shelter , the very basic things we need .
i will say to my hon. friend that rather obviously he has not paid very close attention to what happened in the last election campaign .
amendment to the amendment negatived
what is Reform afraid of ?
the statistics will tell us that only 2 percent of the cuts came out of downtown Ottawa and its government departments .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
he is targeting Canada ' s most vulnerable people - older women and people with a disability - in favour of his friends on Bay Street in Toronto .
Mr. Speaker , I listened with interest to the minister ' s outline this morning on the strength of our economy and the position that we are in to take full advantage of the opportunities of the future .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the C . D . Howe Institute released an analysis which confirmed what we have been saying for a long time .

hon. Jean J . Charest :
as my youngest son said to me , that was a quarter of a century ago .
there is at present a case in front of the human rights tribunal and we are waiting for that judgment to be rendered .
i think of the BHP mining company .
when one of them loses their life in the line of duty , we all mourn that loss .
that the amendment be modified by inserting after the words " young Canadians " the following : " and more particularly , to women , the disabled , those eligible for survivors ' benefits , and low income Canadians '' .
we do not see them in the legislation .
first , let us take a look at the death benefit .
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the member for Edmonton - Strathcona .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Health .
confidential financial information relative to the band is mandatorily protected by the Access to Information Act .
Mr. Speaker , I am aware that there were other people and the RCMP were aware .
the other was the rule of law and the other was determined to be within the national interest .
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard
if he did , he is ignoring the message .
i would encourage all members to encourage these new members and to give them the respect they deserve .
i will be very calm , Mr. Speaker .
* * *
the Bloc is exclusively a Quebec party .
we support the motion .
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia )
agreed .
Mr. Art Hanger :
Mr. Reed Elley
i think they got the debate off on the right foot .
fear of failure in this area of unity for Canada is not an excuse .
i stepped aside for members of Parliament who have not had an opportunity to speak yet .

Mr. Bob Mills
with a surplus of $ 13 billion , the government nevertheless reduces the number of weeks during which people will be entitled to receive employment insurance , especially seasonal workers .
resuming debate with the hon. member for Louis - H 茅 bert .
i am pleased to introduce this bill today .
i mentioned this in the House the other day .
APEC '97
victims of crime desire no special rights for themselves , only due consideration .
we are working with the provinces , students and lenders .
Mr. Speaker , I will be very brief .
these people from every region of the country told us that these youth initiatives , these employment initiatives must be implemented , to the extent possible , where the problems are , namely in the regions .
i have heard members of the Reform Party talk about not making Canadians invest in Canada and allowing them to invest all over the world .
hon. Anne McLellan
the hon. member and all hon. members will agree that all members in the House , except of course the parliamentary secretaries and the ministers , have the right to put questions .
hon. Gilbert Normand
this is a simple question .
it was shoved down our throats with the words " Shut your trap , you Quebeckers '' .
points OF ORDER
even the present RRSP system is costing $ 18 billion a year in terms of lost revenue to the federal government .
some hon. members :
* * *
some questions are still unanswered .
the sitting is suspended to the ringing of the bells .
at the moment , having come from small business myself , I know that every month they have to pay CPP taxes , UI taxes , corporate income taxes , income taxes for employees , business licences , Workers ' Compensation Board taxes and capital taxes in B.C.
the Speech from the Throne with its emphasis on fiscal responsibility , with a promise to balance the budget by 1998 - 99 , on job creation with investments in key areas like technology , on quality health care with a plan to help Canadians who care for family members at home and on youth employment with a commitment to continue our successful internship and summer job programs to create real opportunities for our young people .
to deal with the future I am working with the Minister of Health and the province to make sure the programs available to support the Stony people are managed and developed in appropriate ways .
as long as I am Minister of Health we will focus on the issues affecting the health system .
that is not so long ago .
the second section I want to touch on is the part on the optimal level of government . I point out in the second section of our paper this quote .
which of these three is the right answer ?
he is carrying on .
- the classic definition of a question of privilege does not fit circumstances in which a Member in his duties outside this House finds that his scope is being restricted or attempts are being made to restrict his scope of intervention and effective work on behalf of not only his own constituents but his point of view as a Member of the federal parliament .
i want to ask the Prime Minister whether he would agree that these allegations are sufficiently serious for him to take the time to have them checked by means of an internal investigation , for instance ?
Mr. Charles Hubbard
hear , hear .
under today ' s system the government does not have to do this .
Mr. Speaker , our government is very committed to all Canadians ' having a fair opportunity .
it is an activist slogan but then we are all activists or we would not be here .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on behalf of the people of Okanagan - Coquihalla to bring to the attention of the House another failure of the Canadian justice system .
seeing the word referendum to me was an indication that if we had a minority rights issue , we would holus - bolus take it to a referendum to remove those rights .
he arrived in our region shortly before a Liberal convention .
Canadian unity is not just Quebec and the rest of Canada .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate the hon. member for West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast on his maiden speech in this House after an absence of 25 years .
in view of that the clause stating " person or persons acting at the request of the corporation " would certainly include the employees , at least I think it would .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
in most cases farmers would carry the ultimate authority through a democratic producer vote .
that is their attitude .
with such an extraordinary mix of political parties in the House I believe the time for change is now .
they say their self - directed super RRSP given that kind of return will put the Canada pension plan system on a sound footing .
also , I am not here to defend the Ontario government but the Ontario government , with its tax cuts , is creating 30,000 to 40,000 jobs a month in the last four to six months .
however Quebec does not have the monopoly on the French culture .
anyone who studies the bill will realize that the changes being proposed to the benefits are modest .
my question is for the Minister of Finance .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
about two weeks ago one of my staff members , who unfortunately is no longer with me , went to Montreal and had the opportunity to see many buildings and homes which had been vacated because , she was told , people are leaving Quebec because of the instability the Bloc is creating with the scare of wanting to leave Canada .
when we talk of a collaborative approach to strengthening and modernizing Canada ' s social union , let elected representatives focus on allocating powers to the government level where the interests of Canadians , not politicians , will be best served .
perhaps he could tell me if it is because he does not consider Quebecers a people ?
the Canada pension plan provides a fully indexed pension system .
Mr. Bill Matthews
it is a travesty of justice that these cases proceed at a snail ' s pace and that Jerome acquiesces in every attempt by counsel for the respondents to delay them rather than pushing counsel to deal with them speedily .
naturally , after the action taken in the supreme court , it would be surprising if the government were to change its tune and try to accommodate Quebec .
the first is His Excellency Yevgeny M. Primakov , Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation .
such worries are reinforced by frequent media stories suggesting that many young Canadians will face bleak job prospects and will be forced to take work that does not enable them to contribute to their full potential .
he was above the partisan battle of the House of Commons .
i would urge hon. members of the third party to respect the will of the majority of Quebecers as expressed in two referendums and numerous surveys , and give up their plans to destroy this unparalleled success .
this is a great program to ensure that universities work with the private sector and that the best projects are funded , so that we are at the forefront , that we are the leaders .
the hopes and the dreams of the young are an inspiration for me , but in recent campaigns I heard too many fears mixed with their dreams .
it is predicted that as many as 500,000 jobs will be lost if the government continues on its current path .
they have an important job .
their principle is $ 5,000 and under .
the company that is opening that new resource understands it can build new resource models , new mining models that recognize that aboriginal people who are there on the land need to have access to the resources and benefit from these new riches that are now going to be part and parcel of this Canada we know and love .
auditor GENERAL
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
we are reintroducing -
madam Speaker , you are charged with a very important duty in the House as members seek to serve their constituents .
do you know why ?
if he had , he would not have made that motion .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
however , the fact remains that for a good portion of the public , the perception is that politicians are all the same : dishonest , self - serving and without compassion .
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) :
Mr. Peter Stoffer
( the House divided on the motion , which was agreed to on the following division : )
for instance , the throne speech is extremely vague on the government ' s approach regarding this strategic sector .
Mr. Nelson Riis
a vast majority of Quebeckers would really like - as polls indicate time and time again - Canada to work efficiently and harmoniously , would like co - operation and partnership to replace unproductive fights and what I call federal - provincial turf wars , and so on .
it marred the 1982 Constitution .
i have to say as I make my inaugural speech that I feel a very heavy responsibility as I struggle to find the ways and means to bring to the attention of this House a sense of the urgency that comes from the communities I represent .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
by connecting rural and remote communities through public access sites across Canada , we are giving these communities the tools to help further their economic and social development and make the most of their existing resources to tap new markets and create new job opportunities for their citizens .
the role of universities is particularly important in Quebec , where research and industrial development still lag behind what is being done in other developed countries with which , unfortunately , we must compete '' .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano
veterans affairs are always reviewed to see what can be done for veterans .
just as the blizzard of the century led to the flood of the century , a decade of budget cutting has led to a social crisis and what could amount to a permanent underclass in our society .
the Speaker :
the Reform member who just spoke gave a global picture of what is wrong with the justice system .
their super RRSP is a fully indexed tax deferred trust fund similar to the conventional RRSPs that promise to pay more with lower contributions , but their scheme does not take into consideration any volatility in the market .
all I know is that when I was mayor our people worked and we had a low unemployment rate .
history would make it clear that Liberal governments have put people and their communities first .

Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Lotbini 猫 re and , following that , all Bloc Quebecois speakers will do the same with a colleague from our party .
i am vice - chair of the House of Commons finance committee .
we have to have people who do not have jobs and who are living in poverty .
points OF ORDER
what was it afraid of ?
if he would read the Beyond a Balanced Budget document the hon. member will discover that there will be 1.2 million Canadians who will be off the tax roll .
can I make a humble suggestion to him .
in a way it is depressing .
the Prime Minister said during his address on the Speech from the Throne that elections were fascinating , that they provided him with the opportunity to meet Canadians of all walks .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you , sir , on your appointment to the Chair .
the Quebec Burelles moved west to Manitoba only in the 1900 s .
i had occasion to attend a University of Ottawa conference on the constitution .
i would like to speak specifically to the question of port police .
i would address my remarks to the member for Waterloo - Wellington , an educator it seems .
Mr. Claude Drouin
therefore yes , I do recognize those obligations and do want to fully fund those obligations .
to date close to 40,000 computers and 60,000 software packages have been delivered to schools across this country .
No.
that is one question .
according to the Prime Minister , this is a model government .
the minister did exactly what he was supposed to do by informing the police of the charges , and the police will conduct their investigation .
while their eldest son is engrossed in the adventure of his life , they are carrying the burden of running the daily operations of our family owned coffee shop .
some of the larger businesses in this city that hire thousands of people use that approach already .
i will be looking further into this issue to make sure the necessary improvements are put in place .
with attributes such as low taxes , quality education and health care and a safe and clean environment .
and on top of that there are 1.4 million unemployed .
if so , I would like him to mention the amount of that pension because , as a matter of fact , I stopped receiving a pension on the evening of June 2 .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Speaker :
madam Speaker , that is what I refer to when I say exploitation .
Mr. Speaker , last week ' s throne speech has once again proven to Canadians that this government is a caring and responsible government .
the paragraph reads :
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
many military historians attribute the victory in this war to the Allies ' superiority in radar air defence .
in the past Parliament many of the members opposite were most interested in passing legislation to provide alternative methods of sentencing .
since privacy rules are not important to this minister could he let the House know what guidelines he gives his bureaucrats ?
Mr. Gary Pillitteri :
i hope some ministers who are here today will think about this so that this decision can be reversed and that , next time , before making similar decisions , they will think and consult .
where is the bill to provide for constituent assemblies if and when this country ever decides to completely write its Constitution ?
Mr. Speaker , one thing I have tried to make a habit is to get the facts before I jump to conclusions .
i am delighted today to finally be taking my seat in the House of Commons and I am delighted to be surrounded by some 20 New Democrat colleagues .
that is a very big difference .
these people are considering that this may be their first and only investment until the tax structure changes in Canada to do any further development in this country .
on June 2 , 1997 they said yes to hope , growth and opportunity .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate that very much .
stony Reserve - Speaker ' s Ruling
the Bloc Quebecois intends to keep an eye on this issue to ensure that every citizen is treated fairly .
i am grateful for his contribution to Canada and I look forward to his ongoing help and advice .
i would suggest that is a fitting way to mark our millennium .
the hon. member for Laurier - Sainte - Marie .
Mr. Dick Harris :
the least the member should do is tell the House the truth .
Ren 茅 L 茅 vesque came of age politically under Maurice Duplessis and had grown to despise the dubious financing practices of the Union nationale , obviously , but also of the Liberal Party .
the month of September is an opportunity for us to recognize the work done by the Arthritis Society and its 10,000 dedicated volunteers .

on top of that , the employment insurance fund will run a surplus of almost $ 13 billion by the end of the year .

i promise that I will do everything in my power to continue to earn the trust the people of St. Paul ' s have placed in me .

( o ) Procedure and House Affairs ( sixteen Members ) ;
this petition reads as follows - I shall summarize because it is rather long :
my question to her concerns her being Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice .
now we must move forward together into a new millennium .
i will conclude by saying there are questions being raised that need to be answered .
can the minister reaffirm in this House that Jacques Roy , an employee in his Montreal office who is paid by Treasury Board and who receives his orders directly from the minister , never had any contact with Pierre Gobeil or shared with him confidential information connecting the government with influence peddling ?
it is the House collectively that makes decisions as to whether it wants to change and how it will change .
we have to do that in order to create jobs .
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
the responsibility for this anti - native act lies with the current Ontario government .
we have a quorum call .
that compassion is reflected in the fact that our pension system makes sure that in every reasonable case Canadians can provide some income for their pension .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
in 1993 , I got more invitations to travel to New Quebec and -
* * *
it was determined in that settlement that he would determine what were reasonable expenses .
and the mace having been laid upon the table :
the SchoolNet program will encourage the connection of some 16,500 schools , 3,400 libraries and 450 first nation schools to the Internet by the end of 1998 - 99 .
CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
it is contrary to the whole concept of a sharing , caring , compassionate society where programs are set up to ensure that people who have contributed to society throughout their working lives are able to live a retirement of dignity on a modest income that allows them to afford the necessities of life .
if it belongs to the working people of Canada , who will also be the recipients of the CPP when they retire , we want to know what provision the minister intends to make to ensure that employee interest , employer interest and seniors interest are adequately represented on the board .
i ask the Liberals to consider what the Canadian people are saying and I refer them to one of their own recent polls done by Earnscliffe that points out that 57 percent of Canadian people feel the government has done a poor job in reducing government waste .
i called Jacques Roy of my office this morning and he told me that he had no knowledge of any investigation whatsoever being carried out on himself .
Canadians are concerned and as members of Parliament it is our responsibility to take the necessary steps to re - establish confidence in the public part of society and make sure that the vital parts of this social union are carried on with stable and secure programs for the future .
i realize there are many services that the government provides which we all agree are necessary and essential but there is a tremendous amount of government waste .
it reminds me that the Liberals are short - sighted .
he stated in this Chamber that those veterans who were prisoners of war underwent greater hardships than perhaps any of the rest of us who were privileged to serve in World War II.
Mr. Peter Stoffer
we have broadened and opened public dialogue and we have done this for the sole purpose for what this House itself is now trying to do .
those especially are the types of issues where he should be very sensitive to the will of those who are paying his salary I remind him .
it sounds exactly the same .
the House resumed consideration of the motion .
the Government has a leadership role in preserving and enhancing medicare .
integrate information systems of all partners in the criminal justice system .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Solicitor General of Canada .
it is for that very reason that this week I took three important steps to ensure its continuing strength : first , a moratorium on future cuts ; second , the appointment of an arm ' s length science advisory board ; third -
* * *
you could not force 7 billion Quebeckers to stay in Canada against their desire .
that is the fiscal record of this government which has led to $ 47 billion a year in annual interest payments , a sum large enough to be the operating budgets of five of the the smaller provincial governments .
i want to thank the constituents of Prince George - Bulkley Valley who in the June election gave me a huge victory .
one of the mandates of the Government of Nunavut is to staff its public service with a 50 per cent Inuit workforce .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister for International Trade .
they are afraid to debate .
he is the one who decided that this should be looked into because he smelled a rat .
i am sure that many Canadians are in the same position .
the rate of unemployment among young people increased .
i look forward with great pleasure to my colleague ' s reply to this question .
bill C - 202 .
Mr. Speaker , as I said yesterday , the staffing cuts that are occurring are a result of the 1996 program review .
is that not what democracy is all about ?
$ 24 billion in surpluses under a Reform government with the chance to implement some of our ideas would mean more money for deficit reduction , more money for tax reduction and money that would go toward important programs like health care and higher education .
Mr. Bill Casey
madam Speaker , I congratulate my colleague for her excellent speech , and also for having shown some compassion , something her government has forgotten .
it is an effort that the Government will make .
it is quite interesting to listen to the speeches in this debate .
the Liberals tell us that they have managed nearly to balance the budget which they helped to create over the last 25 years with their Conservative friends .
i repeat elected to farmers and accountable to farmers .
health
the true facts surrounding this enormous violation have been ignored and some say covered up and have just been revealed recently .
this report is deemed to have been permanently referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs .
of course the system is different in Quebec , the Quebec pension plan is managed differently , but to them all this is not terribly important .
i go out and look for sponsors , supporters and people who believe in the cause .
do we fight on this issue ?
there is not unanimous consent .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
someone enjoys a rich government subsidy at the expense of others , at the expense of taxpayers and at the expense of ordinary Canadian families .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
they also cut the staff of other employment centres , like the ones in Shediac , Sackville and Richibuctou , at a time when there is a surplus in the employment insurance fund .
i will run through a short list of premiers of Quebec who , over the years , have said more than once that we were more than the Liberals wanted us to be , that we were a people .
obviously I will be fighting for job creation with investments in medical research , science and technology .
i wish to send particular greetings to the more than 3,000 members in good standing of our riding association who supported my progress to this seat right from the beginning .
i am sure every member in this honourable House respects each other ' s views whether we agree or disagree .
* * *
however I think the solution is not to eliminate those things while keeping the same tax rates thereby squeezing more revenue out of the economy .
this strategy consolidates over $ 2 billion in new and existing programs and services for young people .
world MARITIME WEEK
if they do that , I have enough faith in the sincerity and good sense of members opposite that they will embrace a real alternative for Canada and for its future by embracing a private mandatory retirement savings plan , as we have proposed .
it is a worthy objective .
Mr. Speaker , today it is my privilege to begin debate on Bill C - 2 , legislation that will secure the Canada pension plan for Canadians now and in the future .
fiscal RESPONSIBILITY ACT
however , that changed as Henderson snapped in a rebound and scored the winning goal in the final 34 seconds .
second , the Canadian Grain Commission would have to approve an identity preservation system to safeguard quality .
the Speech from the Throne , which we are debating today , marks the next stage in our government ' s commitment to work with Canadians and Canadian businesses to create and seize opportunities in the global knowledge based economy .
it is quite possible that things were going on within the Conservative party of the time , as there are within the Liberal party .
if the conditions are right foreign investments and exports will follow .
in summation of this scandalous affair , it is clear that this all occurred because these people did not want to suffer the embarrassment of a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada .
that is very significant .
i ask the member to withdraw his remarks .
although many of us here today did not have the good fortune to meet and get to know Mr. Fraser , he served the Canadian public and this venerable institution in which we sit for many years , and his memory will not soon disappear from its hallowed walls .
some hon. members :
i would also like to take the opportunity to thank my constituents of Edmonton - Strathcona .
as difficult as it was we implemented many necessary cuts , all the while keeping in mind the values Canadians hold dear , those values that set us apart from other nations .
i was born , raised and still live on the family farm .
if there is one thing the Prime Minister and the Liberal government must have understood , it is that they definitely did not get the mandate that they were hoping for and that they talked so much about at the beginning of the election campaign .
Mr. Speaker , we want to get to the bottom of this passport affair .
i will of course get myself a copy of the document he mentioned .
there were approximately 20 to 25 seconds left in the 10 minutes and the Speaker decided to terminate it because I did not feel that a question could be asked in 20 seconds and answered in 20 seconds .

Mr. Yvan Loubier :
it goes nowhere near the revenues of the government .

in Quebec , the current system provides a death benefit equivalent to six times the monthly retirement benefit , up to a maximum of $ 3,540 in 1996 .
it certainly does not bring honour to this institution and certainly does not bring honour to politicians .

in the Speech from the Throne the government placed strong emphasis on these critical issues of concern to young people .

we have been trying to find a solution for twenty years .
this legislation passed the House in the last Parliament .

Mr. Speaker , the government continues to meet its obligations in terms of pay equity .
i can confirm to the hon. member that the Israeli minister of foreign affairs , David Levy , called the Minister of Foreign Affairs yesterday .
that is the end of it .
in my opinion the yeas have it .
to create jobs maybe we should reduce the premium on the EI and offset it against the Canada pension fund which workers and organizations will have to pay .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) :
the hon. member however seems to want to continue to live in the past with the highest interest rates in history .
i think this question of privilege was raised already by a government member who had experienced some frustration and was possibly looking for a different or a better means of being able to serve his constituent through private members ' bills .
to my friends in the Bloc I want to offer one comment .
Mr. Preston Manning
now they are talking about spending money .
i have been elected four times now , twice in the provincial legislature and twice in this Chamber .
RRSPs cost Canadian taxpayers about $ 17 billion in tax expenditures and the CPP benefits also cost about $ 17 billion .
the federal government can start spending once again only because it keeps on cutting social programs and transfers to provinces and because it diverts the unemployment insurance fund from its intended purpose .
aids continues to exact an enormous toll on those inflicted with the disease and on their loved ones .
humanitarian agencies , municipal , provincial and federal officials together came to the aid of families and communities .

i have listened closely to the throne speech and the various statements from the members of this House .
we are very committed to tax decreases , which will be evident in subsequent budgets as well .
what about their MP pensions ?
we would make provisions to finance the extra costs per year of senior benefits resulting from demographic changes .
we are putting the debt to GDP ratio on a permanent downward track and we have undertaken to devote one - half of the anticipated annual surplus to a combination of reducing taxes for Canadian citizens and amortizing the vast accumulated national debt left behind by the predecessor Conservative government .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
they were too busy working .
on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois , I would like to express deepest condolences to his family and friends and , as I said at the beginning of my speech , to assure them that his memory will remain very much alive in this House for many years to come , because the volume to which he contributed is something we consult on a daily basis .
everyone knows that on reaching retirement , and you do have the option to retire early , currently you can get a pension of about $ 8,842 .
we can do this without financial risk .
she especially reminded us that we are here to speak for those who most need the support of a caring , compassionate society , for children , for the poor and for those around the globe who are suffering the abuse of their human rights .

and now he wants to lead a spending charge again .

the government has failed miserably .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
while the term aboriginal was heard 17 times during the 51 - minute speech , agriculture was mentioned once .
this regression is aided and abetted by the false start program of the Reform Party .
it is a major job creator and a great many small businesses depend on tourism for their livelihood .
during my first mandate I worked directly with street kids and youth workers and saw firsthand the problems our youth are facing today .
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to notice , I move :
the fact is under this government the debt still went up from $ 500 billion to $ 600 billion .
Mrs. Maud Debien
i do not think it is normal that necessarily the official opposition gets the first question on a government member ' s question .
Mr. Speaker , it is with great pleasure that I rise in the House today to bring to your attention that the Kinsmen Club of Erin Mills , a community that forms an integral part of my riding , will be celebrating its 20 th anniversary this weekend on October 4 .
hopefully she will be able to fulfil her promises regarding violent young offenders and victims of crime .
the principle of a new federalism will continue to guide our actions during the government ' s present mandate .
having said that , I think it is important for those of us from English Canada , from communities like Mississauga which by the way is designated as officially bilingual because of the francophone community we have there , to say that we do not want the polarization that party seeks .
that is exactly what the minister did .
will he start standing up for British Columbia instead of Washington , D . C . , and will he finally end his treasonous sell - out of B.C. fishers -

Mr. Speaker , if the member is wondering at all why some provinces are trying to do the best they can in terms of limited health care resources , he should start asking his own Minister of Health how we can revamp the transfer payment system so that provinces are not squeezed .

the main obstacle to completion has been the term consensus which was used by the negotiating committee comprising of cabinet , representatives from the federal , provincial and territorial governments .

i served as vice - chair of the Whitby seniors advisory committee -
there is still no legislation to make political party financing more transparent .
hon. Hedy Fry ( Secretary of State ( Multiculturalism ) ( Status of Women ) , Lib . ) :
i do not think I should comment further when the Leader of the Opposition has no consideration for the misery suffered by anyone in the land .
this means that , first of all , we must have legislation calling for a balanced budget ; second , objectives must be set for reducing the debt , based on a specific debt to GDP ratio ; and third , there must be specific stipulation of the amount to be put into reducing the debt .
i submit the government has neither the imagination nor courage .

before I go any further I would like to thank my family , my staff , Betty , Stan , Elizabete , Debbie and Stevie in the riding office , as well as all my supporters , all the people who were involved in the election campaign on June 2 , 1997 .
this Youth Strategy -
let us make it clear that the Liberals have been treating the EI surplus as if it were their own money to put toward deficit reduction and to cover their wasteful spending .
they want the penalties made tougher in order to make control easier .
most of my family has been in small business for the last three generations .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
where is the usual process for appointing people to the important jobs ?
we face difficulties with five official parties but the general feeling is that we are off to a good start .
citizen - INITIATED REFERENDUM ACT
there is clearly a consensus in Quebec on this , which the federal government is refusing to recognize .
there is an old saying that those who forget the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them .
there is a very real possibility it will be Charlottetown all over again .
apparently they were not ready to let the future begin for Canada pension plan reform .
from this Claude Ellis enjoyed a lengthy career as an educator , teaching in Manor , Saskatchewan , and at his alma mater of Scott Collegiate .
some members may remember that in 1994 I introduced a private member ' s bill that proposed numerous changes to the current pension system .
the most information we have heard about the management of the fund is that the Liberals will appoint an investment board .
let us just review very quickly some of the history since 1993 . We nearly lost Canada in a Quebec referendum .
employment
from time to time there have been attempts to manipulate the activities of the Caisse , but by and large , I would say the Caisse has been well rated on its performance .
perhaps Mr. Corbeil did not come to our area simply to make this one and only intervention .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
i said that I was in Quebec City during the referendum .
surely an agreement of this importance deserves the same standard of public disclosure , input and consultation that Canadians have demanded with respect to their own Constitution .
the government calls this an economic record to be proud of .
i wonder if the member agrees that perhaps his party when it was in power should have moved then in order to lessen the burden today .
we saw the exact same thing in Saskatchewan with Grant Devine and the Conservatives there .
introduction and first reading
that was said by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1993 when the Tories did the same thing .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
as evidenced , the increase in contribution rates will not be dramatic and therefore Canadians can have a secure CPP that is affordable .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
goods AND SERVICES TAX
first we will see what the provinces that agreed to work on this will do , and then we will let you know .
if not , will he do so today ?
the Liberal Party and the government are slow to recognize new things and even slower to act .
the amount of the pension will continue to be dependent on how much and for how long a person contributes to the plan .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the environment minister .
that makes it harder for our companies and our workers to compete in the global market .
they have systems that are some of the best .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
this has been in the news now for a week .
no , Mr. Speaker , I will not be committing to that today in the House .
even as a private member I was able to pass an important private member ' s bill changing the name of Trans - Canada airline .
its purpose is to divert a share of the national economic output toward retired people each and every year so people can retire with dignity .
there was no dictator who could confiscate our property because he did not like the colour of our skin .
another is the fact that Parliament will have an opportunity to review the system ' s effectiveness on a regular basis .
it would go to the super investment board , which would probably represent the largest intervention in the Canadian economy since the second world war .
given that a court has already made a ruling on the particulars of the allegation he is making , I think he may unfortunately find himself in contempt of court .
he does not seem to care what happens .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
these are only a few of the many community facilities and programs that serve and define east Vancouver as a place of strength and support for its residents .
some of it was mentioned today during question period .

hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Ms. Judi Longfield
why are we not using those companies just we are suggesting ?
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 244 , an act to amend the Income Tax Act and the Canada pension plan ( transfer of income to spouse ) .
i was in opposition once too and this kind of an issue lends itself to all kinds of serious questions as to where we are going and is the world coming to an end .
there is a section that holds parents accountable for failing to supervise an undertaking .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
we knew that the demographics of this country were changing .
what are some of the concerns ?
they might see that simply as sharing the benefits that come with a capitalist society .
Mr. Randy White
currently only 10 percent of Canada ' s small and medium size firms directly export .
i must say that over the last year and a half as I have served as leader of the New Democratic Party without a seat in Parliament I have looked on with some frustration and some horror as I have watched the deteriorating conditions for some of the people who are serving us here on Parliament Hill .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
it will create a better understanding of the true complexity and difficulty for all of us in severing ties that have developed in building a nation together .
my family arrived in Canada in 1972 .
( 8 ) to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade
all of the industry knows that the precedent set in a Newfoundland court last week will put in jeopardy resource mining development all over Canada .
we have seen those results in Ontario .
we have seen examples in Nova Scotia and in Saskatchewan .
Mr. Speaker , I am glad my critic opposite understands the circumstances that face aboriginal people .
members
the hon. member for Burin - St.
Mr. Bill Matthews ( Burin - St.
yet the rules governing the last two referendums were accepted by all parties , including the federal government .
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY
it will be operating the same way as any other pension fund does .
oh , oh .
but just 24 hours before that , the same minister approved $ 3 million out of that same jobs fund to go into the Prime Minister ' s riding .
by acting responsibly as so many of the provincial governments did ?
if , on the other hand , the committee is deluged by people who wish to appear before it and the committee can only hear a small portion of them , then the short timeframe becomes a major problem , as many Quebeckers would be denied their right to express their views on a constitutional amendment .
as there are no questions or comments , I give the floor to the leader of the New Democratic Party , the hon. member for Halifax .
we in the Liberal Party believe that we can do all of those things by providing a balance .
he should know better .
in this case , I will check the blues , but I would ask you once again to remain calm .
it was an understanding that through treaties , through a partnership we could all live in this great land and benefit and be productive .
the rules for combining the survivor and disability benefits and the survivor and retirement benefits will be largely the same as those in existence before 1987 .

Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure , on behalf of Bloc Quebecois members , to join with my colleagues in paying tribute to Stanley Knowles .
in many respects Nepean - Carleton offers the best of both worlds , urban and rural .
it is made up of Canadians from virtually every single country in the world and , as well , our first Canadians , including the Metis .
first , economic growth may be frozen because the necessary human resources cannot be counted on .
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
anything we did , any ideas we could bring forward always had to be tempered by the fact that the government was spending $ 42 billion more than it was taking in .
had we said that the federal government could solve all the problems , we would have been lying through our teeth .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
for example , if the government would create the conditions that encourage business people to hire workers , then the benefits to everyone would be obvious .
it is with some sadness that non - Quebeckers realize today that the Government of Canada and every province except Quebec should have taken Quebec ' s lead in 1964 - 65 when it established the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et de placement .
Mr. Dennis J . Mills
Mr. Roy Cullen
nothing could be more ethical , we might say .
she mentioned she has many manufacturing businesses , many retail businesses , small businesses and large businesses in her constituency , as I have .
Mr. Speaker , I must say to the hon. member that , as industry minister , I had the opportunity to travel around the world ; I have seen for myself that , as far as the quality of products , services or technology is concerned , Canadian entrepreneurs and businesses are recognized all over the world .
there is also a research component funded by the community strategy .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
chief Justice Isaac then called Judge Jerome to a meeting and advised him of the threat of a supreme court reference if the pace of the hearings into the three deportation cases did not pick up .
it will be difficult to follow that act , as it were , but I will try to do my very best .
is this hon. member willing to look at reforming the upper chamber of the House so Canada will no longer be the only major federal government in the developed world which does not have proper regional representation in its halls of power ?
these complications have not gone away .
it should be noted that the yearly basic exemption , the first $ 3,500 of earnings on which no contributions are paid , will be maintained and frozen .
our goal therefore is to double the number of companies exporting by the year 2000 , which will mean a greater take up by the small and medium size firms .
why are so many moved to such a state of apathy and cynicism ?
since he was aware of these allegations , did he inform cabinet that this kind of influence peddling was taking place during that period , as of March 6 , 1997 ?
does this minister believe that Canadian taxpayers , small business people and homemakers know better how to spend an extra dollar than do the Liberal politicians and bureaucrats ?
madam Speaker , I noticed with a great deal of interest the Reform Party ' s motion :
it does not surprise me that this government is acting in this way and we cannot expect anything different from it .
a byelection was then called , and Alain Tardif was elected , and sat in the House until 1984 , when the Conservative Party arrived in force .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
the fight against the deficit was conducted at the expense of the poor , including young people , and they will not forget , believe me .
there are two ways to destroy the Canada pension plan .
they turn whichever way the wind blows , taxing , cutting , taxing , spending .
income TAXES
two weeks later in my community two women were butchered by a man who , because he said he was stoned on cocaine , received 10 years for manslaughter .
Mr. Speaker , first of all , I want to congratulate the new member from the Reform Party on his maiden speech in this House .
he talked about the performance of the government with respect to the debt .
bill Gates has said that SchoolNet is " the leading programme in the world in terms of letting kids get out and use computers '' .
i am going to ignore most of the rhetoric from my hon. friend and make that point .
we must ensure that the government ' s priorities and commitments outlined in the throne speech become reality .
the associated economic benefits are in the millions of dollars and continue to grow each year .
once again , I urge members to be temperate in their remarks .
Mr. John Finlay
hon. David M Collenette
we will be dishing out money now for the helicopters .
this is probably one of the consequences of the notion of the global village , the world market , which makes it easier for the rich to get richer , and more easily .
they must have made CPP contributions on earnings over $ 3,500 in four of the last six years prior to becoming disabled .
already over 1,200 British Columbians have died from drug overdoses since 1993 .
i can tell you , Mr. Speaker , from my advantage point down here you look a lot better than the people to your left .
i would like to begin by paying tribute to my predecessors who have represented Mississauga West .
rhetoric about taxation levels without regard for the inclusion of the best health care system in the world is dishonest .
i think we should all take a moment to reflect on the responsibilities of a critic .
what has been the case of the MPs of the Reform Party of the class of '97 recently elected ?
judging from recent budgets and the actions taken by my colleague , the Minister of Human Resources Development , and by other colleagues regarding the child tax credit , internship programs and all this government has put in place for the poor in this country , it is very clear that what our government intends to do is to help Canadians , not to divide them .
we do not just criticize the government ' s attempts to patch up a creaking welfare state .
the prime minister ' s announcement of only 3,000 internships over three years is a perfect example of the government ' s inability to recognize the scope of the problem .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) :
Mr. Reg Alcock :
the argument that the minister is also a member of Parliament completely evades the point of this point of privilege .
it hurts middle income Canadians the most .
Mr. Speaker , I rise today also on behalf of my colleague , the member for Winnipeg Centre , since both of us share in the privilege of representing a constituency that Stanley held for 38 years .
Ms. Val Meredith
Alistair Graeme Fraser was born in Toronto in January of 1923 into a family distinguished for its political service .
we should be debating where to reinvest , not whether to reinvest as the member ' s motion states .
at our committee on small and medium size enterprises we heard businesses state that they had actually moved from Ontario into Michigan because they could do better trade with the provinces in Canada that way than they could from Ontario .
worldwide demand over the next five years is forecast to be 2.7 million alternative fuel vehicles .
i would like to see as we get to a balanced budget the revenues from the HST used to reduce the debt .
as a matter of fact , those are a very small part of the payout of the CPP right now .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member for Etobicoke North mentioned that he is in favour of tax incentives .
i do not think they are buying into it any more .
will the minister now admit to the House that the government has failed the Atlantic fishermen who turned to it for help ?
the Quebec people therefore have the right to be free of the tutelage of a majority that is not of its own .

Mr. Roy Cullen
if we look at the numbers over the last three years , the economists say that we have created over a million jobs in our last mandate .
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) :
when Laurent Beaudoin , the president of Bombardier , gives $ 100,000 to the Liberal Party - as shown in the ledgers - it is not to get $ 100,000 out of it but hundreds of millions of dollars .
the Speech from the Throne does little to promote growth in employment .
both are payroll taxes .
as to the declaration of the President of the Conseil du patronat fran 莽 ais , who said that " French economic circles are not worried " by Quebec sovereignty , the hon. member considered that it should go unnoticed in the antisovereigntist paranoia .
the measures proposed in the bill today will become law once the legislation is passed by parliament and support orders in council are received from the provinces that are party to last February ' s agreement .
this bill would bring the federal government in line with the trend worldwide for greater democratic input from the people .
it is impossible for a company to know whether it wants to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a complete environmental assessment until they know the size and extent of the ore body .

what better structure to have than those representing the aviation industry , the stakeholders , running the system , keeping the seamless safety record intact , one day with the government , the next day in a non - profit organization ?
the constituents of Kelowna live in probably one of the most beautiful parts of this country .
this government clearly states that an arbitrary number , like 8 per cent for a NAIRU , is not applicable to a country whose productivity is improving , a country where interest rates are low , a country whose industry has become lean and competitive .
about 40 percent of the people being served by Canada ' s food banks are children under the age of 18 .
the official opposition is endeavouring to ensure that this process is done correctly .
it comes from our taxes .
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Bloc Quebecois ' strategy in this debate is clearly to ask all Liberal members the same question .
we are in the House of Commons , but it is as if we were at a hockey game .
at the time , it was believed that our French Canadian ancestors and the English Canadians had signed a historic accord between two sovereign nations , two founding peoples .
committees OF THE WHOLE
had I promised in 1993 that we would be able to do that , I do not think I would have believed it myself , but we have done it .
if the government follows that advice , it will be very good for this 36 th Parliament , it will be good for Canadians and it will be good for the future of parliamentary democracy .
it deals with children and education .
the first obligation of the special joint committee must be to ensure that the amendments meet the test of democratic consent .
since April 16 , 1996 , the federal government has been withdrawing from policing airports .
it was in part of the election package and it was also in the throne speech .
and the count having been taken :
the Speech from the Throne is a product of work done not only by the bureaucrats but also by members of Parliament , backbenchers and by members of the Liberal Party who have worked in little policy groups across this country bringing forward ideas and bringing forward priorities with which they feel the government should set its policies .
today I am pleased to invite members of Parliament to meet and personally thank our radar technician veterans in Room 237 - C immediately after question period .
these highly specialized forces focus on extremely important security issues for Canada , such as illegal immigration , illicit drug trading , exportation of stolen goods and security for foreign vessels .
Mr. Speaker , the government is being completely evasive on this issue and we are wondering why .
our loudest critics are the members across the way .
Mr. Speaker , I too was quite impressed by the remarks of the hon. member for Sherbrooke and leader of the Conservative Party , who said that , with the new pension plan , the level of taxation will rise by $ 11 billion over six years .
i want to say again to Canadians watching this debate , and I hope that thousands of Canadians are watching it , that the issue before the House today and in the days ahead is tremendously important to the interests of all citizens of this country .
the hon. member should understand that under the current legislation which is before the House of Commons today , clearly two - thirds or 10 out of 15 members of the board of directors will come from producers .
conversely , if farmers want to include rye or flax or canola within the Canadian Wheat Board ' s mandate , that too can be done , again subject to three very clear conditions .
we also have tributes to Mr. J . Chester MacRae a former member of the Progressive Conservative Party .
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member , but the hon. member for Cypress Hills - Grasslands has the floor .
introduction and first reading

i would take this opportunity to point out , however , that more than a new bill is required .
it is a priority of the government .
i want to make that clear at the beginning .
today the Vancouver Sun reports that almost 70 percent of respondents support Senator Carney ' s comments , including her suggestion that B.C. should not rule out separation .
miss Deborah Grey :
from 1993 , the new member , who was the defeated Liberal candidate in Laval East , enjoyed the pleasures of Liberal cronyism until the elections of 1997 .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
i am thinking of the Minister of Industry , the Minister of Public Works and Government Services , the Minister of Health and the Minister of Transport .
recognition of the importance of post - secondary education in helping Canadians build their careers is demonstrated by the Government of Canada ' s investment in post - secondary education through the Canada health and social transfer .
my hon. friend has asked me about the GST , a very important issue .
throughout the years it has worked to lay the foundation for positive family relationships and communication in family friendly communities .
it is obviously possible to obtain provincial autonomy by becoming sovereign , at a very high cost to all parties concerned .

i welcome you , my colleague , also .
we should look very carefully at those countries that have achieved very low rates of unemployment without triggering unwanted inflation , countries like the United States , Holland , Great Britain and others .
when Ron Ready really needed the foreign affairs department , foreign affairs was inept and unavailable for him .
however , over time , we came to realize that such was not the case .
second the government ' s position that CPP contributions are not payroll taxes is completely inconsistent with the views of the employers and employees who make the CPP contributions .
the government should ensure that much younger people have the option to choose between the existing plan and the one that will be implemented in the months to come .
with Judge Jerome ' s assistance , Chief Justice Isaac responded to Mr. Thompson ' s letter assuring the assistant deputy the cases would be expedited .
Mr. Speaker , try to explain that to a mother who cannot feed her children or to the person who just lost his or her job .
does the minister still believe there should be no investigation into the reserve because of dirty laundry or is it the dirty laundry of her department that she fears will be aired ?
i have the whole list .
the prime minister sent a letter to Mexico .
we will work as we have never worked before to ensure that their voices are heard in this Chamber .
we were attempting to terminate it a little earlier but we were not quite successful .
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) :
we have eliminated the deficit which is what Reformers have been talking about .
it would sound to me , just as I see this Reformer was using whatever he could to talk about equality -
Canadian values are inherently those articulated by the Minister of Finance in his 1997 budget address .
i have a word of warning for those across the way who may be tempted to crow over the results of recent polls .
enactment of this bill would ensure that the definition of publication in the case of child pornography covers transmission by electronic means or posting the material on the Internet or any other electronic net .
" they were open for business .
you may think I am trying to be melodramatic in this august place , but this is the sad reality our constituents live with .
i would like to say how proud I am to be part of a government that has found a way to at once reflect the priorities of Canadians but in a fiscally responsible way .
first and foremost , I would like to dispel the myth that separatists like to spread that after separation there would be a friendly equal partnership between Quebec and the rest of Canada .
hon. Allan Rock
right at the beginning of the campaign we said that next year the provinces would receive $ 700 million more and the year after $ 1.4 billion and the same thing in the years to come .
contributions will rise 73 percent over the next six years to 9.9 percent but they will not rise to the 14.2 percent that the chief actuary indicated would be necessary if we did not fix the Canada pension plan .
later on in life some of us might need to have a government that will protect us .
we did not debate it the next day in the morning because we were debating Bill C - 4 .
she laughed and laughed and of course it was contagious and my father started to laugh and laugh as well , not knowing what he was laughing about .
this whole debate reminds me of a mutiny .
my ancestors came to Canada in the 1850 s .

hon. Lloyd Axworthy
the federal , provincial and territorial governments owe it to all Canadians to take responsible leadership on the unity of the country .
with his ministry being responsible for the CRTC , I find it somewhat incongruous that he would be speaking this way .
Mr. Speaker , this Liberal government treats the aspirations of British Columbians as grievances .
the goal of many of our programs such as youth service Canada is to work with community and voluntary organizations in assisting young Canadians who had previously lost hope to become self - reliant members of society , and we are doing our very best .

ways AND MEANS
Mr. Speaker , I can assure the hon. member that I am a strong federalist as are my colleagues in this party .
it is an honour for sure but also a daunting task .
a few minutes ago , we witnessed something extraordinary .
perhaps , on the other hand , the government is going to announce new programs each and every day which cannot all be included in this document unless it expands it dramatically .
my parents did that to repay Canada for their lovely entry to this country .
were any Canadian agencies involved in any way , shape or form in that mission ?
miss Deborah Grey
i have been monitoring the situation over the last couple of months and what really jumps out at me in this situation is that in essence the government is treating the people of British Columbia and Premier Glen Clark and his government as the villains in this situation .
that is a staggering amount of money .
how does Canada measure up against our competition in attracting foreign investment ?
there is nothing arm ' s length at all about the investment board .
our cities , towns , and villages reflect the diversity of all those who have come to this country .
health
as passionately committed as the member is to tax reduction , and I have done some work in this area , I am passionately committed to making sure that the human capital that has been through a lot of suffering , those people at the lower end of the income spectrum who have not had a voice in this Chamber for a long time , I am going to be with that voice .
several times in the last Parliament , we in this party suggested amending legislation on the financing of political parties in order to adapt it to a more modern context .
i am not asking him to defend his decision but I would like his views on that , please .
since the Liberal government took office there have been more than 511 emergency landings for the Sea Kings and 259 emergency landings for the Labrador .
Mr. Speaker , when the Liberals took office back in 1993 they spent a lot of time talking about integrity .
a negotiated settlement is probably the best settlement .
the people in this country who earn $ 50,000 and more pay over half the taxes and they are in the top 10 percent .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I understand very well the need to protect the integrity of the position of the solicitor general .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
Mr. Speaker , the solicitor general stated earlier with a totally straight face that he had discovered in this House that the Minister of Human Resources Development , other colleagues and the RCMP too all knew about this investigation .
i think it is appropriate to remind the member that one of the greatest destabilizing factors to investment in the province of Quebec is the constant threat of separation especially when corporations think about expanding their plants .
unfortunately when I look at the actions of this government there appears to be a cancer in this particular bone .
however , my role as your Speaker is to consider only those matters that affect the parliamentary work of members .
Mr. Speaker , I hope my bill will again get the support of the members of this House .
these young people require social supports that can best be provided by their communities .
what will be the impact on women , particularly older women who will be dramatically affected by changes to the seniors benefits ?
our plan would simply take measures to top up the unfunded liability in the plan by sensible means .
indeed I as a member have no reasonable access to the services of the legislative counsel ' s office .
it is actually the federal government ' s problem because of the cuts transferred to the provinces .
they enjoy the use of national defence .
Mr. Jim Gouk :
the second choice would be to leave the status quo , and I do not thank anyone agrees that is a realistic possibility .
oh , oh .
is he saying that 40,000 seasonal workers in Atlantic Canada should not get any assistance ?
broadcasting
that is outrageous .
i am surprised however at their lack of imagination , since an almost identical motion was presented by the same party on May 30 , 1995 .
what imagination !
to conclude my comments against the notion that the Employment Equity Act is costly , unnecessary and in contravention of the merit principle with respect to hiring , let me stress that the act is a protective measure against systematic discrimination .
we must be proactive .
how can it be claimed that an act is unnecessary when even the Canadian Human Rights Commission says the contrary ?
how can it be said it is costly when it gives one of society ' s poorest segments fair access to employment ?
and how can it be claimed that it contravenes the merit principle with respect to hiring when it expressly applies to people with equal skills ?
beyond the numbers , there is the human factor .
for many if not most people , work is much more than a way to earn a living .
it is a way to realize their potential and improve their self - esteem .
dignity is priceless .
hon. members should remember that to be tolerant is to respect differences .
Mr. Stan Dromisky ( Thunder Bay - Atikokan , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to address this House regarding Motion No. M - 104 proposed by the hon. member for Saskatoon - Humboldt .
this motion advocates that the Employment Equity Act should be repealed since it is costly , unnecessary and in contravention of the merit principle with respect to hiring and promotion .
first I will point out that the Employment Equity Act has its foundation in the Constitution of this country .
in 1982 the charter of rights and freedoms constitutionally affirmed the right to equality in employment .
Canadians believe in fairness .
this is why our Constitution enshrines the fundamental right to equality for all .
Canadians believe in giving a helping hand to those who need it .
this is why section 15 ( 2 ) of the charter clearly sanctions the creation of laws , programs and activities designed to improve the condition of disadvantaged groups which is what employment equity does .
equity means fairness and that is exactly what this legislation is all about .
fairness in employment means the removal of barriers to real equality of opportunity in the workplace .
fairness in employment means a workplace where differences are respected , valued and accommodated , not penalized .
fairness in employment means a workplace where individual talents and abilities are given the opportunity to grow , where they are utilized to their fullest .
fairness in employment means hiring based on ability to do the job , not on outmoded and false stereotypes which have been hurdles to real equality of opportunity for much too long .
the intent of this act is not to provide preferential treatment .
it is designed to ensure equal access to opportunities for all qualified Canadians regardless of their race , physical attributes or gender .
it is about removing , not erecting barriers to employment .
the act was not created overnight .
it was a product of a comprehensive review of the Canadian workplace in 1984 by the Royal Commission on Equality in Employment headed by Judge Rosalie Abella .
judge Abella quite correctly concluded that Canadians would resist the American approach given its overly interventionist government policies and the imposition of quotas .
she recommended instead that Canadians adopt the employment equity model which focuses on the elimination of discriminatory employment barriers .
our approach to achieve equality is far more progressive than the American model .
it has led to greater partnerships among groups pursuing fair access to employment opportunities and has also led to far greater success .
for example , often workers , union leaders and employers will work together in unison to establish a fair equity plan .
in this way employment equity works as much to the advantage of employers as it does for the members of the designated groups .
organizations that take advantage of and capitalize upon the rich composition of Canadian society will come out ahead , way ahead .
employment equity policies exist in this country because they are needed .
i wish this were not so .
statistics show very clearly that certain groups in our society continue to experience significant disadvantage in employment .
the member for Saskatoon - Humboldt knows as well as I do that unemployment rates among aboriginal people and persons with disabilities are way beyond acceptable levels .
women and members of visible minorities tend to be concentrated in lower paying jobs with fewer chances for advancement .
about two - thirds of the women in the workforce covered by the Employment Equity Act are employed in clerical work .
members of visible minorities represent only a small proportion of upper level management positions .
aboriginal men and women earn substantially less than other employees .
let there be no doubt , this legislation is in response to a social need .
since 1990 two parliamentary committees have studied our employment equity legislation .
it is highly significant that both committees have recommended strengthening the legislation , not discarding it .
employment equity promotes sound human resource practices .
the record shows that employers support this legislation and realize that it is good for business .
during parliamentary committee hearings on this legislation in 1995 numerous business organizations testified that employment equity means good business sense .
for example , the executive vice - president for human resources of the Canadian Bankers Association told the parliamentary committee : " We think employment equity not only had a positive impact on the way our organizations manage their workforces , but also it has proven to be good for our business '' .
the vice - president of the Business Council of British Columbia declared :
in our experience , successful businesses implement employment equity programs because it makes good business sense , not because of some legislative compulsion .
with an increasingly global or international marketplace , smart businesses have workforces that are reflective of their marketplaces .
it ' s no longer a moral issue ; it is now a strategic issue .
the point is simply that the Employment Equity Act is very much in sync with the views and attitudes of the progressive employers in this country who do not see it as onerous or costly .
quite the contrary , these employers know very well that a diverse workforce representative of their community gives them an enormous boost in their efforts to remain competitive .
despite the claims made by the hon. member for Saskatoon - Humboldt , fairness in employment need not be too costly .
for example , a recent study done in the United States by the Job Accommodation Network revealed that when companies made adjustments in the workplace to assist persons with disabilities , the cost to the employer was less than $ 500 in more than 70 % of the cases .
even more compelling is the fact that the return of the company averaged more than $ 28 for every dollar spent on such accommodation .
all these considerations serve to bear out the premise of Robert Reich , former U.S. secretary of labour , who said social justice is not incompatible with economic growth , but essential to it .
what about the merit principle ?
is employment equity indeed in conflict with merit , as the Reform Party would have us believe ?
this is perhaps the most baffling of the allegations made by the member .
a simple reading of the legislation itself ought to clear up such misconceptions .
two separate provisions in the act expressly protect the merit principle and clearly state that employment equity does not mean hiring or promoting unqualified persons .
far from being in conflict with the merit principle , employment equity is in fact a commitment to merit , as echoed in the title of the 1990 report of the parliamentary committee which studied this legislation .
the notion that employment equity is in -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member ' s time has expired .
resuming debate , the hon. member for Dartmouth .
Ms. Wendy Lill ( Dartmouth , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to speak out against the motion on the floor to abolish the Employment Equity Act .
i believe it is time to strengthen the Employment Equity Act , not dismantle it .
in a statement in the House a month ago I drew attention to the fact that the number of persons with disabilities working for the government today is lower than it was 10 years ago .
we have over four million disabled persons in this country and over two million have no work .
a shamefully small number of them work for the federal government .
employment equity legislation needs to be strengthened .
it is time shore up our employment equity legislation and not rip the guts out of it , which is being recommended in this motion today .
the reason behind employment equity legislation is simple .
the legislation covers those people from groups which have been historically denied equal job opportunities of a result of discriminatory practices .
who are these people and groups we are talking about ?
let us start with black Nova Scotians , many of whom I have the privilege of representing here .
they have been allocated leftover land .
they have watched generations of their children come up against stonewalls in the workplace and school settings .
these are the people who have been historically denied equal job opportunities because of discrimination .
native people in Canada still face the highest unemployment rate , the highest suicide rate , the highest incarceration rate of any population in the country .
centuries of racial discrimination in government and church policy of assimilation have robbed native people of their language , their religion and their heritage .
it is an incredible tribute to the strength of their culture and their traditions that they are still out there fighting for equity , for self - government , for the right to have a say in the way this country is shaped .
these are people who have been historically denied job opportunities because of discrimination .
i think it is time to challenge those people out there who want to ditch employment equity .
these are the kind of comments I hear from them : " I do not think our customers would relate to him very well , he has a bit of an accent '' , or " our corridors would be a bit crowed with a wheelchair and she probably hates being in people ' s way '' .
there are a thousand and one excuses for not considering , never mind hiring , members of under represented groups for jobs .
yet those words are never motive free .
nor merely by being uttered do they make tirades against employment equity credible , logical or fair .
anybody can claim not to be prejudice but it takes courage to examine our deep seeded biases .
only then do we know how completely we have bought into the sterotypes and patterns that make systemic racism .
i am sure members have heard " our company needs to stay competitive and it cannot do that if employment equity promotes mediocrity by raising incompetents beyond their abilities '' .
any good employment equity law is based on the principles of merit first .
qualified applicants who belong to under represented groups bring an additional qualification to the job .
they bring diverse skills that discrimination would prevent employers from even considering .
i am sure members have heard " designating people does not help them , it becomes reverse discrimination and stigmatises them '' .
let us look at that .
take women , for example .
then there is the fact that racial minorities have to make three times as many applications as white people to get one interview .
aboriginal and disabled persons face unemployment rates of 60 % to 80 % .
imagine the odds stacked against someone who falls into any combination of those categories .
that is stigmatization .
i would like to quote from a member of the government ' s former ranks who has now fled these northern climes to take up a position in Boston .
she addressed the other argument which is quite prevalent , the white male argument .
she said that despite the fears of some of our colleagues in opposition , white males get 50 % of the federal government jobs .
they get 60 % of the jobs nationally in the private and public sectors combined .
even more overwhelming , white males get 90 % of the promotions .
with figures like that I believe it would be safe to say , and I do not think anyone would argue with me , the white male is not exactly an endangered species in this economic climate .
the former member for Halifax went on to say : " I don ' t understand what it is people fear from legislation that is clearly put on the books to ensure fairness for people who have for generations , thousands of years , been systemically discriminated against because they are black , they are aboriginal , they are female or disabled .
why do people fear legislation that promotes fairness ? "
there may be precious few things with which I find myself in agreement with the former member , but this is one of them .
we cannot afford to lose the skills and abilities of this great country ' s diverse population because of discrimination .
employment equity is a program which needs to be strengthened , it needs to be expanded .
in closing I would like to mention a couple living in my riding .
two years ago they immigrated to Dartmouth from Sri Lanka .
both of them are eminently qualified for work in the legal and banking professions but they cannot even get past the door in interviews .
instead they are trying to contribute to their community through coaching soccer and volunteering in their children ' s school .
they want to be part of our community .
employment equity legislation needs to be strengthened even further to allow them to do that .
if this wonderful family is to contribute fully to their new home we need stronger employment equity .
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to remind the House that the member for Saskatoon - Humboldt introduced this motion today with regard to employment equity .
i want to let the House know that we fundamentally disagree with some of what the member had to say , but not entirely .
i think that would be a benefit to all sides .
the process that the Reform member is suggesting is a lengthy process and could be a very expensive process , and we disagree on that .
the other point I wish to make is with respect to the charter of rights .
the charter protects all of us , and that is something none of us wants to lose .
but it is a very lengthy process for anyone engaged in the pay equity dispute .
it is one that few of us would ever go through to its finality .
it becomes very expensive .
in terms of the pay equity dispute presently ongoing between the federal government and its employees I want to put a few facts on the record .
there are approximately today 190,000 public servants who would receive the pay equity allowance .
most of the 190,000 public servants are women but they are not the highest paid in the public service .
i wanted to point that out because if I go through the list of the six groups that dominate the issue of pay equity , they are not the highest paid public servants in the country .
the principal groups involved are clerks , secretaries , typists , data processors , librarians , hospital staff , hospital service staff and educational support staff .
we are not talking about employees who make $ 100,000 a year .
we are basically talking about a group of people who want fairness in the system .
we in the Conservative Party believe in equal pay for equal value of work done .
i do not think anyone would disagree with that .
fundamentally the government simply has to open up the dialogue among all major groups and come to the realization there are problems that have to be addressed .
i believe it should do that .
with regard to the back pay owed to the women of Canada who are public servants and have done their jobs for the country , they could simply say " Yes , let us negotiate a settlement because it will end a lengthy laborious legal process which becomes very time consuming '' .
let us take a look at some of the numbers so we will know what we are talking .
the numbers really speak to the issue .
the offer would mean a lump sum settlement of $ 27,037 for the employees involved .
for the largest group , which currently makes around $ 30,000 a year , the lump sum would be about $ 15,000 and future annual adjustments would account for about another $ 2,184 a year .
when we get back to the issue of the union because there are union people involved in the whole issue , the best thing they could do at this point is take the issue back to the membership .
if it goes any further than what it already has , the delay could be counted not in months or weeks but in years .
in all fairness , if they are representing their workers in the most democratic fashion , the best thing they could do today is simply settle with the government after consulting the membership .
the membership should decide the issue .
it should be consulted .
the treasury board president was quoted on September 10 as saying with regard to the latest offer " This is our latest offer .
it is not only generous but it is a bit more than what we can afford '' .
that also has to be considered by the union .
i know some union activists to the left of me are hollering a little loudly at this point .
i do not blame them .
i think they at the end of the plank on this one .
i do not think I would want to be walking that plank now if I were a union activist .
i will repeat my statement to the member for Dartmouth .
they should take it back to the union , the membership , the people who have been paying union dues for many years .
getting back to the motion itself , we disagree with the Reform member who introduced it because we do not think more legislation or more laws are needed .
our position is simple .
at present the legislation is there .
if we are to make changes to the law we should identify the specific changes .
some could be brought about by legislation , not by the introduction of a new bill .
i am pleased to have taken part in the debate today .
i respect the positions of the Reform and the NDP .
however , let us examine the issue a little more carefully to see if we can bring about the changes through regulation .
with regard to the pay equity situation , let the unions speak .
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , just by way of comment to the previous member about letting the unions speak , I suggest the union is representing its members .
it was chosen by its members just as we were chosen by our constituents .
on a personal note , I have spoken with many union members .
the member mentioned a figure of 27,000 .
previous governments including the Tory government of a few years back stalled the whole process of pay equity , in spite of the fact that the human rights commission indicated the government should be paying fairly .
that is indication that we need a strengthening of employment equity and pay equity .
when the Government of Canada does not abide by the rules it gives businesses the option of saying that they do not have to pay fairly for equal work .
with regard to the private member ' s motion , it does not take a lot of thought to understand what Canadian businesses and the Canadian workforce were like over the past few decades .
there were fewer women and people with disabilities in the workforce .
we have made some forward movement but we have not reached the point where we are being entirely fair to all people in society .
all we need to do is look at the rules in place in the RCMP .
it was suggested by the member that there should not be a need for the RCMP to relax its requirements .
i ask all members to remember when one of the requirements to join the RCMP was that a person had to be six feet or six foot one .
the member who presented the bill would have been so vertically challenged he would not have been able to become a member of the RCMP .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
since this is Private Members ' Business , the hon member for Saskatoon - Humboldt could have the opportunity , by consent of the House , to speak .
he would have five minutes and this would terminate the debate .
does the hon. member have the consent of the House to speak ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
Mr. Jim Pankiw ( Saskatoon - Humboldt , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I do not know when I have heard such a load of garbage in my life .
let the record show that every party , the Conservatives , the Liberals , the Bloc and the NDP , spoke against my motion .
they did not give unanimous consent to allow it to be votable because they do not want to vote on it .
they do not want the record to show their prejudices and discriminatory views on matters .
let us go through them one at a time .
the hon. member for Charlotte , the Conservative , said that they fundamentally disagreed with the Reform Party .
he then went on to say that the process would be too lengthy and costly .
how could it be lengthy and costly to repeal legislation ?
that would be the end of it .
it is costly to let it continue the way it is going .
then he went into a lengthy diatribe about pay equity .
he is totally confused about the difference between the two .
let us switch to the NDP .
the member wanted to strengthen it , make it even worse , and suggested that if somebody with an accent came in the people who subscribe to the view that it should be based on merit would discriminate against him .
they are the ones who are prejudiced .
that comes first .
that is primary .
that is prejudice .
that is discrimination .
now they want to strengthen the legislation to enforce their discriminatory views and ideas even further .
then they go on to talk about merit .
the member for Churchill railed against white males .
that is the single thing that prevents him from getting the job .
he is qualified in every other way .
he was told that .
finally he has given up and gone on to something else .
how fair is that to people forced to go down the road to another job instead of doing what they were more qualified to do and wanted to do but could not because of the discriminatory policies of governments like this one ?
it makes me sick .
the Liberal member went on to talk about the fundamental rights of equality for all .
why then do we have employment equity legislation ?
there are no rights to equality there .
that legislation says it will look at the colour of skin , at gender and use them to judge .
is that equality ?
is that fairness ?
they should get their head out of the sand and maybe have it examined .
i really want this to go on record with as much strength and force as possible .
the Reform Party is the only party standing up for the equality of all Canadians , and Canadians ought to know that .
the Liberal member said that he was against interventionist measures of governments and quotas .
why does he support employment equity legislation ?
that is what it is all about .
there is some degree of confusion there .
he also said that the legislation worked to the advantage of employers .
if I have a federally regulated firm of over 100 employees and I am subject to the legislation , how is it to my advantage to say to people that I have too many with the same skin colour in the position they are applying for ?
although they are the best qualified I have to give it to somebody else because of the colour of their skin .
that is prejudice and discrimination .
it is the kind of thing they are promoting .
finally we move to the statements of the member from the Bloc Quebecois .
she said that Canada was behind the concrete measures taken by other countries in this area , but there is no evidence to back up what she is saying .
she was not listening to my speech .
i listed statistics to show there is equity already .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the time provided for Private Members ' Business has now expired and the order is dropped from the order paper .
government ORDERS
DNA IDENTIFICATION ACT
the House resumed from October 29 consideration of the motion .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , Bill C - 3 is a continuation of Bill C - 104 , which is now part of the Criminal Code .
that bill allowed peace officers under the authority of a warrant to obtain a DNA sample from individuals suspected of committing an offence under a list of offences in the Criminal Code .
another condition in Bill C - 104 is that there must be found at the scene of a crime samples of hair , blood or tissue that would connect an accused with the crime scene .
bill C - 94 , the forerunner to this bill , was brought in too late to be passed at the last sitting and Bill C - 3 is almost identical to that bill .
what does this bill authorize the police to do ?
what greater tools are they going to have ?
from my understanding this bill will allow the police to obtain DNA samples from those convicted of a series of offences .
it does not mean there is any connection between them and a crime scene that would allow the police to get a warrant to obtain a sample .
it means that after being convicted of one of a series of offences listed , the police can obtain a DNA sample from those individuals .
the Canadian Police Associated , representing the front line police officers , are very much concerned that this bill does not go far enough .
they would like to see the same application of the DNA tool as we now have with fingerprints , that a fingerprint can be obtained from anyone arrested for an indictable offence .
the debate on the bill is whether a proper balance is being struck between the rights of the accused and the rights of society as represented by law enforcement agencies charged with the responsibility and duty to bring criminals to justice , investigate crimes and have a sufficiently strong record in terms of success that it would be a deterrent to those who plan and commit premeditated acts against an individual .
the bill will go to committee and we will hear witnesses on that .
i am sure we will hear further from the Canadian Police Association .
bill C - 104 , which is now part of the Criminal Code , allowed for the taking of three different DNA samples .
one was a swab of saliva , another was a blood test and the third was a hair sample .
judge Hill went to state " Since viable alternatives exist and the degree of uncertainty is so high , the procedure violates the charter of rights and freedoms ' guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure '' .
i find this judgment confusing .
nevertheless it has been struck down at least at that level of the Ontario court system .
the government is experiencing difficulties with a number of the laws it has brought to the House .
they have been challenged or struck down as being unconstitutional .
recently in Alberta a judge struck down the whole of the rape shield law , not just part of it .
it followed a decision in Ontario that struck down part of that rape shield law .
why is legislation being brought to the House that the courts deem to be unconstitutional ?
the constitutionality of Bill C - 68 is being challenged by four provinces and two territories .
the conditional sentencing portion of Bill C - 41 is a real mess in the courts .
crown prosecutors across Canada are appealing the manner in which the courts are using that law .
we are urging the government to deny the courts the right to use that law when it comes to violent offenders .
why is the justice department not doing its job ?
the government had all summer to get that bill ready .
now we are ramming it through against a deadline that need not have been there if the justice officials had done their jobs .
they would not be successfully challenged as being unconstitutional and creating a real problem within the justice system .
i have some concerns about the extent of this bill .
does it go far enough ?
does it provide the police with reasonable tools , bearing in mind the balance between the rights of the accused and the safety of society ?
does the bill go far enough ?
we in the Reform Party say it ought to go further .
it ought to be treated the same as the police demanding fingerprints from those who are arrested for indictable offences .
this will be explored further when it reaches committee .
we will be pressing the witnesses to determine where they believe that balance should fall .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the DNA Identification Act provides for the establishment of a national DNA data bank to be maintained by the RCMP .
the new act authorizes the courts to force those convicted of certain designated offences to provide biological samples for genetic analysis .
the resulting genetic profiles will be stored in the convicted offenders index of the genetic data bank .
the data bank will include a crime index containing genetic information collected at the scene of solved and unsolved crimes , and a convicted offenders index containing the genetic identification profiles of adults and teenagers convicted of specific offences under the Criminal Code .
the approach will be twofold in the case of the convicted offenders index .
designated offences will be classified under two headings : primary offences and secondary offences .
the list of primary designated offences will include serious violent offences including aggravated sexual assault , which are the types of offences for which DNA evidence can be most useful .
except under exceptional circumstances , at the time of sentencing for this type of offence , the court will order that samples of bodily substances be taken for the data bank .
the person found guilty of a secondary designated offence can be ordered by the court , at the request of the crown , to provide a sample for the data bank , if the court is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the administration of justice to do so .
how can the creation of a national DNA data bank help the police and the courts ?
such a bank will help police forces to conduct their investigations and will assist the authorities in identifying and arresting more quickly individuals who commit serious offences , such as sexual offenders and violent repeat offenders .
this will help police identify and arrest repeat offenders by comparing DNA information found at the crime scene with the information in the convicted offenders index .
this will also help authorities determine if a series of offences has been committed by a single person or by more than one person .
it will help to establish links and to resolve cases involving several jurisdictions by giving investigators access to information which otherwise would not be available .
it will also help guide investigations by eliminating suspects whose DNA profile does not match what was found at the crime scene .
it will also dissuade offenders from committing other crimes by increasing their chances of being arrested .
there will , however , be restrictions on access to samples and to DNA data .
strict rules will apply to the taking of samples and to the use and storage of biological specimens and DNA profiles .
the bill clearly states that all samples must be used only for DNA analysis and for forensic purposes .
access to the DNA profiles in the convicted offenders index and to the samples will be limited strictly to those directly involved in the normal maintenance of the DNA data bank .
only identifying information , such as a person ' s name , will be communicated to appropriate agencies , those implementing the legislation for the purpose of investigations and proceedings resulting from criminal charges .
there are provisions for criminal penalties in order to prevent the misuse of samples of bodily substances or DNA profiles .
many people , in news bulletins and in the newspapers in our region of Abitibi are asking us what DNA is .
DNA stands for a molecule known as deoxyribonucleic acid - quite a mouthful - which is considered to be the basic unit of life , the body ' s genetic fingerprint .
humans , like animals and plants , are composed of billions of cells .
each cell has a nucleus containing 46 chromosomes divided into 23 pairs .
the DNA molecule is inherited from the father and the mother and is present in these chromosomes .
it is identical in all the cells of all parts of the body , except in the case of identical twins , where each has his or her own particular DNA molecule .
in the forensic context , the expression DNA analysis generally means various techniques of molecular biology that can be used for identification purposes in the direct analysis of specific sites on the DNA molecule .
DNA analysis requires very little genetic material and samples of bodily substances can be taken relatively discreetly .
DNA analysis is an excellent means of comparative identification .
we are particularly familiar with its use in identifying the perpetrators of violent crimes by comparing biological samples taken from suspects with bodily substances left directly or indirectly at the scene of the crime by the person who committed it , or taken away from it by that person , for example blood or saliva .
since its introduction into the legal system in Canada in 1988 - 89 , DNA analysis has led to the conviction of hundreds of persons who have committed violent crimes , ranging from assault to homicide .
as well , it has made it possible to prove the innocence of suspects and to exonerate and release individuals who were already convicted .
genetic fingerprint analysis for forensic purposes is practiced everywhere in the world .
in recent years , the U.S. , Great Britain , Norway and New Zealand have adopted legislative measures to create genetic data banks for forensic purposes .
what is the government ' s strategy with respect to DNA ?
prior to July 1995 , DNA evidence had been presented before Canadian courts for some time , but there was no specific legislative framework to govern recourse to such evidence .
in order to clarify the situations in which genetic samples could be taken as part of a criminal investigation , legislative amendments were adopted in July 1995 , with a view to allowing the police to obtain a warrant authorizing them to take biological samples before , during or after a suspect ' s arrest .
as part of Phase II of the government ' s DNA strategy , a consultation document , " Establishing a National DNA Data Bank " was published in January 1996 .
the groups consulted across Canada , the law enforcement community in particular , were strongly in favour of the creation of a national DNA bank .
a " summary of consultations " was released on February 28 , 1997 .
in closing , I must say that this is a step forward and that we must move ahead in order to help our police officers to do their job .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the bill before us this morning truly combines science and new techniques , permitting a fairer society in which as many crimes as possible will be solved .
why do I say it is a bill that really reflects improvements in science ?
it is because deoxyribonucleic acid existed all along , but either we were not aware of it or we did not know how much it could contribute to clearing up cases .
it is better known as DNA .
for our viewers , DNA , to describe it very simply , involves the chromosomes found in the living cells of the human body and are like a sort of fingerprint .
everyone has their own unique DNA , and as the member who spoke before me said , even identical twins , triplets or quadruplets will have different DNAs , because of their chromosomes , just as in the case of fingerprints .
in all the years they have been fingerprinting criminals , no two individuals have been found to have the same prints .
according to science , it would never - or at least so it appears - be possible to find two individuals with the same DNA .
at the outset , the Bloc supports this action .
as it did in the 35 th Parliament , it will co - operate in the 36 th Parliament with the aim of producing a bill that is as effective and wide - ranging as possible while at the same time respecting the fundamental rights of Canadians and Quebeckers , who would have it no other way even in the case of DNA legislation .
the important thing in a bill such as this one is to achieve a balance between the fight against crime and the respect of individual rights and freedoms , particularly with procedures involving the collection of bodily substances .
in terms of the principle underlying the legislation , it goes without saying that the crime rate and the number of unsolved crimes can never be too low .
the work performed by the police deserves our attention and support , so we can help the police be increasingly more successful in their work .
however , there is something that absolutely must be said .
the public hears all kinds of things .
in this respect , the bill has the merit of providing a list of designated offences for which ordinary people would agree that police officers and the judicial system should be allowed to use DNA testing and to collect samples of blood , saliva or other bodily substances from an individual .
i will just mention a few of these offences , but there is a whole list of them .
they are all similar and have one thing in common : they are serious offences .
they include the use of explosives , sexual touching , invitation to sexual touching , sexual exploitation , incest , murder , homicide , aggravated assault , assault with a weapon , torture , rape and arson .
that having been said , while continuing to support this kind of bill as we did in the past , we do have some concerns and hope that , in committee , witnesses or the government will be able to reassure us on a number of issues .
playing with the physical integrity of individuals and their genetic identity may lead - and I am not saying it will necessarily happen - to the possible misuse of this new technology .
in terms of confidentiality , this is very important .
we do have concerns about the bill as it stands right now .
for instance , a question comes to mind about the storage of bodily substances collected under the provisions of clause 10 :
why keep samples after the DNA information has been obtained ?
the police will not be working from the sample afterwards , but from the information provided through analysis of the bodily substances .
so , why in either case , and particularly in that of the offenders index , keep bodily substances when the DNA profile has been found and is in the computer ?
i wonder what this sample will be used for ?
another concern is the taking of samples .
we should consider whether any police officer can take such samples .
however , not all police officers can take samples of blood or saliva .
i have at least three friends who are police officers and I would never allow them to take a blood sample from me .
they are better with a gun than with a needle .
it is a bit like the people using breathalyzers at police stations .
these people have received special training .
perhaps we should specify that only specially trained officers can take samples .
interestingly , section 17 of the bill stipulates that the person required to provide a sample can choose between blood , hair or any other bodily substance .
i have another concern for which I hope to receive a reply from the government , and it is the communication of a DNA profile to other countries .
of course , we can make regulations in Canada .
however , in the case of DNA information concerning a Canadian or a Quebecker that we provide to the United States , to a European country or to any other country , I would like to know and especially to be reassured by the minister that the country who will be receiving this information will treat it in the same manner that it is treated in Canada or , in other words , that it will not be possible to do indirectly what the law in Canada prohibits .
for instance , if a sample or a DNA profile is to be destroyed in Canada because the person was found not guilty or for any other reason as outlined in the bill , will the United States , for example , agree to Canada ' s request to also destroy that information at the same time so that it will not come back to Canada through a friendly country or any other country ?
i think the government should also provide greater clarification in this regard .
that being said , and since my time has run out , I wish to add that I offer my complete cooperation to the government and to the opposition parties so that we can work on making this bill the most practical and the best possible for society .
Mr. Carmen Provenzano ( Sault Ste. Marie , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I also rise to speak on Bill C - 3 , the DNA identification act .
the reintroduction of this important piece of public safety legislation speaks well about this government ' s commitment to toughen the fight against crime and to protect Canadians from criminal activity .
it also shows our government has taken the findings of our country - wide consultations on this matter very seriously .
it is my belief that if enacted , Bill C - 3 will serve two very important functions in our justice system .
first , it will give our law enforcement agencies a valuable tool in the investigation of certain violent crimes .
second , it will help shield the innocent from wrongful accusation and conviction .
bill C - 3 will build on legislation passed in the last Parliament which allows police to obtain DNA samples from suspects in criminal investigations by the use of warrants .
by sharing this information , law enforcement agencies would be better equipped to track and bring repeat offenders to justice .
these agencies would be in a better position to quickly identify the work of a violent criminal who , after eluding prosecution for a criminal offence in one part of the country , might seek to violate the peace of another part of the country by the commission of further criminal offences .
the DNA data bank would play an invaluable role as a warehouse of potential evidence which could be used to solve countless unsolved crimes and put Canada ' s most heinous criminals behind bars .
this is so because extensive scientific research has shown that with the exception of twins , no two people have the same DNA .
simply put , DNA is a biological fingerprint that can be as redemptive to the innocent as it is damning to the guilty .
take the examples of David Milgaard and Guy Paul Morin .
i believe all Canadians know of the lengthy struggles these men mounted to restore their good names and reclaim their freedom .
Mr. Morin last week described the horrors of prison and the heartache of being mistaken for a murderer .
the case of Mr. Milgaard who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit is equally moving .
yet if not for the introduction of DNA evidence , it is likely that both of these men would still be in prison today .
having said this , it should also be noted that the establishment of a national DNA bank is a delicate matter which requires Parliament to balance issues of public safety and those of personal privacy .
i therefore applaud the solicitor general and his predecessor for the fine work they have done in achieving this balance .
time does not permit detailed reference to sections of the bill , but I will highlight the following aspects of the legislation .
under this bill access to DNA profiles in the convicted offenders index will be given only to those directly involved in the operation of the data bank .
these are the agencies that at present have access to the existing criminal records database maintained by the RCMP .
accompanying revisions to the Criminal Code would ensure stiff criminal penalties are assessed for any abuse of the system .
the right balance has been struck between public safety and personal privacy .
to all hon. members , I would ask that when deciding the merits of the legislation , they think of the irrefutable and unbiased nature of the science involved .
also think of the efficiencies that will be realized in criminal data collection and court proceedings as a result of the provisions outlined in Bill C - 3 .
most of all think of how far this legislation will go toward strengthening the Criminal Code and ensuring the safety of all Canadians .
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) :
madam Speaker , I appreciate the opportunity to take part in the debate on Bill C - 3 , the DNA identification act .
DNA is basically the next generation of fingerprinting .
since 1988 trial judges have allowed DNA evidence from the accused to be introduced in several criminal prosecutions .
indeed forensic DNA analysis has been instrumental in securing convictions in hundreds of violent crimes and has resulted in the release of wrongfully convicted people .
during the early days of DNA evidence , there existed a vacuum in regulating the collection and use of DNA evidence .
in a number of cases the judges even allowed DNA samples which were taken from accused individuals who did not consent to having their DNA collected .
organizations such as the Canadian Police Association had warned the government that legislation would be needed to ensure the proper and effective use of DNA evidence .
during a 1993 meeting with the then Minister of Justice and in 1994 with the solicitor general , representatives of the Canadian Police Association raised the urgent need of updating evidence laws to include DNA technology .
despite these warnings of the men and women on the front lines of keeping Canada safe , the Liberal government decided to wait .
it dragged its heels until the Supreme Court of Canada intervened in 1994 , much the same way as it dragged its heels on the Young Offenders Act .
the supreme court ruled that in the absence of federal legislation , the police did not have any lawful means to obtain a search warrant for the seizure of bodily substances for the purposes of DNA typing .
this lack of legislation led the supreme court to determine that DNA evidence obtained without the consent of the accused risked being excluded at trial .
the government finally took the first step in 1995 for the legal framework of DNA .
that bill gave the police the right to seek a warrant that , if approved by a provincial court judge , authorized the collection of bodily substances for DNA analysis .
bill C - 104 also legislated criteria for judges to consider when reviewing DNA warrant applications .
police officers , lawyers and judges finally had some guidelines , albeit very broad ones , to govern the collection of DNA evidence .
the logical answer was the creation of a national DNA data bank in which collected DNA samples could be stored for future reference in criminal investigations or trials .
even the Minister of Justice at the time when not preoccupied with cracking down on law - abiding gun owners - another contentious issue obviously - or launching politically motivated witch - hunts , conceded the importance of a national DNA data bank .
he felt it was so important that when Bill C - 104 was approved , he promised complementary data bank legislation for the fall of 1995 .
that promise as we know bit the dust when the government started consulting on the January 1996 discussion paper entitled " Establishing a National DNA Data Bank '' .
we all know what happens to promises .
the coming year stretched into 16 months and obviously it died on the Order Paper , but it was included in the Liberal ' s red book two during the election .
i will say the Liberals at least did not use the election as an excuse to delay the importance of this legislation .
obviously it is on the floor of the House now .
with the exception of some minor changes the technical language in Bill C - 3 is what we are talking about today .
the solicitor general has outlined many of the positive elements in this bill of which there are several .
the DNA data bank to be managed by the RCMP will consist of two main components : a crime scene index that will contain DNA profiles obtained from unresolved crime scenes ; and a convicted offenders index that will contain DNA profiles of adult and young offenders convicted of designated Criminal Code offences .
because police officers will be able to cross reference data from certain convicted offenders with unresolved crime scenes , the DNA identification act is an improvement over the vacuum which previously existed in terms of storing DNA data .
the major concern of the police association is with the timing of DNA collection .
according to the CPA , a national DNA data bank will only be successful if the collection of DNA from a person charged with an indictable offence is done at the time of the arrest .
why is this the case ?
because the only guaranteed opportunity to obtain the DNA evidence from individuals charged with an indictable offence is when police actually have custody of the person charged .
the proposed convicted offenders index while somewhat useful would not help police identify unknown murderers and rapists .
it might even encourage suspected offenders to skip bail as most people charged with offences are released pending trial .
in fact if we look at it , in Canada bail is granted to 95 % of all people charged with all criminal offences .
according to Juristat more than 66,000 people in 1995 either broke bail or failed to appear as required .
therein lies the problem .
what would happen for example if someone was arrested for an offence related to juvenile prostitution which is a designated offence for DNA collection under this legislation but in this case the individual may have also committed an unsolved murder from which the offender ' s unidentified DNA was collected .
it is pretty obvious the person would know that if he is convicted of the juvenile prostitution charge , the DNA analysis would be obtained and cross referenced with the crime scene index .
then that person would be up on a murder charge .
it does not take a rocket scientist to conclude that under the current bill many offenders would choose to skip bail instead of risking a murder charge .
how would that help police in this case solve the mystery of an unsolved crime ?
i understand the fears of individuals such as Canada ' s privacy commissioner , but I believe there are ways to deal with some of the privacy concerns without compromising collection of samples and the ability to solve the most serious of unsolved crimes .
when the previous minister introduced the first incarnation of the DNA identification act , he stated the importance of getting the data bank correct the first time .
our officers do not believe that Bill C - 3 is the most appropriate measure to collect and store DNA evidence .
and if they do not , we should take a serious look at amending this legislation at the committee level .
i support the goals and objectives of this bill , but our police officers and courts need an effective DNA data bank as soon as possible .
if we allow for modifications of Bill C - 3 at the committee level , I believe we can make an effective DNA data bank a reality .
i would therefore urge my colleagues , especially the solicitor general , and the justice committee to be flexible and consider the reasonable suggestions put forward by organizations such as the Canadian Police Association .
we need to plug those loopholes such as the ones highlighted by the CPA and other organizations .
i will conclude by simply stating that if the Liberal government or any other party decides to refuse these amendments to Bill C - 3 at the committee level , our caucus will be obligated to re - evaluate its position on this legislation .
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I have been given only a few minutes to make some quick observations about Bill C - 3 , an act respecting DNA identification .
the bill would make consequential amendments to the Criminal Code and other acts and has been brought forward by the solicitor general .
in the last Parliament we passed provision 487 of the Criminal Code for obtaining a search warrant to seize a bodily substance for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis .
this was in respect of a limited list of offences to be used in the course of an investigation .
i truly hope that this bill fully extends and complements those provisions .
the bill establishes a national databank for DNA profiles , containing a crime scene index and a convicted offenders ' index , including samples derived from some who are currently serving sentences .
technology marches on .
twenty years ago no one would have guessed that we would be capable of sending such a large amount of data through a telephone line .
today we can use e - mail and the Internet to talk .
we can send information via e - mail and post data via the Internet with moving pictures .
it seems now that instead of exchanging phone numbers we exchange e - mail addresses .
soon ordinary camera film and the old dedicated TV sets will also be obsolete .
i came across an article recently by Sheryl Mercer , who is a Toronto writer , which provided me with some insight into our history .
she said that when it was introduced , fingerprint evidence caused as much controversy and furor as DNA is doing today .
when photography was first introduced , people seriously questioned whether pictures could be used as evidence in a criminal case .
today it is commonplace to use security video camera evidence of a crime .
in 1908 an order in council sanctioned the use of fingerprints under the Identification of Criminals Act of 1898 .
like the Internet and photography , fingerprinting was considered revolutionary .
the history of fingerprints is applicable to Bill C - 3 and the whole issue of DNA and DNA banking .
in 1892 Francesca Rojas murdered her two sons so that she could marry a lover .
her bloody fingerprint was left at the scene of the crime .
after identifying the print as that of Rojas , she confessed to the murders .
it is noteworthy that Foster ' s revolutionary work was even scoffed at by politicians of the day .
in 1910 a prisoner , Joe Chartrand , escaped from Kingston .
Chartrand , a cop killer , was soon captured .
when the public heard that he had never been photographed and fingerprinted they were outraged at the callous inattention .
the public was ahead of the politicians .
soon after the Kingston escape , Edward Foster was promoted by the justice minister to be in charge of the new Canadian criminal identification bureau .
the police created a Canadian fingerprint repository in 1911 .
in 1914 Peter Daracatch and Gregory Parachique , who broke into a Canadian Pacific Railway station , were the first to be convicted in Canada based on fingerprint evidence .
through this century Canadians have wanted governments to do whatever they could to make our streets safer .
we want incorrigibles behind bars .
we need safer communities .
we want efficient trials and fair justice administration which we can trust .
however , people preoccupied with their version of human rights are up in arms over this type of legislation .
they believe that the rights of some will be violated .
that is not the case in this instance .
nevertheless , striking the right balance among competing principles is very important .
unfortunately , instead of sincerely seeking that balance , Liberals too frequently find these situations requiring a kind of legislative courage not often found in their ranks .
in our ranks we are looking for the complete normalization of DNA evidence without convoluted exceptions .
in 1988 the supreme court dealt with the privacy of fingerprinting .
in his ruling , Justice La Forest stated " a person who is arrested on reasonable and probable grounds that he has committed a serious crime - must expect a significant loss of personal privacy '' .
la Forest also pointed out the purpose of setting up a fingerprint registry was to establish the identity and criminal record of the accused , to discover if there are outstanding warrants against the accused and to determine if the accused is an escapee .
the same can be said with DNA evidence .
however , a 1994 supreme court ruling disagreed .
the ruling stated that police had no lawful means to obtain a search warrant for the seizure of bodily substances for the purposes of DNA typing and that any such evidence was in jeopardy of being excluded at trial .
it is hoped that Parliament ' s response to this problem , the new 487 clause in the Criminal Code , will endure all tests .
with a history of these references over , I want to speak specifically about Bill C - 3 .
when we are elected as representatives , it is our duty to create legislation that is in accordance with the basic aspirations of Canadians .
i have travelled from coast to coast .
i have talked to many groups , some who support the policies of the Reform Party and others who do not .
nevertheless , the general consensus is always the same .
people say not to go half way against crime .
do what is right rather than what seems to be convenient to the various competing voices .
unfortunately it appears that Bill C - 3 does not go the distance .
the Liberals are afraid of going all the way .
they are more concerned with the privacy rights of the accused and less concerned with innocent victims .
the bill does not contemplate the collection of DNA until after the accused is convicted .
it is easy for the accused to skip bail and commit another crime .
if further crimes are committed the chance of linking the crimes becomes a lot more difficult .
in the bill it is rightly an offence to use DNA samples for purposes other than those of the act .
DNA obtained under the Criminal Code provision should not be used for medical research or other purposes not related to solving crime .
opponents of DNA banking should consider the relief it would bring to victims , such as if a rapist is convicted because of DNA based on perhaps charges of breaking and entry arising several years earlier .
the improved certainty that DNA profiles can bring to the justice system is most welcomed .
i am certain the statistics are overwhelming of how many crimes have been solved using fingerprint evidence .
there was a a long process to advance the technical and ethical context of fingerprinting .
need we go through the same things with DNA ?
simply put , a DNA sample should be collected from all persons accused of serious crimes in the same way that fingerprints are collected .
although the technical capacity is somewhat different , the ethical and legal issues are basically the same .
the DNA profile should then remain on file for a indeterminate amount of time .
if the accused is released from all charges , it should be his or her responsibility to appeal to have the record removed .
why make a distinction between fingerprints and DNA profiles ?
let us get on with it and have basically the same rules for DNA as there are for fingerprints .
it took decades to sort out fingerprinting and taking breath samples for drunk driving .
a lot of unnecessary pain and death occurred while lawyers resisted , argued , game played and ignored the public interest .
DNA not need go down the same winding road .
the Reform Party supports amending the Criminal Code so that police can , on the basis of probable cause , demand DNA samples from suspects of serious crime .
the government has created a very convoluted bill that will not technically work very well and all the permutations and the mistakes will eventually be revealed in the application .
it is likely that Parliament will have to come back and fix the bill .
the technocrats , of course , are understandably proud of their work and they will defend it .
the real problem is the lack of political leadership and resolve from the Liberal cabinet .
in conclusion , we can learn from the past so that we can boldly go forward .
the community expects no less .
i am pleased that the government has finally addressed the topic of DNA .
however , I had hoped for a much bolder approach .
i have confidence that we have the legal talent in Canada to write a simple , ironclad law that works and appropriately balances individual and community concerns .
i urge the government to have more resolve to respond to crime .
may we work together to make Canada a safer place to live .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I speak today with regard to the DNA databank that is being proposed .
today the Reform Party is proposing to make the bill more effective .
the Reform Party was in favour of this before the election and even offered to fast track this bill before the election because Reform members saw it having significant importance in being able to identify criminals .
since the bill did not pass and is now before us today in the new session , we would like to make some amendments to it .
we believe it can be more effective .
i will touch on three areas to identify them .
this is not as much an issue of personal privacy as it is of victims ' rights .
i repeat , the innocent will applaud these changes , the guilty will oppose them .
obviously DNA identification will be a valuable tool for eliminating a suspect if innocent .
that is where the personal privacy aspects are negated .
from what we know , DNA is probably the best way of eliminating somebody as a suspect of a crime .
in the case of public safety , DNA identification is the most effective way of providing persuasive evidence of guilt .
we support the idea of creating a databank for this .
if these changes are made , that is taking samples from all of the accused , requiring samples in all indictable offences and retaining these samples , we ameliorate or lessen the concern about people skipping bail in cases where they know they are guilty , where they suspect they may be found to be guilty so they try to quash their being subject to a DNA analysis which would occur during the case ' s proceedings .
for the sake of justice we do not want to see that happen .
that is why we believe it is important that these samples be retained .
if people are charged these records will be put on the registry , not only if they are convicted .
if the specific charge collapses then a person ' s links to other crimes will not be revealed by taking the DNA sample at the time the charge is laid .
as a result , it is important to keep a permanent register , that this be done not only in the case of a conviction but also in the case of somebody being charged .
the question on which many people focus is how many murderers and sex offenders have been allowed to remain out on our streets because this bill was not passed when it should have been .
the Reform Party wanted to pass this bill before the last election .
we support the bill but we would like to see it being more meaningful .
we would like to see some slight changes made to the bill so it can have broader implications , and accomplish more of what it aims to do so that it can meet a broader definition in terms of its goals and objectives .
i will summarize by going over some of the three provisions we would like to see in the bill .
first , samples should be taken from all of the accused .
second , that samples be required for all indictable offences .
third , that samples and analysis be retained rather than destroyed .
with these changes the Reform Party would wholeheartedly support the idea of a DNA databank .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to rise also in this debate on DNA identification .
i have to point out just how long it has taken the Liberals to start providing our police officers with more of the technological tools , such as DNA evidence , required to protect Canadians from criminals .
once again , and this is so typical of the Liberal approach to crime control , the Liberals are more interested in protecting the rights of criminals than the victims of crime .
let me point out the sections in Bill C - 3 that place handcuffs on the police when the government instead should be making it easier for our law enforcement officials to protect Canadians .
however , Bill C - 3 will allow DNA samples to be taken only from those convicted of , not just charged , with offences .
considering this , a person charged with robbery could also be wanted for rape but DNA samples cannot be collected with the Liberals ' bill until after the person is convicted of robbery .
therefore some of these designated offences , like robbery , arson , torture and causing death by criminal negligence , only allow DNA to be collected by court order when with fingerprints it is automatic .
no , designating offences for court order only DNA is only going to give more jobs to the lawyers and the courts , presumably all Liberal friends at the bar .
the rationale of this section is to protect the privacy rights of criminals and the accused .
will Canadians really be outraged if DNA is instead stored and then later used to convict a rapist who was convicted of robbery several years earlier ?
whose privacy rights are more important to the Liberals , the privacy rights of the rapist or the privacy rights of the victim of the rape ?
continuing on , though , allow me to illustrate a fourth problem with Bill C - 3 .
i would like to ask the Liberal government why is it that its proposed DNA identification act was not part of the first phase of its DNA legislation in 1995 at which time it allowed the police to get warrants to take DNA samples from suspects .
more than two years have gone by since this first phase and in all this time I have to ask how many criminals could have been put behind bars while the Liberals were waiting on introducing a DNA bank .
this procedure no doubt is proposed because of the Liberals ' reluctance to give the bill the level of debate it deserves .
in other words , the Liberals do not want Reform to point out the bill ' s many flaws .
this is a bill that needs to be debated in the House .
referring it to committee so soon is an obvious delaying tactic to prevent Canadians from seeing just how much it panders to criminals and ignores victim rights .
today more than ever we have evidence of the need for a national victims bill of rights that will restore a balance within the criminal justice system by placing the rights of victims above the rights of criminals .
all these points about the DNA identification act and its preoccupation on the criminal ' s versus the victim ' s rights lead me to the inescapable conclusion about the Liberal government ' s views of criminals and ordinary Canadians .
a criminal is someone to be protected , to have all the rights under the stars , sun and moon , to be set free in most cases but , if detention is necessary , to be given a nice comfortable jail cell with cable TV and all the new channels , along with conjugal visits , good home cooking and parole in a couple of months .
it is clear that Liberals do not want the bad guys in jail , but if they are forced to put them in jail they want them to enjoy their stay .
a law abiding Canadian to the Liberals is simply someone whose rights become secondary to criminals in our society .
bill C - 3 reinforces this unacceptable Liberal philosophy toward crime .
it does not do enough for victims of crime and it does not do enough to help the police in their job of ensuring our communities are safe places to live .
i endorse the concept of a DNA bank .
it is necessary to be able to identify criminals positively and it is important for us to be able to correctly exonerate the innocent and to make certain the guilty are proven to be guilty and are punished for their crimes .
this is the only way we will be able to restore true justice to our justice system .
Mr. Jim Pankiw ( Saskatoon - Humboldt , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the technology of DNA is available to us .
it is probably the most accurate means of being able to identify one human being from another since everyone ' s DNA code is different .
some people have closer matches than others , but technology has advanced to the point where science can definitely differentiate every human being in the world from one another .
i do not understand the reluctance of anyone to applying the technology available to us in the enforcement of our justice system .
if someone is arrested and charged with a crime , I do not see why we would not have that person submit to a DNA test and compare it to our DNA databank .
it just seems that it would be in the best interests of our entire society to take advantage of this technology and use it in that respect .
with respect to destroying samples , as I said , if a person has been exonerated and the samples are destroyed there would be no harm done to the person who was falsely accused of a crime .
i was reading through the act and section 2 ( 1 ) states :
the following persons may be fingerprinted or photographed or subjected to such other measurements , processes and operations having the object of identifying persons as are approved by order of the Governor in Council :
( a ) any person who is in lawful custody charged with or convicted of
( i ) an indictable offence , other than an offence that is designed as a contravention under the Contraventions Act in respect of which the Attorney General , within the meaning of that Act , has made an election under section 50 of that Act , or
( ii ) an offence under the Official Secrets Act ;
( b ) any person who has been apprehended under the Extradition Act or the Fugitive Offenders Act ; or
( c ) any person alleged to have committed an indictable offence , other than an offence that is designated as a contravention under the Contraventions Act in respect of which the Attorney General , within the meaning of that Act , has made an election under section 50 of that Act , who is required pursuant to subsection 501 ( 3 ) or 509 ( 5 ) of the Criminal Code to appear for the purposes of this Act by an appearance notice , promise to appear , recognizance or summons .
i guess it all comes back to my original point , which was that there would be no reason not to take samples upon a person ' s being charged with a crime , running them through the databank system , which would ultimately determine whether that person is to be convicted .
we should look at the greater good to the Canadian public and the assistance it would give our law enforcement officers .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will keep my remarks quite brief .
i have always admired the Reform Party in its aspects on various legislation , including gun control , victims rights , et cetera .
it should be also commended for its efforts to keep our streets safe .
however , I have a couple of concerns for which I do not yet have answers .
i was hoping that I could get the answers in the debate today for our party and for our constituents .
the fear I have the most is that in some countries which are not as democratic as ours there is the assumption of guilt before innocence .
thank goodness we live in a society where a person is innocent until proven guilty either by a judge or jury of their peers .
there is one aspect I have not heard from the Reform Party .
as well , we heard members of the Reform Party talk about criminals and the length of time they should stay in jail and the treatment they should receive while incarcerated .
i would have a question for them .
what rehabilitation processes would they have in place while the person is incarcerated ?
what kind of halfway programs would they include in their summations of a prisoner once the person has served their time to rehabilitate them back into society ?
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak to the bill today , an act to provide for the establishment of a national DNA databank .
the way to approach the topic is by clearly determining the obligation of the government when it comes to dealing with people charged with offences , people who commit offences and break the law .
the government has a responsibility in the area of public safety to do everything possible to ensure that families , communities and streets are safe places .
while there are those who will argue the government has gone too far in its policing of our citizens , communities and neighbourhoods , a huge majority of Canadians do not believe the government has gone far enough in areas of providing policing and of giving municipal , city or regional police enough tools to fight crime .
the government has not gone far enough in its commitment that victims of crime should be the number one priority of the criminal justice system .
that is fact .
with regard to DNA testing no one in the country of any consequence in numbers has a problem with fingerprinting .
fingerprinting is an automatic act when one is charged with most crimes .
it helps police forces to identify the person who has been arrested .
it enables them to check the records to see whether the person is wanted on any outstanding warrants in another part of the country .
it allows them to check the fingerprints against the record of fingerprints that may have been found at another crime scene .
it serves as a very effective and useful tool in fighting crime .
the bill does not go far enough .
i will speaker about that later .
it is trying to take that identification tool one step further .
it is a huge step forward in determining the absolute innocence or guilt of people charged with crimes .
it works both ways .
Mr. Speaker , you are a person who appreciates the country and the safety of our communities .
you regard the safety of communities as a number one priority .
i am certain you cannot disagree , as members of the government cannot , that police forces should be given every tool they need to catch the bad guys .
that is what we want to do here .
we want to catch the bad guys , the people who are committing crimes .
we want to ensure that somebody who has been picked up on a lesser charge of robbery , for example , is identified upon arrest while awaiting trial .
if the DNA identification of the person indicates that there is a DNA match in a more serious crime such as rape , assault or murder three or four years prior , the person is identified when arrested on a subsequent robbery charge , for example , if they were not caught the first time .
the last thing we would want to do is grant bail to a person arrested on a robbery charge , knowing that the police may be getting closer to solving a previous more serious crime and knowing the person could not identified because of no DNA testing .
if the person skips out on bail it eliminates getting caught .
we have to be careful of that .
i do not think it is too much to ask for the bill to become more encompassing as far as identification is concerned .
i see no problem with an amendment to the bill that would include the taking of DNA samples in the same manner as we take fingerprints .
if the person were found not guilty , in answer to the NDP member , the DNA sample would be treated the same way as fingerprints when there is a request to have them destroyed .
no one would deny that .
the bill provides automatic samples for a very primary list such as murder , sexual assault , et cetera .
it requires application to court for a secondary list of what the writers of the bill and the Liberals could call less serious crimes .
we should amend the bill to include all people arrested for indictable offences .
at the time they are arrested , DNA samples could be taken and used in the same way as fingerprints so that the cross - checking and identification can take place .
we should amend the bill to cover this aspect of police work .
if we do not do so we would be missing a huge opportunity .
it is the time to do it .
it is before the House now .
we should amend the bill to give it the teeth it deserves .
it should be amended so that police forces are given the tools they need to do the job .
all of us want to see the safety of families , communities and the country as a high priority .
it is our obligation as parliamentarians to ensure that community safety is foremost in the criminal justice system .
Mr. Dale Johnston ( Wetaskiwin , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a privilege to speak on the bill today .
we should reflect back to 1995 at which time there was no process in place to collect the necessary material for a DNA sample .
i was in the House the day the member for Wild Rose challenged the Minister of Justice to bring forth a bill to allow for the collection of DNA samples .
it was pertinent to an upcoming case in which the DNA samples would have a large bearing on the guilt or innocence of the person involved .
to the commendation of the government , it acted quickly .
it brought in a bill .
we debated it in the House .
it was passed so that now there is a process in place through which DNA samples can be collected .
prior to that there was no procedure .
certainly it is a step forward but whenever we consider this type of legislation we have to think about the balance between the rights of the individual and the rights of the accused to privacy and the rights of the public to be protected and to enjoy a law - abiding society , or at least a society that takes action when people do not abide by the law .
while there may be some concern that this is an intrusion into one ' s personal life , perhaps a check stop is also an intrusion .
i suppose a true libertarian would say that is an infringement on the rights of the driving public .
we always have to weigh whether or not we have to give up some of our so - called rights to make society acceptable for all .
at the time when we were talking about the legality of breathalyser tests in Canada there were people who said that taking a blood sample was an intrusion into the personal rights of the accused .
the breathalyser test was developed as a result of that balancing act .
what we are proposing as an amendment is a balancing act between individual rights and collective rights of society .
some concerns have been raised with regard to what will happen to the collected DNA provided the accused is acquitted .
those details certainly could be worked out .
the DNA information should be kept with the local establishment , the arresting body in whatever town , city , village , or wherever the arrest takes place .
that could be easily accommodated in the bill .
it would speak volumes to people who are libertarians and who set their personal freedoms ahead of all other freedoms .
i am reminded of one of my father ' s quotes when he said that democracy and freedom were all about being able to do whatever it is that one wanted to do provided it did not interfere with the rights of others .
that sums it up quite nicely .
when one interferes with the rights of others or when one ' s actions causes the rights of others to be lessened or infringed upon , these kinds of consequences have to take place .
i stress the balancing aspect of the legislation .
it is of utmost importance .
the question of whether or not the DNA material , evidence or analysis will be widely or locally distributed can be very easily dealt with in the legislation .
i am pleased to hear it being raised as a concern because of the possibility of having it included in the legislation .
it is of utmost importance .
we must also not assume that DNA evidence is there only to convict .
we all know of cases in which people have been accused and convicted on circumstantial evidence and where DNA evidence has ultimately proven their innocence .
this can be viewed from both sides .
we should not automatically assume this is a convicting tool .
it is also a tool that will determine innocence .
it is very much along the lines of the breathalyser test , a commonplace test for sobriety .
i am very pleased to see the Reform Party has put forth these amendments and that the government has at last come forth with the legislation and has allowed us to debate it here today .
in my opinion this debate is excellent .
my hope is that the government is willing and ready to accept the Reform amendments .
i am a little disappointed that the government is not here to share its rationale behind this legislation .
i would very much like to hear how it views the privacy aspect and the public need aspect .
i know the government is monitoring what is going on in here now .
i would certainly like it to put forth somebody from the justice department to enlighten us a little more on their thoughts on this matter .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to give credit to members of my party in the justice portfolio who have done an outstanding job to bring forth this issue not only in this Parliament but also in the last Parliament .
it is something we find very difficult to disagree with because it does so much good not only in apprehending the guilty in our society but also in ensuring that false convictions do not occur .
it helps the innocent and it helps society to prosecute the guilty .
it is a shame and the government should be embarrassed that in the last Parliament it did not take the initiative with this tool that can be so effective in helping the police do their job .
heaven knows they have such a difficult time already .
in many cases their hands are tied behind their backs by bureaucratic entanglements and rules and regulations which prevent them from apprehending the guilty .
bill C - 3 and the amendments we put forward can help the police and can help society in building stronger and safer communities .
this bill is a disappointment .
the government has taken a very simple and good concept and has complicated it .
it has not dealt with the issue in a meaningful way .
it has once again merely nibbled around the edges .
that is why my colleagues in the Reform Party in the justice portfolio have been forced to put forth amendments to toughen up the bill .
they do not come merely from us .
they come from police officers and the public who are very knowledgeable about this issue .
they have put forth constructive solutions to make Bill C - 3 an effective tool and an effective weapon in defeating crime .
there are many aspects that must be included in the bill .
the issue of how the national data bank will assist the police and the courts is very important .
we have to ensure the data bank will be applied to individuals who will be convicted in the future and to individuals who have been convicted in the past .
individuals such as Paul Bernardo and Clifford Olson should have their DNA taken and put in this bank .
it makes eminent sense .
i cannot think of an intelligent reason why the government would oppose that other than on purely philosophical grounds .
philosophical grounds do not make our country safe .
they are important but we cannot lose sight of the fact that our objective is to make our country stronger and safer .
it does not mean that we need to trample on the rights of anybody .
an innocent person would have absolutely no compunction whatsoever about having DNA extracted and put into the bank in order to be exonerated from a criminal act .
that is important .
if guilty of course the person would be afraid and would put up any number of roadblocks to prevent that from happening .
it is very important that this bill be applied retroactively to individuals now in jail who have committed serious offences .
why I am not sure .
perhaps only the justice minister knows the answer .
what we want to do for the sake of the Canadian public is to ensure that the DNA data bank would be applied to every person convicted of a serious indictable offence in Canada .
the government cannot argue this .
it is irresponsible not to apply this to all serious offences .
the other point we would like talk about is to ensure that the DNA samples and data are going to be taken properly and that access is going to be only for forensic purposes .
this data bank must be treated with that respect .
other aspects we would like to bring up include the fact that this bill and the precursors to it have been employed in a number of countries around the world .
great Britain , many states in the United States , and a number of European countries have all brought forward their own DNA data banks and they have been very effective .
they have been effective not only in apprehending the guilty but also in exonerating the innocent .
it is also important that the samples and data be kept for a number of reasons .
one is to ensure that the innocent are not convicted .
also , a person who commits a violent crime today could easily commit a violent crime at some time in the future .
a convicted person who spends 10 years in jail for a serious offence and is let out unfortunately sometimes will continue to commit serious and violent offences .
we must have that data because it would enable us to make a rapid intervention and a rapid apprehension .
one of the amendments we are putting forward is to ask the government to please ensure that this good and valuable data is not tossed away .
i would like to talk about an important issue the government has failed to do .
the Reform Party caucus has continued to try to impress upon the government the need to not only apply its funds to apprehending the guilty but also to apply funds to crime prevention .
the government has had one mandate and has failed to introduce into this House any effective measures to prevent crime .
in this country , crime is on the increase .
the government likes to put forth information saying it is on the decrease and some statistics do show that .
but when we peer beyond those statistics , what do we find ?
we find that only 28 % of violent offences in this country were actually reported to the police .
sixty - eight per cent of other violent victimizations were never reported to the police .
this extends beyond violent interventions into other serious interventions too .
the Canadian public is having a crisis of conscience with respect to the justice system .
it is not that they have a lack of faith in the police officers , the men and women who work very hard and put their lives on the line day in and day out , 24 hours a day , 365 days of the year .
it is because the justice system impedes and impairs the police officers from doing their job .
we in the Reform Party have repeatedly and continually put forth constructive , pragmatic and effective legislation that this government could have adopted to try to address the serious problem of crime that we have in our country .
the government has also failed to address the Young Offenders Act .
we have put forth interventions on that .
there is much that we have done in our party on crime prevention and the government has failed to grasp it .
we cannot simply do what we have been doing .
it is more than twice as much as what we spend on employment insurance .
we cannot continue to do it , not from human terms nor economic terms .
i implore the government to really address this problem , get to the heart of it .
engage in the punitive actions that will keep our country safe but also address in the long range measures that we can implement in a very pragmatic way to prevent crime , to address crime in its early nascent period during the first eight years of life .
the government should introduce programs that are going to address and deal with those issues .
if we do that it will help people not only in human terms but also in cold hard dollars and cents .
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , many of the speakers this afternoon have addressed some of the subtleties of this bill and some of the checks and balances that are inherent in the bill and the amendments on the part of the Reform Party .
this afternoon I would like to speak to the heart of this bill and the original intention that was put forward and why we are actually considering this in the first place .
in the day and age we live in there are a great number of technological advances and scientific developments .
it is good that there has been some recognition of the priority of using these advancements in the area of justice and protection of our society .
it is a step in the right direction .
my concern is that it is a step that may not be as effective as it could be .
that is why many of my colleagues have put forward the amendments we have here today .
to put it in common terms , it is kind of like buying a saw without the blade , or a car without the tires , or a hammer without the nails .
it has some good intent to it but it does not go far enough .
no , we have to layer on a new extensive bureaucracy that is going to limit the effectiveness of this technology , limit the effectiveness that our law enforcement agencies will have in applying this technology to protect our citizens .
it is a step in the wrong direction .
we could use the systems already in place to administer this technology .
i would also like to speak to the importance of this House and all the members here in recognizing the very difficult job our police forces have , people who are willing to risk their lives day in and day out to protect citizens .
often they are frustrated with the bureaucratic morass they are faced with when they attempt to bring criminals to justice .
to their credit they continue to do the best they can and are constantly looking in our direction for help from this House to equip them with tools that will make them more effective in their job .
my concern is for those men and women who have chosen as their life career the protection of our society .
today we have an opportunity to give them a tool that will make them that much more effective and that much more fulfilled in their calling , yet we only go halfway .
that is my concern .
there is another component to this as well besides those who protect our society .
what about the victims ?
if this technology and applying it the right way can protect one life or prevent one assault that leaves that person scarred for life , that is justification enough to implement it in a way similar to the way we do fingerprints , to not only record who the criminal is but potentially stop that criminal from performing that act in the first place .
it is tragic that we only go halfway and do not give the justice agencies the ability to implement this to the full .
we have also seen in Canada recently a number of judgments that have years later proven to be incorrect .
had we had this technology at the time and the ability to apply it , those people would not have been incarcerated innocently for many years and guilty parties would not have gone free .
that is justification enough .
we must implement this measure fully , not the halfway measure we see here today .
we must endorse legislation that would allow our law keepers and those involved in that line of work to do the job to the fullest .
it is too bad that this is only a halfway measure .
i repeat as I close here today that it is no good to have half of the tool and not the whole tool to do the job .
it is like a power saw without the blade .
that is what we have here today .
i know that my constituents would rather have seen this legislation go to the point where our law keepers can use it effectively day in and day out to protect them and keep the criminals off the streets .
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , what a great piece of legislation .
finally we have movement toward becoming a little more accurate in identifying the people who are committing criminal acts .
i think that is terrific .
it is about time we moved in this direction .
this DNA databank is a great new technology .
it is a great way of providing identification positively and clearly .
it is the best we have .
we should look at this and ask ourselves why it is that there is any hesitation whatsoever in applying it wherever it needs to be applied so that we can find those people who actually are the ones in question here .
there should not even be a question about something like this .
is there any doubt at all that we want to come to grips with the criminal element in our society ?
let ' s face it .
the people of Canada are looking to the government , any government , and saying that it is their job to provide for their peace , their protection , their safety and their property .
that is the job .
that is what the justice system is supposed to do .
we know that this technology works .
in fact we have the case of Guy Paul Morin who today is free because this technology made it very clear what was really the truth .
therefore , the question we are facing here today concerns itself with a new technology that has been proven to be more effective , that has proven to be more desirable , one that has the complete confidence of our law enforcement officers , one that has been accepted by the judges in our courts .
we have before us now a bill that goes part way in accepting such a technology .
it is almost like saying that there are 26 letters in the alphabet but for now we will just use the first 13 and hope that the language will work .
it will not work .
things cannot be done like that .
this legislation has to do with three things : responsibility , truth and trust .
what is the area of responsibility we are talking about ?
i have already alluded to the number one responsibility , that which the government is to provide for the peace and security of its people and for the protection of their property .
it should do this in a peaceful environment , an environment where people can be happy , where they can love and have relationships with other people , where they can develop friendships , where they can trust their neighbours and where they can say " I am responsible '' .
they must do this the best way they can .
they are the peacekeepers and therefore responsible for we want in our society .
it is the responsibility of government to give them the tools that will make it easy for them to do the job they have been charged to do .
why would we think of tying their hands and saying they cannot use this particular technology that has been proven to be so effective ?
it seems shortsighted and devoid of responsibility .
surely one of our major responsibilities is to give to these officers the best possible tools with which to enforce the laws .
in the final analysis this should be an adult bill , a bill that realizes full responsibility and not part of it .
the second aspect this bill should deal with is the question of truth .
if they happen to believe the truth , they will act on something that is truthful .
they could also believe something that is not true .
that belief will still influence their actions but their actions will be false and will be based on something that takes them in directions in which they do not want to go and in which society does not want them to go .
in the case of Guy Paul Morin , the police believed this man had committed a crime .
the truth was he had not but their actions were determined by what they believed .
he was charged .
the court looked at the situation , believed he had done this and put him in jail .
they convicted him .
they then discovered that the truth was elsewhere and what they had believed was in fact not the truth .
a way had to be found to identify what the truth was .
they did find it and this man was finally declared innocent .
it is wonderful that at least part of his life has been rejuvenated and he is back in society , making a contribution both to his family and to the community in which he lives .
this bill ought to be expanded so we can find the truth that exists in all these cases .
not only should we be responsible but we also need to find the truth in the best way we possibly can .
the third area is the area of trust .
i found it very interesting that one of the arguments used for not using this DNA bank is because it might be used for the wrong purposes .
that has to do with trust .
i do not know of a single RCMP officer who does not have access to a gun .
that gun can be used for any one of a variety of purposes .
we trust that police officer to use the gun in the way it was intended to be used .
that is a matter of trust .
that is a matter of responsibility .
that is a matter of truth .
this lady or gentlemen with the gun has said " I will use it in the best interests of society .
i will use it in the most powerful way I know how and in the most effective way I know how to enforce the law '' .
we trust police officers with a gun .
it is a lethal weapon that can maim and destroy lives , yet we trust them with that weapon .
now we come to a DNA databank which is to be given to a very specific group of people who know exactly what the guidelines and the conditions are .
then we say that we cannot trust these people .
that is an insult to the people who use their best abilities to enforce the law the way it should be enforced .
this is a very effective , precise tool .
that tool should be given to them and we should trust the people to use it in the way in which it was intended .
to think that we can never get around to the business of trusting , that we would say " Unless we can trust you , we are not going to give you anything . "
we have to trust them .
surely something that is known to be this effective can be given to people and surely we can trust them to use it in a manner in which it was intended .
in conclusion , this is an instrument for people to help people and for the government to exercise its true responsibility to do what it was elected to do , look after the safety and security of Canadians and protect the property of individuals .
we should expand this , not contract it .
Mr. Chuck Cadman ( Surrey North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to make a few comments and add my support to the bill , although I do it reluctantly because I feel it is something that should go a lot further .
the whole concept of only being able to take a DNA sample when a person is convicted does not help in the police investigation of a case .
in my home province of British Columbia more than 300 murders are unsolved .
in many of these cases the police feel that if they had been able to get DNA samples and DNA evidence they could solve a huge number of these .
large numbers of victims of crime are wandering around B.C. knowing who the killers are , but are unable to get any conviction because lack of DNA support .
the whole concept of a DNA databank has been a long time coming .
however , it is a good beginning but more has to be done to give police the tools they need to do the job .
they have to be able to take DNA samples at the time of arrest to aid in the investigation .
they should be treated like fingerprint evidence and destroyed only on request at the time of an acquittal in the case .
again , I add my support .
i am sure that all victims ' organizations across the country support this kind of legislation .
however , it something we have to take a lot further and more work has to be done .
but it is a very good starting point .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
some hon. members :
No.
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea .
some hon. members :
yea .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
all those opposed will please say nay .
some hon. members :
nay .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
in my opinion the yeas have it .
and more than five members having risen :
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
call in the members .
the vote on the motion stands deferred until the end of Government Orders tomorrow , Tuesday , November 4 , 1997 .
it being 2 p.m. we will now proceed to statements by members .
statements BY MEMBERS
sickle CELL DISEASE
Ms. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise to inform the House about sickle cell disease .
the lifespan of a person with sickle cell varies .
members of our community who are afflicted with the disease experience physical , emotional and social effects of the disease .
extensive research and funding are limited on sickle cell .
there is a need for resources to help health care professionals provide appropriate treatment .
on behalf of my constituents and other Canadians who are afflicted with sickle cell , I call for greater government funding and research for this disease .
i applaud the Sickle Cell Association of Ontario , the Sick Children ' s Hospital and the Scarborough General Hospital for their efforts in ensuring that this disease is understood .

justice
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on behalf of the constituents of Okanagan - Coquihalla .
they are fuming at the recent sentence of convicted rapist Donald Poslowski of Princeton , B.C.
Poslowski was convicted of the brutal rape and strangulation of a 9 year old girl .
the sentence ?
six years with the possibility of parole in just two .
the judge had the opportunity to give him a life sentence and instead determined that six years would be sufficient .
who is worse , the rapist who commits the crime or the judge who condones it ?
i applaud the community of Princeton which is fighting to appeal this absurd sentence .
Canadians want a criminal justice system that offers true justice for victims in sentencing , a system that acts as a deterrent to potential violent offenders , a system that does not allow violent offenders the opportunity for early parole .
your honour , on the count of failing to provide safe playgrounds , homes and streets , we find this Liberal government guilty .

youth EMPLOYMENT
Mr. Dan McTeague ( Pickering - Ajax - Uxbridge , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to take this opportunity to recognize Canada career week 1997 and to congratulate the week ' s organizers for highlighting the necessity of preparing young Canadians for opportunities in the new knowledge based economy .
choosing a career path has always been a serious decision for any generation of young people .
carving out a new career path in the information society is especially challenging and that is why the Government of Canada has made youth employment a national priority .
one key goal of our youth employment strategy is to provide young people with the information and assistance they need to be informed about their career choices .
the Government of Canada is proud to be a partner and active promoter of Canada Career Week .
we are committed to seeing that young people are made aware of the challenging career opportunities in the new economy and , if necessary , to draw up the career plan that will prepare them for the world of work .
career week offers an important opportunity to -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Malpeque .

Mr. Wayne Easter ( Malpeque , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am most pleased to offer congratulations to Mr. Lloyd Lockerby who last week was inducted into the Atlantic Agricultural Hall of Fame .
born in Hamilton , P.E.I. , Lloyd attended Prince of Wales College , graduated from MacDonald College in 1938 and received the governor general ' s medal for top standing .
he was employed as an agricultural representative with the provincial department of agriculture and returned full time to the family farm in 1943 .
Lloyd ' s successful prize winning beef operation consistently wins top placings at provincial , regional and national shows .
his fox herd breeding stock , shipped worldwide , has become internationally known for its superior quality .
Lloyd ' s commitment to his community has been long and admirable .
he served as leader of 4 - H for 21 years , as president of Kensington Co - op , director of Amalgamated Dairies , as well as on several provincial boards .
my heartiest congratulations to Lloyd , his wife Jean and their family .

parish OF SAINTE - MONIQUE - LES - SAULES
Mr. Jean - Paul Marchand ( Qu 茅 bec East , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wish to congratulate the organizing committee of the 50 th anniversary celebrations of the parish of Sainte - Monique - les - Saules .
the activities it organized were a resounding success throughout the year .
its efforts were rewarded by the strong participation of parish residents , and its members ' enthusiasm was reflected in the quantity and quality of the events organized .
i would particularly like to thank the chairman of the committee , Lucien Lemieux , the parish priest , Gervais Dallaire , and all 11 members of the organizing committee .
all gave generously of their time to the community .
through their commitment , they are helping to strengthen the important ties among people in Les Saules .
once again , thank you to all those who contributed , in whatever way they could , to the success of the 50 th anniversary celebrations of the Sainte - Monique - les - Saules parish .

KELOWNA TOY RUN
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , 200 motorcycles riding through the streets of a city makes citizens wary , but in Kelowna the sound of engines revving is greeted with enthusiasm because it means every child will receive a gift this Christmas .
on behalf of the constituents of Kelowna , I give many thanks to Tom Maxted , this year ' s organizer , and the many people who help the Kelowna toy run get bigger and better every year .

veterans
Mrs. Rose - Marie Ur ( Lambton - Kent - Middlesex , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , veterans week is a time of national celebration and commemoration of those who served and continue to serve in our military services .
many who will attend next Tuesday ' s Remembrance Day services will be the widows , the children and grandchildren of veterans who never came home from the battlefield .
as we pay tribute to those who sacrificed so much on the front lines , we must also remember that war does not affect only those who fought but also those who were left behind .
on the home front it was often the women who took up the slack , who worked on the farms and in the factories , raised families and kept the home fires burning .
it was the children who never saw their fathers and grandfathers who also paid dearly for the sacrifice .
so we learn the lesson that no one can escape the tragic consequences of war .
the sacrifices of those who went before either on the front lines or back at home must never be forgotten .
* * *
Mrs. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , today the governor general will be naming the national entrepreneur of the year .
Mr. Klaus Woerner , the president of ATS , a firm in my riding of Kitchener Centre , has been designated as one of the finalists for this national award .
beginning in a small shop with only two other employees in 1978 , Mr. Woerner ' s business has expanded to employ over 2,500 employees with operations in three continents and sales in all .
Mr. Woerner ' s success mirrors that of many business persons in the Waterloo region , one of the most dynamic economic regions in Canada .
the award presented today also reflects the tremendous achievements of the Canadian economy in the past four years .
the future promises to be even brighter yet .

st - FRAN 脟 OIS - DE - SALES PARISH CHURCH
Mrs. Maud Debien ( Laval East , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , this year we are celebrating the 150 th anniversary of the building of the oldest church in Laval , the church of the parish of St - Fran 莽 ois - de - Sales .
this magnificent example of Laval ' s heritage is located in the riding of Laval East .
through its relics and architecture , it stands as a tribute to the talents , creativity and aesthetic sense of Quebec craftsmen and artists .
the church of St - Fran 莽 ois - de - Sales is also a symbol of the sense of belonging to a community , to values of faith , sharing , solidarity and openness to one another .
it is a tangible sign of the ties woven over time by its parish community , to whom I wish to pay tribute today .
it is also , without a doubt , a reflection of our culture and history , and one of the symbols of the enduring nature of the people of Quebec .

commission DE TOPONYMIE DU QU 脡 BEC
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , controversy still rages over the naming of 101 islands in the far north of Quebec . On the one side , the Cree and Inuit communities feel that they were not consulted before the names inspired by Quebec literature were chosen , and on the other the Commission de toponymie du Qu 茅 bec persists in stating that , in its opinion , this was " virgin and unnamed territory '' .
Matthew Coon Come , Chief of the Grand Council of the Crees , and Zebedee Nungak are deeply disappointed by the geographical names commission ' s giving the 101 islands a name and claiming not to have known that there was already an aboriginal name for these geographical features .
this is one more example of the separatist government ' s preference for its own partisan agenda over consultation with its fellow citizens in northern Quebec .

foreign POLICY
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the world is poised to sign a land mine treaty in December and Canada has been a leader in this success .
but this is just the beginning .
if we are to work toward a safer world we must address the precursors to conflict and formulate responses to them .
human rights violations , militarization and the breakdown of civil structures all contribute to conflict .
to address these requires multinational responses from NGOs and other institutions .
canada can use its moral suasive power to create a critical mass of like minded nations to truly address these issues .
we must move our foreign policy from an era of conflict management to an era of conflict prevention .
we must seize the day for a better and safer world for all .
* * *
land MINES
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the NDP congratulates the international campaign to ban land mines and the 1,000 NGOs from 60 countries that backed the treaty process .
we also congratulate Mines Action Canada with which we were pleased to work in the last Parliament helping to copy and forward the many letters of support it was generating to all cabinet ministers .
the Canadian government and other governments responded to the work of the NGOs , and that is good .
unfortunately the Americans have not seen fit to sign on .
we hope they and others will yet see the light .
what we need now is a similar but even more comprehensive and successful dynamic to develop around the need to abolish nuclear weapons , which pose a threat to the entire human prospect .
let the recent success on land mines be only the latest but not the last step in banning particular evils from our midst .
* * *
QUEBEC PREMIER
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , look out , look out , Lucien Bouchard is in China .
in 1994 , the sovereignist leader of the Bloc Quebecois stated , in connection with the Canadian mission to China , that our Prime Minister , and I quote " has made a 180 degree turn and set a course that is guided by strictly commercial interests , thereby turning his back on protecting human rights '' .
Lucien Bouchard also asked whether our Prime Minister would " allude to the oppressive policies of this dictatorial regime only in very polite terms and in private , on the - advice of his Minister of Foreign Affairs '' .
today , in 1907 , as part of his own trade mission to China , the same sovereignist leader , but now Premier of Quebec , is planning to use courtesy and respect on this question .
he does not want to see this mission turn into a big problem .
so , who then is telling the truth , Lucien Bouchard , 1994 version , or Lucien Bouchard , 1997 version ?
it seems as if what is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander , where principles are concerned .
will the real Lucien Bouchard please stand up .
i hope that the Bloc Quebecois , 1997 version , thinks the same way as the leader of its head office in Quebec .

the MINER COMPANY
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , today at noon Nobel prize recipient Jody Williams and the prime minister destroyed the last land mine in Canada ' s stockpile .
on this momentous occasion I am disheartened by our government ' s lack of interest in a domestic issue occurring in Shefford , Quebec .
the Miner Company operated as an arms manufacturing plant during World War II in Shefford .
in April 1996 forgotten explosive material was found at the site of the old plant .
the ministers of foreign affairs , defence and the environment as well as the prime minister have all been made aware of this situation in our backyard .
to date no action has been taken to clear the area of dangerous material .
i urge the government to maintain a domestic policy consistent with our international agenda and to address the dangerous situation in Shefford without further delay before a Canadian resident is injured or killed .

land MINES
Ms. Paddy Torsney ( Burlington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , today is a remarkable day in Canadian history et nous pouvons touts 锚 tre fier d '锚 tre Canadiens .
today after three years and the efforts of many individuals , including the member for Brant , Canada has eliminated its land mine stockpile .
this is a critical step in the long road to ban land mines around the world .
in December governments , NGOs , citizens and activists will come together in Ottawa to sign a treaty that will unambiguously ban land mines .
for all the world it will be a wonderful celebration .
it will also be a time to commit energies , to work hard to ensure the treaty is ratified , implemented and monitored .
the remarkable success of individual and collective efforts , the tremendous accomplishments of people like Nobel peace prize winner Jody Williams give us the energy we need to see this issue resolved .
let us join in congratulating Ms. Williams for her relentless quest and in pledging to her our continued support to work together toward a safer society within our borders and outside them for all human beings .

immigration
Mr. Gary Pillitteri ( Niagara Falls , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , there are those in this House who link unemployment with immigration in spite of the fact that several studies have proven them wrong time and time again , but ignorance perseveres .
immigrant success stories which are the norm do not make the front page of national newspapers .
recently I received a letter from a constituent , a refugee to our country and now a proud Canadian citizen .
she wanted me to know that she was gainfully employed , waiting for a place to do her apprenticeship in hairdressing and earning credits toward a high school diploma .
she ended her letter with :
i will try to make you proud and to be a good , honest and valiant citizen , a small part of a large family of Canadians .
i am sure I echo the sentiments of many Canadians when I say to her " Thank you , Hilda , for choosing Canada as your new home '' .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
environment
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , normally the finance minister is one of the more talkative ministers in the House .
that is unacceptable in that the Kyoto deal could cost ordinary families thousands of dollars .
how much is the Kyoto deal going to cost and how are we going to pay for it ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am delighted to respond to the leader of the Reform Party .
this is the first time I have been asked a question by the Reform Party on the issue .
as the environment minister set out very clearly , she has not yet gone to Kyoto .
the negotiations have not been completed .
it is very difficult for one to estimate the final costs of an agreement that has been neither negotiated nor signed .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , we cannot understand first the silence of the minister and now the waffling of the minister .
environmental interest groups are offering their speculation as to what this deal will cost .
the industry interests have offered their speculation .
the think - tanks have offered their calculations , but it is the finance department that will have to actually calculate the cost of positions the minister is taking in Kyoto and how we will pay for it .
i repeat my question .
how much is the Kyoto deal going to cost and how are we going to pay for it ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the leader of the Reform Party has answered his own question .
the finance department does not speculate .
the finance department deals with facts .
it deals with a number of items that will have to be negotiated .
we are in the process of doing that , but we will not speculate , not even to please the leader of the Reform Party .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canadians are looking for answers on the economic implications , the job implications and the tax implications of the positions the environment minister is taking to Kyoto .
the finance department has the capacity to run those numbers .
it can run scenarios on all the options the minister is looking at .
again I ask a question of the finance minister .
is it not his obligation to the House to tell us how much what the environment minister is proposing is going to cost and how we are going to pay for it ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , when the negotiations begin and when the government ' s position is outlined in clear detail then very clearly the costs and the ways of achieving it will be outlined .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
the Liberal minister for Alberta has been as quiet as a little mouse on this , not even a squeak about the Kyoto deal .
the entire oil patch is worried and the Liberals have not ruled out an energy tax .
the minister has not done a thing to calm their fears .
Albertans want to hear finally from their top Liberal .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it certainly is an issue for all Canadians but specifically in the Alberta oil patch .
Albertans themselves are worried about an energy tax .
the countdown to Kyoto is on .
we would think the top Alberta Liberal would have said something by now , but in fact she is hiding and she is hiding in the House .
some hon. members :
order .
the Speaker :
i am sure the whole House is aware that a question generally is posed to the government and anyone on the government ' s side can answer that question at any time they want .
i am going to permit the hon. member to continue with the question .
miss Deborah Grey :
thank you , Mr. Speaker .
i am sure Canadians will be glad of that .
Albertans are wondering where is Waldo .
will the justice minister stand up for her constituents and will she stand up -
the Speaker :
the hon. Minister of the Environment .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this issue is one that the Reform Party will not speak about from an environmental perspective .
we have yet to hear after 50 questions any view of the Reform Party with regard to this as an environmental issue .
many Albertans are doing very serious things to reduce greenhouse gases in that province .
the Reform Party could learn a lot by listening to Albertans .

computer SYSTEMS
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the President of the Treasury Board .
experts agree that passage to the year 2000 will constitute a challenge for business and government alike , since all computer systems will run into the same problem , which will hamper all government operations , including the issuance of cheques .
given the serious threats posed by the arrival of the year 2000 to all computer systems , could the President of the Treasury Board assure us that the government is prepared to meet its obligations , including that of issuing cheques and pension cheques in particular ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are very aware of the problem the arrival of the year 2000 represents for our computer systems .
i have already provided the House with certain details on the action we have taken , the groups looking at the situation - department by department - and the sorts of problems we are facing .
we are doing what we have to so we can , among other things , issue cheques and we are continuing to do what we have to do in the various departments to come to terms with this eventuality .
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I can understand the minister ' s wanting to provide reassurance , but we need to know the truth .
the auditor general is very concerned .
what does the President of the Treasury Board say to the auditor general , who wants departments and agencies to give very high priority to the year 2000 projects and to develop contingency plans ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are in contact with the auditor general on this matter .
he mentioned it in his latest report .
when I made my comments on the report to the auditor general , I indicated that we would consider the matter urgent .
we are ensuring that all departments do likewise .
we have set up a steering committee that will ensure the proper measures are taken in time .
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini 猫 re , BQ ) :
my question is for the President of the Treasury Board .
should the government fail to meet the information technology challenge of the change in millennium , millions of cheques , including pension , old age and EI benefit cheques , will not be issued .
since Human Resources Development Canada took a long time to develop its computer system just to end up , after investing hundreds of millions of dollars in this project , deciding that the solution would be to cast the new system aside , what assurance do we have that a solution will be found by the year 2000 ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the problems my hon. colleagues refer to are real problems that concern us too .
that is why , once again , we have a group of experts at the data centre in charge of monitoring developments , who are currently following every lead received from the private sector and the public sector in other countries on how to deal with the problem created by the advent of the year 2000 .
i can assure my colleague that we are taking all necessary steps to deal with this problem .
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini 猫 re , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , since the year 2000 is 26 months away and that 26 months is a very short time to tackle such a computer challenge , is the President of the Treasury Board prepared to report to Parliament on a regular basis on the progress being made in this respect ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , let me read into the record part of the auditor general ' s report where he states his views on the matter .
it reads as follows :
the Secretariat has been actively raising awareness of Year 2000 across government .
the interdepartmental working group set up and chaired by its project office has provided a forum for discussing views and exchanging experiences in Year 2000 work .
through its surveys , the working group , and other interdepartmental committees involving heads of information technology and deputy ministers , the Secretariat has played a meaningful role in co - ordinating -

goods AND SERVICES TAX
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the finance minister .
last week Nova Scotia ' s premier visited the finance minister seeking relief for the BST burden on essentials like home heating fuel .
the federal government sent the Nova Scotia premier packing empty handed even though a GST reduction would create far more jobs than any other proposed tax break .
why will the finance minister not agree to reduce the BST on family essentials like children ' s clothing , home heating fuel and school supplies and at the same time increase the GST tax credit ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I met with the premier of Nova Scotia last week .
we had an extensive discussion dealing with a great number of issues , all of which are under continued consideration .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
that is progress , Mr. Speaker .
before introducing more tax cuts for the well off , will the minister get in sync with Canadians , remove the GST now on family essentials like children ' s clothing , school supplies and home heating fuel , and grant GST tax relief to those who need it most ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am not quite sure I know what planet the leader of the NDP is on .
in terms of RRSPs the changes we have brought in such as the unlimited carryback are a clear benefit to low and to medium income Canadians .
at the same time the member should take a look at other tax changes from my colleague in human resources , the child tax benefit and the changes we have brought in for students , for parents who are saving for their students ' education , and the changes we have brought in for the physically disabled .
that is precisely what we have done .
i do not know where the leader of the NDP has been but it is clearly not in North America .

national DEFENCE
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , in France , in Great Britain and in the United States , there is an inspector general for the armed forces .
an inspector general was required in the case of the Somalia inquiry .
our party ' s electoral platform includes the appointment of an inspector general .
there have been reports showing that drugs were used in a top secret military base and that there was another cover - up by the Department of National Defence .
in view of these facts , why does Canada not appoint an inspector general for the armed forces ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we will have all of those functions in the changes that are being made in the Canadian forces .
we will have a chief of review services and an ombudsman .
just about anything that the Somalia inquiry suggested would come under the role of the inspector general comes under the role of those two people , or one of the other mechanisms , such as the grievance board and the national investigative services of the military police as well .
there are all of these with civilian oversight as well to ensure that Canadians are getting the proper information about a job being done .
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , last week at the defence committee I put forward a motion to hear from the three Somalia commissioners to speak on chapter 44 of their report , " A Need for a Vigilant Parliament '' .
there were reports this weekend of drug use at a top military base and a bungled investigation .
Canadians deserve a military that is proud , effective and capable .
Canadians deserve a military that is accountable to the people .
i ask again , when will the inspector general be a part of Canada ' s defence team ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I do not agree with the preamble about bungling .
let me talk about the fact that we are going to have very substantial civilian oversight with the ombudsman and with many of the other functions that will be performed with respect to the military .
also we will have a great increase in terms of public reporting from the chief of defence staff , the judge advocate general , the provost marshal , the military police complaints commission , the ombudsman and the independent grievance board , all of which will make annual reports which will be available to Parliament for scrutiny .

environment
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are not satisfied with the silence of the senior minister from Alberta on an issue of concern to the -
the Speaker :
my colleagues , as a general rule in question period the question is addressed to the government .
as a more specific rule , if we are going to name ministers , it should be with their administrative responsibility in mind .
in question period we do not know exactly where the question is going until the question is put , but the question itself should go to the administrative responsibility of a member .
i would ask all hon. members in phrasing their questions to keep that in mind .
Mr. Preston Manning :
Mr. Speaker , I could argue that this issue has a legal dimension and therefore might come within the purview of the minister .
this issue more importantly is a balancing issue .
we are trying to balance interests , an economic interest and an environmental interest .
we are trying to balance the interests of different provinces .
this minister is in a position to represent those interests .
my question -
the Speaker :
we are going to pass to the second question .
there was no question on the first pass .
we ran out of time .
i would ask the hon. member for Calgary Southwest to please put his question .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , let the record show that the senior minister from Alberta has nothing to say .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .

deficit REDUCTION
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is to the Minister of Finance .
between 1993 and 1998 , this government will have taken $ 19 billion from the employment insurance fund , $ 11 billion from social transfers to the provinces and $ 5 billion from its employees ' retirement fund .
however , expenditures by departments and crown corporations will have been reduced only by a little more than $ 2 billion .
instead of looting pension funds , the employment insurance fund and provincial social programs , when will the Minister of Finance reduce his spending by really cleaning up his departments ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the member knows very well that there was a two - year gap between our first expenditure reductions and the reductions in transfers to the provinces .
the member knows very well that tax points have to be considered and that the federal cuts have been much deeper than the provincial cuts .
he knows very well also that since we took office , we have reduced employment insurance premiums every year .
he knows also that we have invested a lot of money in research and development , in job creation and in young people and that we will continue to make investments for the future of Canadians .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , that is not the issue .
the issue is that the Minister of Finance has taken $ 35 billion from the pockets of the less privileged and that his own efforts to reduce spending in his own department amount to about $ 2.4 billion .
that is the real issue , and I am using his own figures .
he should answer the question instead of trying to evade it .
my second question is this :
how can the minister say that he has done his job properly when in fact he has confiscated $ 35 billion from the provinces , from the unemployed and from retirement funds , when he himself has only reduced spending by $ 2.4 billion ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the member knows very well that these numbers are completely wrong .
* * *
government SPENDING
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , in a poll released this weekend a majority of Canadians said no to new spending after the budget is balanced , but nearly half said their top priority is to pay down the debt , while a third said it was tax relief .
my question is for the Minister of Finance .
does he agree with Canadians that any future surplus should be directed to debt reduction and tax relief and not to new spending ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
yes , we have made it very clear that we do intend to reduce the debt .
in fact in the last six or seven months we have reduced close to $ 13 billion of marketable debt .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , in the same poll a whole 7 % of Albertans said they want new spending from this government which is planning to spend half of the future surplus on new spending .
in fact more than half of those surveyed said they are worried that this government is going to get us back into a deficit situation again through new spending .
this government promised in the throne speech 29 new spending programs and not a single tax cut .
will the Minister of Finance admit that he has misread public opinion ?
will he agree to give Canadians the tax relief they are demanding today ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we already began to provide tax relief of over $ 2 billion over a three year period in the last budget .
what Canadians have made very clear is that they do not want to see tax cuts paid for by a $ 3 billion reduction in old age pensions which is in the Reform platform , or from a $ 3.5 billion cut to health care which is in the Reform platform .
Canadians do not want to see the social programs of this country gutted and eviscerated by a Reform Party which has no idea of what it is that makes this country work .
* * *
foreign INVESTMENTS
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau ( Repentigny , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is to the Minister for International Trade .
since 1995 , OECD member countries , including Canada , have been negotiating a multilateral agreement on investment , aimed at clarifying the rules governing foreign investments .
can the government assure us that the future agreement will include adequate clauses to prevent countries from lowering their environmental protection and labour standards in the hope of attracting foreign investments ?
hon. Sergio Marchi ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the whole goal of the negotiations for an MAI is to set clear rules , clear regulations and above all , the highest standards possible that will govern both investment into Canada as well as outward investment across the world .
what we want to avoid certainly from our country ' s perspective is that investment flows to the lowest standards in the developing world .
that is why I have been saying that after the OECD we must transfer the whole issue of negotiating a multilateral agreement on investment to the WTO so that we can standardize business in the third world as well .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau ( Repentigny , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , let me try again and see if I can get a clearer answer .
will the government also pledge to ensure that cultural protection measures included in the agreement will be negotiated in a manner satisfactory to Quebec and Canadian cultural groups ?
hon. Sergio Marchi ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thought I made myself crystal clear in the first answer .
i hope the member was listening because we also said many times that as far as culture is concerned , Canadian culture is off the table at the MAI .

national DEFENCE
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , access to information documents reveal the pathetic state of our helicopter fleet .
in the last three years alone there have been 6 accidents , 256 separate incidents , 48 injuries and 2 deaths .
the Labradors and Sea Kings need to be replaced now .
will the minister of defence continue to delay and dance with disaster or will he show that he really does care and announce a delivery date today ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we really do care .
that is why we want to make sure that we get the proper helicopters that are going to meet the operational needs for those fine dedicated men and women who go out and conduct rescues under some very trying circumstances .
we are very close to doing that .
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the minister of defence promised that he would have an announcement before the end of September .
it is now December and there has been no announcement .
it has been four years .
what is the hold - up ?
why can the government not make up its mind on replacing the helicopters ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , one of the problems hon. members opposite have is their research .
they do not even know what month they are in .
we certainly want to make that decision as quickly as possible .

ALGERIA
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
Algeria is sinking into anarchy and chaos , before the eyes of a powerless international community .
is the Canadian government prepared to follow up on that coalition ' s request to establish a commission of inquiry or , contrary to what it is doing in the area of land mines , is it not going to stick its neck out ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I share the hon. member ' s grave concern about the situation in Algeria .
i had several discussions with Algeria ' s foreign affairs officials to inform them of the great concern of Canadians and to develop a program .
i also promised to meet with interested groups , and I hope such meeting will take place soon .
* * *
land MINES
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Brossard - La Prairie , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
we are now one month away from the Ottawa conference on the elimination of land mines .
given the extremely powerful leadership role Canada has taken in this regard , I would like to know what specific measures are being taken , both for the conference itself and in terms of post - conference follow - up ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is very important that we work very hard to get as many countries as possible to come to Ottawa next month .
more than 100 are coming now .
the Prime Minister was able to recruit others last week at the Commonwealth conference .
he will be at the francophone meetings next week , and I am going to the Middle East to undertake a campaign to get more countries to come .
it is also very important to enlist the entire House of Commons and the Senate in trying to ratify the treaty at the same time as we sign it .
that would be a very important signal to the leadership of Canada .
clearly we must begin dedicating serious resources to the implementation of the treaty .
* * *
passports
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , this spring two men were charged with the possession of stolen passports .
this past weekend we had 25 blank passports produced by a secure printer in Ottawa .
does the minister know about this ?
does the minister care about this ?
what is the minister going to do about this ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I know about it because I was the one who informed the security forces that they could start investigating the matter .
i was a little ahead of the hon. member .
he is only about six months late in asking the question .
not only did he not get his research right , he seems to be out of date in his questions .
it is now being investigated actively and the problem will be properly handled by the police authorities .
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the member has had six months to do something about it .
last month he assured us that passport security was going to be taken care of .
now we find passports being used as currency in the drug trade .
how many more of these kinds of scandals must we have before the minister does something about our passports ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I think the hon. member is engaged in a little sleight of hand .
the question we faced last month was the use of forged passports .
it had nothing to do with this incident .
people forged Canadian passports .
on the second issue , when we found out there was a security breach , we asked for an investigation .
the police have it in hand .
we can do no more than make sure those who have undertaken that are properly charged .
* * *
education
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , last week the industry minister warned that companies are leaving Canada because of a shortage of skilled workers , yet the finance minister claims to be doing more for higher education than any other government .
a human resources development department study suggests tuition fees are so high they are deterring potential students .
will the government explain why it is actuality deterring potential students and driving jobs out of the country when it claims to be doing so much for education ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is absolutely wrong .
we are working very hard these days talking with lenders , talking with the provinces , and talking with student associations .
we are well aware of the problem many students have in being able to borrow money .
we are addressing the situation by talking with everyone that has a say in the matter .
we need an accurate and helpful solution , not just this kind of statement that does not make any sense .
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , by the year 2000 , 45 % of new jobs will require 16 years of education , yet a government study shows that since 1980 public transfers for education have been cut in half , from $ 6.44 per each dollar of student fees in 1980 to less than $ 3 in 1995 .
even then the government continued to cut .
how can the government turn its back on young Canadians by cutting the very programs that would lead them to jobs in the future ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is quite the opposite .
if the hon. member would care to take a look at the last budget , he will see that the government brought in substantial measures to help parents save for their children ' s education through RESPs .
at the same time we brought in a whole new system of tax credits to enable students to have either their parents or other people help them pay for their tuition .
we doubled the grace period which students would have to begin to pay back their student loans .
not only did we do that but we brought in a whole series -

taxation
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , during last Parliament ' s debate on Bill C - 92 the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance said that the old system of deduction inclusion was not working for the benefit of Canadian children .
as a result , the Income Tax Act was amended so that child support payments would no longer be deductible for the payee nor be included in the recipient ' s income .
in theory , these changes seem equitable but in practice it translates into smaller amounts awarded by judges .
monetary awards for children are now smaller than what used to be left in the hands of recipients .
could the minister of revenue explain to the House why taking money from poor families affected by divorce is of any benefit to Canadian children ?
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , part of our agenda has been to help children .
part of the whole program to not let deductions happen for parents is to ensure that the children get more money .
this is part of the children agenda we , including the Minister of Justice , have put forward .
we will ensure that the children of Canada are protected through the child poverty program .
we will also ensure that all funds go to children .
is this member saying that for those people who pay maintenance fees , after tax money or before tax money should go toward children ?
he should be clear on what his position is .
Ms. Diane St - Jacques ( Shefford , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the former Minister of Justice told the Senate committee that tax changes provide Ottawa with additional revenue .
this means that the children of divorced parents have less , but the government has more .
can the Minister of National Revenue tell the House how much money divorced families are now giving the Minister of Finance and explain to us how these changes actually help children ?
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to assure the hon. member that the purpose of our reforms and the purpose of the reform entered into by my predecessor was to ensure that children of divorced families get more .
i assure the hon. member that my department is watching very carefully the implementation and application of the guidelines .
if there appear to be any problems we will be dealing with them .

environment
Mr. Murray Calder ( Dufferin - Peel - Wellington - Grey , Lib . ) :
as a farmer I would like the minister of agriculture to tell us in concrete terms what he is doing to protect Canada ' s soil and water systems .
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the department has been actively involved in protecting Canada ' s fragile environment .
recently we announced the $ 10 million national soil and water conservation program .
that $ 10 million will be distributed by adaptation councils and other similar groups across the country to conserve and enhance soil and water stability and quality , to conserve biodiversity and to deal with any adverse effects the uses of farm inputs may have .
the province of Ontario was the first to come forward with its application and I have presented it with a $ 625,000 cheque .

corrections CANADA
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , in the last two and a half months three violent offenders have escaped from the new minimum security aboriginal healing centre at Hobbema , Alberta .
two have been apprehended and one is still at large .
why does Corrections Canada refuse to alert the public when an escape occurs from this institution ?
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
i specifically remember the hon. member attended the opening with much fanfare .
we are very aware of any incident of that kind that occurs inside an institution and are taking action .

tobacco ACT
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , several times now I have asked the Minister of Health if he intended to take other sports and cultural events besides the Grand Prix into account in his bill to amend the Tobacco Act , and each time the minister has refused to answer .
will the minister admit that a bill to amend the Tobacco Act that did not take all sports and cultural events into account would create a completely discriminatory situation ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we have not yet introduced the amendment .
i intend to do so shortly .
i would like to advise the hon. member simply to wait .
i will introduce the amendment when it is ready .

the ECONOMY
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Finance .
the government ' s index on social health shows that unemployment , falling real wages and increases in child poverty continue to plague our country .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are concerned with all of the social indicators that apply to Canadians .
the prime motivation for the clean - up of the nation ' s finances was to put the government in a situation where it can address those things .
i am sure the hon. member knows that Canadians suffered from the trauma of a terrible recession from 1989 to 1992 and it took a long time for us to recover from it .
however , as a result of the actions taken since 1993 , all of those indicators have either stabilized or they have improved substantially .

national DEFENCE
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the defence minister neglects to tell us that without the inspector general , he is the only link between Parliament and national defence .
i learned this weekend of allegations of drug use at one of Canada ' s top military bases .
i also learned that the investigation made by the military was botched .
is the government prepared to tell Canadians that it is satisfied with the results of the investigation , and if not , why was it stopped ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the investigation has been suspended but it is not closed .
if additional information is brought out , the investigation will be reopened on the basis of that new information .
the investigation has been thorough .
i do not subscribe to the preamble of the question in which he said it was botched .
if there is new information it will be reopened .

immigration
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration .
the minister recently announced the immigration levels for next year .
in my riding of Vancouver Kingsway we always support the immigrants ' families .
is it true the new policy will reduce the family reunification program ?
Ms. Maria Minna ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government continues to be strongly committed to family reunification .
i should point out that independent immigrants also bring families with them when they come into this country .
the other thing is that applications on families are on demand .
we have no quota .
however , the family reunification numbers have gone down primarily due to a change of classification with families as a definition over the last number of years .
a legislative review is taking place .
the report will be tabled at the end of December .
perhaps the hon. member and other members of the House would like to participate in discussing how we might define family reunification in the future .

health CARE
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , on Friday the supreme court gave the power to this House to protect fetal rights .
the Minister of Justice said she would do nothing .
our jails , our detox units and our psych units are filled with the broken minds of people who have been damaged before birth .
is this minister going to do something to protect children before birth or is she and the government going to continue to do nothing ?
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I point out the fact that the Supreme Court of Canada did not give that power to the Parliament of Canada .
in fact , the Supreme Court of Canada talked about provincial legislatures .
i remind the hon. member that what we are dealing with is a very important issue of health .
therefore I suggest that perhaps he talk to the provincial Government of Manitoba in relation to legislative responses dealing with health and child welfare .

points OF ORDER
question PERIOD
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I bring this point of order to the House related to our need to ask ministers relative questions .
in a ruling from March 4 , 1986 the Speaker of the House ruled :
hon. members may not realize it but questions are actually put to the government .
the government decides who will answer .
Mr. Speaker , we were merely making suggestions to the government as to who should answer in this House today and why .
on May 8 , 1986 the same Speaker stated :
of course , the Chair will allow a question to be put to a certain minister ; but it cannot insist that that minister rather than another should answer it .
we should not be muzzled from making suggestions in this House .
the government may rise in opposition of this point of order and use citation 412 which supports perhaps the Speaker ' s position in your second decision today .
however , it was a ruling from 1968 .
there have been a number of changes to the way question period is conducted , including many Speaker ' s rulings and committee reports on this subject since then .
it is outdated , much like this government .
political ministers are an excepted reality and they should be accountable to this House .
this is at the basis of our Parliamentary system .
the government seeks ways to avoid accountability and this is just another attempt by the government to hide those outdated , obscure issues and points it has on issues relative to today .
i note a little while ago in this House a member rose and asked a question of this government about the Kyoto conference .
the minister of agriculture rose to answer that question .
in fact , it was very similar to the issue that we had earlier in the House and yet you allowed it .
i refer to Beauchesne ' s citation 410 :
in 1986 the Speaker put forth further views in light of more recent conditions and precedents .
it was observed that : ( 6 ) The greatest possible freedom should be given to Members consistent with the other rules and practices .
Mr. Speaker , I ask that you revisit the issue in this House today and allow us in future and even in the next question period to question the minister from Alberta on issues relevant to this House and to that issue .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as members know , I had also sent notice to the Speaker that I wished to address a point of order , the same one of course .
the point I want to raise is twofold .
getting back to the first point that I raise , the relevant citations of Beauchesne ' s , it has just been said by the House leader of the official opposition that a question can be answered by any minister .
that , of course , has been ruled on consistently in the past .
in other words , the questions are asked of the government and the government , if it so chooses , can then delegate any minister to answer .
that is quite properly cited in citation 410 .
the proper citation is in fact citation 412 .
the proposition is the following one .
can a member ask any question of a minister whether or not it is in his or her area of ministerial responsibility ?
quite clearly the answer to that is no .
citation 412 of Beauchesne ' s says :
a question may not be asked of a Minister in another capacity , such as being responsible for a province , or part of a province , or as spokesman for a racial or religious group .
journals , October 16 , 1968 .
i had someone research Journals for me and I want to read to members very briefly the applicable paragraph .
i read selectively here in the text for the purpose of brevity .
it says a ruling was then made to the effect that a question must be addressed to a minister in relation to his administrative responsibilities .
the point I am making here is that an opposition member or any member ' s asking a question to a minister knowing the minister is unable to answer , according to our rules , and then making editorial remarks to let the record show that the minister refused to answer is not only against the standing orders of this House but there is a question of political ethics the Speaker might want to look at .
on the whole issue of the language used in this House by the hon. member for Edmonton North , I invite the Chair to look at this as well .
the hon. member for Edmonton North in the past has complained and the House has admonished members for referring to members inappropriately or for using language which was not deemed appropriate .
the hon. member for Edmonton North will remember what I am referring to and I do not intend to repeat it on the floor of the House .
to attribute to someone certain characteristics of an animal on the floor of this House is wrong .
it has been said to be wrong in the House by the hon. member for Edmonton North and by the Chair .
Mr. Speaker , I invite you to examine that very closely because I believe that is similarly unparliamentary .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have absolutely no recollection of saying anything .
i do not know what this member is talking about .
if for any reason I said something about animalistic , I will apologize -
the Speaker :
i want to hear the point of order we are discussing .
i will hear the hon. Reform whip and then I will hear the Deputy Prime Minister .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , you have heard two sides of the story .
i believe that when you check Beauchesne ' s you will find that both the House leader for the government and the House leader for the official opposition have quoted that portion of Beauchesne ' s accurately .
Mr. Speaker , I would ask you in your ruling to consider two things .
first , the ruling which was read from Beauchesne ' s referred to activity in 1968 , times almost in another era .
nowadays when ministers are assigned responsibilities by the prime minister they are assigned extensive responsibilities , in some cases in provincial arenas .
for example , Mr. Speaker , I would ask you to consider the case of the infrastructure program where no infrastructure money , billions of dollars , can be approved without the minister in charge of a province signing off for it .
in other words , it is not fair in today ' s reality to say to the official opposition you cannot ask questions about that person ' s provincial responsibilities when billions of dollars of taxpayer moneys are signed off by the appropriate provincial minister .
i have dealt in my province with the minister of fisheries , who has dealt with transit bus funding in my riding .
they may be totally unrelated but I have asked questions in written form and I would hope I could ask in the House of Commons if that minister is responsible for signing off or not signing off for this kind of money .
i believe it is the privilege of an opposition party to ask questions germane to that minister ' s provincial responsibilities .
Mr. Speaker , I would ask that you take into account the different era we are working in today .
i am not sure if the proceedings of the House were even televised in 1968 .
they probably were not .
it is now a different era .
we have a different political reality .
i would ask you to consider today ' s reality as you read Beauchesne ' s .
my second point is that if the government has the right , and I think it does and should , to assign questions to different ministers , I would ask for a bit of tit for tat .
i am not sure if that is in Beauchesne ' s .
when that happens that means the jurisdiction is totally different from the main jurisdiction of that minister .
if they are allowed to just pick and choose who they want to answer a question , often for political reasons , then I think we should have the privilege on this side of the House to direct our questions to whomever we wish on that side .
they may not choose to answer .
that is their privilege , but we certainly should have the privilege to direct our questions to whomever we want on that side .
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. Reform member who has just spoken has totally misunderstood what happens when ministers answer questions .
they answer questions with respect to their departmental responsibilities or as acting ministers , designated as such in the absence of the departmental minister .
it is not just a matter of random choice by the prime minister or acting prime minister in the House .
if the hon. member is so interested in Beauchesne ' s , I direct the hon. member and , with respect , you , Sir , to citation 416 which states in part :
a refusal to answer cannot be raised as a question of privilege , nor is it regular to comment upon such a refusal .
reform members may say that is a citation going back many years and they may want to rely , as the House leader of the Reform Party has just done , on citation 410 which states :
then the hon. House leader read No. 6 :
the greatest possible freedom should be given to Members consistent with the other rules and practices .
if he wants to live or die by citation 410 then he had better read its sections 16 and 17 :
( 16 ) Ministers may be questioned only in relation to current portfolios .
( 17 ) Ministers may not be questioned with respect to party responsibilities .
i submit Reform members were totally out of order , pressing the Minister of Justice to answer because she is the senior Liberal from Alberta .
this is totally contrary to the very citation on which the hon. Reform House leader bases his case .
if he wants to live or die by No. 6 , he has to live and in fact die by the words of sections 16 and 17 .
hon. Reform members are out of order .
hon. members know what the rules are .
they should be questioned as to why in order to give a misleading impression , not necessarily deliberately , they are raising the idea the hon. Minister of Justice is unwilling to answer .
i am sure she would be delighted to answer , but unlike my hon. friends she has respect for parliament and wants to live by the rules and precendents of the House .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I do not want to step into the sandbox but I thought I might try .
i will be careful not to use traditional metaphors like quiet as a mouse for fear that I might become the object of simulated indignation .
i would like to offer what I hope will be a helpful comment .
i watched the exchanges carefully and watched you , Mr. Speaker .
there were a number of ways in which the question was being asked that made the questions , technically speaking , inappropriate .
i just want to put on record that I think there are appropriate ways to ask regional ministers questions about their region .
perhaps in your ruling on this , Mr. Speaker , you could advise the House on the proper way to do this so that people who are trying to do this can do it properly the next time .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will be brief .
the issue we are getting at here is accountability of ministers .
i think your initial instincts on how to handle the situation were correct .
the minister we are discussing is represented in Alberta as both the Minister of Justice and as the senior Alberta minister in cabinet .
Albertans are invited to make representations to that minister on all kinds of issues and that minister is used to deliver all kinds of messages in Alberta on behalf of the government that are outside her portfolio .
we know that all kinds of Albertans have made representations to the government through that minister on the issue of global warming , gas taxes , energy taxes , emissions and greenhouse taxes .
we believe it is therefore appropriate to hold the minister accountable in that role in the House as well as for her formal portfolio .
if the minister wanted to say in response to our questions that she has passed those representations on , that she has taken this position herself , that she has attempted to reconcile these positions in this way , or if she chose to say nothing , that is her prerogative .
however , we feel we at least have the right to hold her accountable for that other administrative position which she is purported to have in the province of Alberta .
the Speaker :
is the hon. member rising on the same point of order ?
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a point I would like you to consider when you are considering these other points .
the justice minister is also the Attorney General of Canada and as such is the chief legal counsel for the government .
she is called upon by all ministers when it comes to enacting legislation , including any legislation on the greenhouse effect issue .
i ask , Mr. Speaker , that you consider that point as well when you take the other points under consideration .
the Speaker :
is the Deputy Prime Minister seeking the floor ?
hon. Herb Gray :
yes , Mr. Speaker .
i wish to comment briefly on what was just said by the Reform member in question .
there is a clear precedent that the Minister of Justice , even in her capacity as attorney general , cannot be asked to give what amounts to a legal opinion in the House .
the questions that were put to her were not with respect to the legalities of legislation or policy on the greenhouse gas effect .
they were put to her as the senior minister in Alberta .
with all due respect to the hon. member who just got up , the point he raised is not consistent with the rules and practices of the House .
even though the precedent cited by the government House leader was stated in 1968 , I must say it has been upheld many , many , many times since then , including by yourself , Mr. Speaker .
i ask you to take a look at the way you have added precedential weight to the precedent of 1968 .
the Speaker :
this is new information , I take it .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
with regard to your decision , Mr. Speaker , and the timeliness of it , we have full intentions of pursuing the minister on this accountability question .
we would like to do that as soon as possible , probably even tomorrow .
we would like to ask that you deliver the decision on this as soon as possible , preferably before question period tomorrow .
the Speaker :
i have listened very carefully to the three sides of the argument , with the member of New Democratic Party coming in .
sometimes the Speaker is asked to make rulings that take us down a different path .
during the course of question period , in the preamble , notwithstanding the fact that they are short preambles these days , I am willing to give as much leeway as I can .
as as matter of fact , if I could criticize myself , it is because sometimes I give a little bit too much leeway both in the questions and the answers .
i did not know for sure where the first questions were going and it seemed to me that it might fit in .
perhaps in hindsight , as I review all of the words said in Hansard , I might want to reconsider .
i would like to quote another citation which I do not think has been cited today .
it is in Beauchesne ' s at page 123 where it states at citation 420 :
the Speaker has stated , " Of course , the Chair will allow a question to be put to a certain Minister ; but it cannot insist that that Minister rather than another should answer it '' .
when a question is put my general guideline is that a question is put of course to the government .
the government usually assigns ministers who will be in charge of a certain administrative function .
in the past other Speakers have ruled , and I have ruled myself , that the question must go to the administrative responsibility of the particular minister .
the question has been opened today .
outside the administrative responsibilities it seems now that we or some members of the House would like to open the question of regional political responsibilities .
i am loathe to proceed down this particular path because again in my mind I conjure up perhaps questions where every minister would be asked , for example - and I use this only as a hypothetical case to explain myself - what is their feeling on capital punishment or what is their feeling on abortion .
at what point in there do I intervene or do I and did indeed intervene .
i am deciding that I will follow the paths of previous Speakers and as much as possible - again I leave myself a little bit of leeway but not too much - if a question is posed directly to a minister , as my guideline , it should deal as much as possible with the administrative responsibility of the minister in question and not with a political responsibility .
if the House in its wisdom chooses to change the rules which you would like the Speaker to operate under then I of course am the servant of the House .
the hon. member for Winnipeg - Transcona has asked that the Speaker perhaps give an indication as to how a regional minister might be approached about certain information .
it is not the responsibility of the Speaker of the House of Commons to indicate to members how they should or should not put their questions nor how they should or should not answer the questions .
i would leave that to the genius of the members of Parliament , both in putting and answering their questions , so that they would be proper .
if in the decisions that I made today , perhaps in the first part , I was a little bit too lenient then I was ; I accept responsibility for that .

government RESPONSE TO PETITIONS
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 ( 8 ) , I have the honour to table , in both official languages , the government ' s response to five petitions .
* * *
federal PUBLIC SERVICE PENSION ACT
Mr. Speaker , I rise to introduce my private member ' s bill , the federal public service pension act .
this bill will place the superannuation pension plans of the public service , the Canadian forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on sound financial footing by placing employee contributions in private sector pension funds at arm ' s length from government .
it will be funded by employees ' contributions at the same rate as before , with the option of contributing additional money .
a pension account will be held for each employee within the fund .
the private sector fund manager will be selected by a committee representing the employees .
on retirement a lump sum may be taken with remaining funds placed in an annuity for the employee .
family benefits will be prescribed by regulation .
contributions are to be deducted from taxable income .
existing and accrued superannuation benefits will remain intact and protected .
the new pension scheme will come into force on January 1 , 1999 .
public servants , members of the Canadian forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police new pension fund will be funded with their contributions and real dollars will be invested reaping pension rewards .
parliament may opt to appropriate funds for the new pension funds but seeks no new spending by Parliament .

reform ' S TERRITORIAL PROTECTION ACT
madam Speaker , I have the honour and privilege once again to rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to introduce my private member ' s bill entitled " Reform ' s territorial protection act '' .
this bill seeks to protect the territorial integrity of our country .
the purpose of this enactment is to affirm Canada ' s sovereign indivisibility .
the Constitution of Canada forms a federal state that is one and indivisible .
the good people of Surrey Central whom I represent with honour want to accomplish three things within this bill .
first of all , we want to ensure that the Canadian federation may not be deprived of any part of Canada ' s territory except with Canada ' s consent , by due process of constitutional amendment .
second , we want to ensure that no province or territory may unilaterally withdraw from the federation .
finally , we want to ensure that no province or territory either unilaterally or in conjunction with any other province or territory can attempt to or declare its intention to secede from the federation and form a separate state .
my constituents and I believe that Canada is constitutionally sovereign and indivisible .
we feel strongly that no province or territory shall initiate , authorize , sponsor or permit a referendum to be held on any question purporting to seek a mandate for withdrawal or indeed the intent to withdraw from our federation without the federation ' s consent .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

conscientious OBJECTION ACT
Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 272 , an act respecting conscientious objection to the use of taxes for military purposes .
the purpose of the bill is to permit individuals who object on conscientious grounds to paying taxes that might be used for military purposes to direct that an amount equivalent to a prescribed percentage of the income tax they pay in a year be diverted to a special account established by this bill .
the bill would not constrain in any way the ability of government to spend tax dollars as it sees fit .
in introducing this bill I pay special tribute to Conscience Canada Inc. , particularly Orion Smith and Kate Penner , to the Canadian Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends , or Quakers , the Mennonite Central Committee and the Conference of Mennonites , et aussi Nos imp 么 ts pour la paix .
finally , I would note that a great deal of work and thought has been put into this bill .
i hope that it will commend itself to members of the House and that it will be adopted in this Parliament .

petitions
pay EQUITY
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I have a petition signed by scores of public servants and others who live and work in the Peterborough riding .
these people would like to expedite the payment in full of the moneys owing for pay equity since 1983 .
this is a long petition and I know that according to the rules I can only summarize it .
therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to urge the President of the Treasury Board to expedite the payment in full of all moneys owing for pay equity since 1983 .

is that agreed ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
government ORDERS
the ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE SUPERANNUATION ACT
Mr. Nick Discepola ( Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , it is a privilege for me to speak to the act to amend the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act .
this bill will extend the protection provided for RCMP members in the event of disease or death connected with employment , so as to cover any death , disease or injury suffered by RCMP members assigned to a special duty area .
i would like to take a few minutes to explain how this amendment meets an urgent need .
members of the RCMP , like other Canadian employees , are entitled , under a government program , to benefits in the event of disease , disability or death attributable to their employment .
a distinction is made , depending on whether or not the disease , disability or death is connected with employment .
in Canada , it is usually very easy to determine whether or not this is the case : it is connected with employment if it takes place in the work place , for example in a workshop , on a construction site or in an office .
injuries attributable to employment are those suffered during a work shift .
when a shift is over , the worker leaves his or her place of work and returns to private life .
in the case of those taking part in peacekeeping missions in dangerous zones outside Canada , however , the distinction between the periods during which they are on duty and those when they are not becomes blurred .
under the terms of the present act , the onus is on the employee to prove disability is attributable to his employment or service .
when Canada started taking part in international peacekeeping missions and sending members of the armed forces to areas of armed conflict , it was acknowledged that it would be unfair to oblige these individuals or their beneficiaries to prove that injury or death was attributable to their work and occurred while the individual was on duty .
under the Special Duty Area Pension Order , members of the Canadian armed forces injured or taken ill in special duty areas on peacekeeping missions , or their beneficiaries if they are killed , can count on the presumption that any injury or disease incurred while serving on a peacekeeping mission in a special duty area is work related .
this means that military personnel are considered to be on duty around the clock where benefits relating to employment or service are concerned , since they may be in danger at any time .
however , RCMP personnel taking part in peacekeeping missions in dangerous areas , termed special duty areas , even when serving side by side with Canadian forces personnel , are eligible for benefits only if their injury or disease occurs during a normally scheduled period of service .
whereas a member of the Canadian forces benefits from the presumption that an injury , disease or loss of life incurred while serving in a special duty area occurred while he was on duty and is attributable to his service , the onus is on a member of the RCMP to prove that this is the case .
the proposed amendments will solve the problem of the differences in treatment between members of the Canadian forces and members of the RCMP .
at the present time , for instance , members of both forces are on a mission to Haiti , which has been declared a special duty area .
in accordance with the Special Duty Area Pension Order , members of the Canadian armed forces are considered to be on duty 24 hours a day with respect to the risk of injury , disease or death .
members of the RCMP , however , are considered to be on duty only during their shift , and are therefore treated differently than military personnel participating in the same mission , under the same conditions , and exposed to the same dangers .
in addition to disability benefits , Canadian forces members injured or taken ill while serving in special duty areas on peacekeeping missions are also entitled to the benefits provided under the veterans independence program .
this program funds such services as are necessary to maintain a member in his or her home as an alternative to institutional care .
for example , housekeeping services or modifications to a house to accommodate wheelchair access are paid for through this program .
this amendment reflects the changing role of peacekeeping and how Canada , a country respected worldwide for its commitment to peacekeeping , has provided what many countries need most to sustain peace , a respect for the rule of law and a method of fairly enforcing that law .
with the RCMP ' s help , a troubled country may be able to build on the traditions and expertise of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to create a new respect for law enforcement and the law itself .
this bill is inspired by a desire for equity .
it deserves to be passed .
it deserves to be passed because it ensures equality of treatment for all those taking part in peacekeeping missions , whether they are military or RCMP personnel .
it deserves to be passed because it clearly acknowledges that the RCMP ' s contribution to peacekeeping has the same value as that of the Canadian Forces .
finally , it deserves to be passed because a member of the RCMP who serves his or her country in a peacekeeping mission ought never to have to worry about protection in the event of illness , disability or death .
our fondest hope , of course , is that not one member of either the RCMP or the Canadian Forces taking part in a peacekeeping mission in a special duty area will be injured , disabled , or even killed .
should this happen , however , it would be no more than fair for the additional protection available under this bill to apply to RCMP personnel and their families .
i am sure that all hon. members acknowledge the importance and the fairness of the amendments proposed to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act and that we can count on the support of all political parties to get this bill passed quickly .
i thank them in advance .
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to speak on behalf of Her Majesty ' s loyal opposition concerning a matter of great importance .
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act spells out in black and white what benefits the members are entitled to receive .
the benefits pertinent to the act and thus affected by this amendment relate to the injury or death of an RCMP member .
bill C - 12 addresses the issue of whether a member of the RCMP was on duty if he or she is injured or killed while serving outside of Canada ' s international boundaries in a peacekeeping role .
i appreciate that the act is not the place for minute internal RCMP policy which will be written implementing this amendment .
i would like to have the solicitor general and the government assure the House that the following points will be covered as this policy is written :
first , the RCMP division staff relations representative , DSRR , is part of the team writing the policy .
second , that a member of a member ' s estate be entitled to select as his or her representative in any claim the counsel provided by the pension commission or a lawyer of his or her choice .
if a lawyer of his or her choice is selected , that the RCMP or the federal government pay the legal fees in question .
i make note of this because a former member of the RCMP and the current member of the House , the MP for Selkirk - Interlake , was represented by a pension commission counsel in Winnipeg regarding a disability suffered on duty .
the commission ' s counsel , who is supposed to work for the member , was less than adequate to say the least .
his inadequate representation resulted in the member being denied benefits .
the point is that government supplied counsel is not always of the same calibre that can sometimes be obtained privately .
a member serving in a special duty area who is injured or killed has to have counsel of his or her choosing or choosing by the executor .
the member of his or her estate may not be able to pay for the private counsel to defend the interests from a government body adjudicating these pension cases which is always acting on behalf of government interests , not necessarily those of the member .
third , the question of " may be exposed to hazardous conditions not normally associated with service in peacetime " is one that requires spelling out .
i will use the example of exposure to AIDS and other diseases that are easily transmitted via bodily fluids .
members of the RCMP are exposed to many of these diseases in their on - duty normal workday in Canada .
it is only fair that the government recognize that .
fourth , the policy must also spell out what happens if an RCMP officer is given a 48 - hour rest period , for example in Haiti , and he is injured while engaged in leisure activities .
i would ask the minister to clarify whether the RCMP ' s superannuation act would pay benefits under these circumstances .
i certainly hope it would .
i am advised by the member for Selkirk - Interlake , the deputy critic responsible for the RCMP , that he supports the legislation as does the Reform Party .
until now , 24 hours on duty coverage has only been at the good graces of the solicitor general .
it is good to get this protection for the RCMP in writing and in this bill .
i will take a few minutes to review the situation of the RCMP as an organization which has been asked to perform duties above and beyond its normal function .
the pension act will play an important role in the future as the government asks the forces to take on new assignments .
i understand that there is a possibility the RCMP may be asked to send police officers to several other areas of conflict in the world .
the future is unknown but it would appear that there will be other requests .
as more missions are taken on , the chances of RCMP officers being killed or injured increases dramatically .
these peacekeeping duties normally entail monitoring , observing and training roles .
any member from any province can volunteer .
unless they are in the middle of an intricate investigation that cannot be handed over to another member or for some other personal reasons , most are allowed to go on the mission .
the problem for the RCMP is they are always under establishment strength so sending these members make the vacancies at home even more difficult .
while we all endorse the role of the Canadian RCMP in helping in these troubled areas around the world , they do have a responsibility and a job to do back home .
the government should ensure that if they continue to take members of the RCMP for this important role abroad , it fills in the gaps at home to ensure that justice is properly served .
finding members to play a monitoring or training role for the aboriginal police departments is increasingly difficult , as more and more First Nations take over policing their reserves .
if the government expects the RCMP to participate in these peacekeeping missions , more budget money will have to be given the RCMP so more police officers can be hired .
i appreciate that Canada has an international responsibility but the government has an internal responsibility to keep our streets safe .
it is interesting to note that in Haiti , where RCMP officers are serving at the moment , the average citizen does not have a rifle or a shotgun , only the government troops have one .
i wonder how abusive the Haitian government would be towards its people if they had guns and ammunition ?
i have heard that it will take approximately 150 RCMP officers just to implement the regulations concerning the Firearms Act which does not include those who will be investigating non - criminal Canadians for violation of these regulations .
therefore the number will be even more than that .
i am certainly pleased that the RCMP Superannuation Act is being amended to fully protect the men and women who serve the country in foreign lands .
canada has been lucky that there have been only minor injuries to date on the missions to Namibia , Bosnia and Haiti .
i would strongly urge the government and the RCMP to conduct an in depth study on the effect that these missions are having on the RCMP members , the straining of resources and what is needed to ensure that the RCMP can continue to meet its responsibilities at home and abroad .
as someone who has travelled abroad , I would like to add that the reputation of Canada and the RCMP is second to none .
we are definitely filling a very major role both in peacekeeping and in training police officers to ensure that the peace , which we hopefully can create , will be to some degree a lasting peace between the forces which are fighting each other .
there are a couple of issues in the bill which gave me a little bit of concern .
while the government has stated that RCMP officers who are killed or injured on duty will have their pension benefits protected , there does not seem to have been too much imagination put into the writing of the bill .
i think for example of the Vietnam war .
we now find that many people who served in the Vietnam war suffered seriously because of a chemical called agent orange .
it took many years before the government recognized its responsibilities regarding the damage caused by agent orange .
we must remember that in this particular case it was the American government that dropped agent orange on its own people .
therefore it had a double liability of protecting these people and providing indemnification to these people , but it took many years before it would even recognize there was a problem .
i would not want to think we would have the same problem here , if an RCMP officer or a member of our armed forces suffered health consequences , that down the road the government would fight all the way to not compensate that person accordingly , rather than respect his dignity and his contribution to helping society .
i refer again to agent orange .
unfortunately the offspring of those service people are also suffering .
there is nothing in this bill which would recognize that type of liability .
with the modern chemicals that we have , who can tell when problems will show up ?
one would have thought that in a two - page bill amending the pension act the government could have allowed for that kind of eventuality .
it does not take too much thinking to do that .
i also think of the problem known as the gulf war syndrome .
soldiers who came back after having fought that war are saying there is a serious problem which is being denied by their governments in the United States and in Britain .
the point I want to make is that the government should not fight these people all the way .
they have put their life on the line for freedom and for democracy .
they have willingly gone to protect the rights and values which we appreciate so much in this country .
when they returned home , having suffered the consequences of that volunteerism and that commitment to fight for democracy and freedom , they found that the very government which swore to uphold those rights was denying them the recognition of their claims .
i would hope that these types of things would not happen here in Canada .
however , unfortunately , I am not so sure .
disability shows up in many ways .
i think of one RCMP officer in my riding who suffers from post - traumatic stress disorder .
these are difficult things to diagnose , but I would certainly hope that when the regulations are written regarding this bill that these types of problems are recognized as befitting for compensation for those who are prepared to put their lives on the line to uphold those things we consider near and dear to our values .
changing the subject but still on the concept of pensions for the RCMP , I would like to bring to light an issue regarding RCMP pensions which I find is rather unfortunate .
it happened a little over a year ago .
several retired RCMP officers received a letter in the mail from the pension department saying that a mistake had been made in calculating their pensions .
these RCMP officers had retired between 1970 and 1974 .
twenty years later they received a letter in the mail saying " We made a mistake in calculating your pension .
please find enclosed a cheque to make up the difference .
we have short changed you all these years '' .
it amounted to approximately $ 10,000 each .
imagine their dismay when a year or so later - and we are talking about last September , just a couple of months ago - when these same people received another letter from the government saying " Guess what ?
our first letter was a mistake .
please send the money back .
we are going to reduce your pension cheque back to what it was before '' .
this type of incompetence is something I really do not particularly like .
as the chairman of the public accounts committee , I think the government should take note of the people who have done this , who thought they were on to something , did not check their work properly and wrote cheques in excess of a million dollars from taxpayers ' money , sent them off to retired RCMP officers , giving them the idea that they had received some kind of windfall then asking for the money back .
they even went so far as to track down the beneficiaries of deceased members to pay the cheques out to them .
now we find there was absolutely no legal basis for doing so .
it made a difference of 5 % because the deduction was 5 % per year .
in the words of the director general of the department , a zealous employee had gone back and discovered - and if I may say discovered in quotations - this error and decided that these retired RCMP officers had been short changed all these years .
i asked the director general in charge of the department why the change of heart .
the change of heart and the re - checking of the figures was because one particular retired RCMP officer said that if he had been short changed all these years was he not owed a little bit of interest along the way .
when he asked for his interest they decided that perhaps he had a point but that they had better re - check the figures first .
when they went back and re - checked the figures they found that because the legislation had changed in 1975 the way they calculated pensions had changed in 1975 and that the previous calculation was perfectly correct .
we have a situation where they have now gone back to 119 retired RCMP officers and their beneficiaries and said " Please send the money back '' .
imagine this type of situation taking place .
it is time the government recognized that competency goes along with accountability , that efficiency is not the only important thing , that they have a responsibility to do their jobs properly .
with one stroke of a pen it all disappears down the drain .
perhaps .
but then I ask , what about the civil servant who authorized this ?
do members think that his career should continue on as if nothing had happened , that the taxpayers are out a million dollars , so what ?
a million dollars is a major situation .
in the private sector if someone says to their employer " Oops , I just cost you a million dollars by mistake '' , should he continue on in his job ?
what confidence do we have that he is going to perform his duties competently and effectively .
i wanted to raise that point , but at the same time I do not want to finish on a down note .
i want to finish on an up note for the RCMP .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
it is my duty , pursuant to Standing Order 38 , to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows : the hon. member for Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , deficit reduction .
the member for Berthier - Montcalm .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I am delighted to rise to speak to this bill , which , I see , is of particular interest to the government opposite .
i would like to commend the member for Huron - Bruce , who seems to have put considerable weight on the government ' s shoulders this afternoon in the debate of an essentially simple bill , it is true , but one that warrants some comment in order to set out the position of the Bloc Quebecois .
i realize I have 40 minutes , Madam Speaker , but I can tell you right now that I will not use all my time , because we have just found a consensus in the House in support of this bill , which is an excellent bill , because it remedies something that is unfair to the members of the RCMP who took part in peacekeeping missions around the world .
yes , there must be encouragement for this kind of mission .
yes , there must be support for RCMP members who volunteered their services , who agreed to travel to foreign countries and share their experience by giving courses and training to the inhabitants of these countries so that they could have a good police force .
they must be encouraged in various ways .
it is all very fine and well to rise in the House from time to time and make ministerial statements in support of these people as they set out for other countries , but I think it would also be good if RCMP members who are leaving Canada for a short period but an important one nonetheless also felt supported economically .
bill C - 12 addresses this .
it was realized that there was a certain difference between members of the RCMP who went on a peacekeeping mission and members of the armed forces who went as peacekeepers or as part of other international organizations on similar missions .
it was realized that the men and women of the RCMP were at a disadvantage on their return with respect to their pensions .
this bill is very straightforward in that it corrects this particular inequality between the two groups .
the bill amends the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superannuation Act by finally giving peacekeeping missions by RCMP officers the same recognition as that given those by members of the Canadian armed forces .
i would like to take this opportunity to echo the sentiments expressed by all members who have already spoken and thank RCMP members for the excellent work they are doing and for their representation of our system outside Canada and Quebec . I think they should be paid tribute and be encouraged to continue .
however , as an opposition party , we are going to do our work properly .
i still have a few questions on this bill .
as I read this bill at the moment , I do not see this .
do those who remain have to pay more for those who leave ?
is the government investing more ?
where exactly are they going to get the budget surplus to meet the requirements of this bill ?
the answer is not obvious from reading Bill C - 12 .
we need a clear answer .
will those members of the RCMP who , for personal or family reasons , choose not to participate in peacekeeping missions end up losing ?
we do indeed have to provide some advantage to those who leave , but we must also think of those who stay behind .
i will be looking for answers to this question , for my own reassurance and to reassure those involved in the situation .
i have another question as well .
will officers who remain in Canada have to pay twice for officers on peacekeeping missions who are injured while abroad , because this does happen ?
we need to know how premiums are affected , as well as what happens in the event of injuries , so that we can determine whether , in the end , they receive the same treatment .
another question must be answered .
how much does the Government of Canada pay when it must send these people to other countries ?
as you know , when people such as RCMP members travel abroad on duty , they are paid by the UN .
does the UN contribute proportionately to this pension fund ?
this is another thing we do not know .
that will have to be looked into when the bill goes to committee .
at the beginning of my first term of office , in the 35 th Parliament , I was the critic for the solicitor general and I had many opportunities to work with members of the RCMP .
i know that those officers - I am not talking about senior officers - who do such things as going to Ha 茂 ti or other countries to give training and assistance are very professional people and believe strongly in what they are doing .
they are also very proud of their position .
i think that Bill C - 12 meets many of these requirements and that is why , knowing these people as I do , I am pleased to say that we support Bill C - 12 and will vote in favour .
the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of this bill , and we are going to try , when it is referred to committee , to verify certain things with RCMP officials , as well as with the Department of National Revenue or other government departments , so as to be sure that the money invested will go to the right place , and that all RCMP members , whether they travel to other countries or stay in Canada , are treated fairly .
Mr. Jim Pankiw :
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
we do not have a quorum .
call in the members .
after the ringing of the bells :
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the Chair notes that there is a quorum .
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to speak on behalf of my party in support of Bill C - 12 , an act to amend the RCMP superannuation act .
i will be sharing my time with my colleague , the member for Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre .
it is our position that this legislation , which gives members of the RCMP serving abroad as peacekeepers the same benefits as their counterparts in the armed forces in the event of illness , injury and death , has been far too long in coming .
while we welcome the introduction of this bill and we urge its speedy passage , we hope that in future , when we ask our young men and women to place their lives on the line for their country , they will not have to worry about their benefits and about our commitment to them .
bill C - 12 recognizes the unique nature of this job and takes the necessary steps to remedy the unfairness of the current situation .
this legislation that is intended to provide RCMP members who serve as peacekeepers the same health benefits as their counterparts in the armed forces is a step in the right direction and it is only fair .
more must be done to recognize the service of our peacekeepers and the sacrifices they and their families make in the name of peace on behalf of all Canadians .
the issue of equity for all of those who serve Canada must be addressed both at home and abroad , particularly with respect to the RCMP who currently do not have the same collective bargaining rights as their brothers and sisters in other law enforcement agencies across the country .
they do not have the same opportunity to advocate on their own behalf through free collective bargaining .
i hope we get an opportunity to address that issue in this House before long .
we hear stories of members of the Canadian armed forces and their families having to use food banks to sustain themselves .
why is it that men and women who put their lives on the line for their country and for peace around the world are forced to live in near poverty conditions when they return home to Canada ?
there is something fundamentally wrong when long expected pay increases for service men and women have been put on hold for five , six and going on seven years when just last month the Treasury Board approved huge bonuses for an executive group of the public service , bonuses of $ 4,500 , even reaching $ 12,000 per individual .
believe me , the significance of this was not lost on the hard working public service employees .
it is hard not to be jaded when they witness such a clear government bias in favour of the executive ranks while denying longstanding legally required pay settlements to the lowest paid workers .
RCMP members of the Canadian peacekeeping forces deserve equal pay for work of equal value , but so do all public sector employees .
we can only hope that this spirit of generosity and this new found sense of fairness on the part of the solicitor general can be extended to the Treasury Board .
public sector workers have been waiting for a decade for the federal government to make good on its obligation to pay equity and they are still waiting .
they are waiting for fairness , they are waiting for equal pay for work of equal value regardless of their gender .
they are a patient and long suffering group and they have come to realize that when you are waiting for a fair shake from this government you had better pack a lunch .
it is timely to address these issues , particularly as this week is veterans week , a time when all Canadians are encouraged to reflect on the great sacrifices made by all our members of the armed forces on behalf of Canada and on behalf of peace around the world .
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to join with my colleague from Winnipeg in supporting Bill C - 12 , an act to amend the RCMP superannuation act .
bill C - 12 will amend the RCMP superannuation act to ensure that the RCMP members serving in special duty areas are automatically considered to be on duty 24 hours a day and therefore get complete benefit coverage .
at present the act provides for coverage only during periods of scheduled shifts , which my colleague from Winnipeg referred to .
as all Canadians would appreciate , when a soldier or an RCMP officer serves outside Canada on peacekeeping missions they face all sorts of dangers not just during their duty period but when they are off duty as well .
we have seen many horrific examples of that around the world over the last couple of decades , in particular in conflict zones or special duty zones as they are called .
this legislation will make RCMP members who serve as peacekeepers eligible for the same health benefits as military personnel .
madam Speaker , I represent a district called Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , which you are aware of .
we have a number of recruits coming to be trained .
we also have a number of families working at the academy , at the depot , who have served on peacekeeping missions from time to time .
we are very confident because we feel the neighbourhood is very safe .
these RCMP officers who serve our country overseas do not just serve their country but their community with a great deal of strength , consistency and loyalty .
bill C - 12 recognizes this type of service and sacrifice by members of the RCMP .
i have worked on a number of issues in House of Commons over the past four years that are important to the RCMP and to the Regina Police Association .
the bill reminds me of an old saying .
it addresses one of the issues of an old saying I heard a while back that generals who neglect their soldiers in the battlefield will find it very difficult to find recruits when the next battle is fought .
i am very pleased to join with my colleagues in the NDP to support the bill .
however I want to raise one issue which saw the light of day as recently as last week with respect to some of the pension issues , in particular the RCMP pension issue .
the Solicitor General of Canada indicated that any additional cost which might be incurred by the change in Bill C - 12 would be assumed within existing RCMP budgets .
the federal government used another $ 2.6 billion from its employee pension fund this year to help lower the deficit despite a storm of controversy over the legality of the manoeuvre .
last year the government took $ 2.4 billion , sparking outrage from not just unions but also pensioners who have banded together to take the government to court to stop the practice .
the RCMP is involved with that court action .
i think Canadians are quite outraged and unhappy with this latest government move .
my sense is if the court challenge fails - and I hope it does not ; I hope they are successful - a number of politicians in the House of Commons will take the issue to the floor of the House time after time until the government deals with the deficit in a manageable , fair way .
taking pension money from people who have not yet retired and those who are retired is an unacceptable practice in any country although in some banana republics this is the course of action .
canada has a pretty good reputation around the world but it worries me that it is becoming one of a banana republic because of some of the actions of the Liberal government opposite that were supported previously by the Mulroney government .
we have to address the issue .
if the solicitor general is serious about supporting Bill C - 12 , maybe he could talk to his colleague , the Minister of Finance , and tell him to keep his damn fingers out of the pension till .
it is about time that happened .
i want to go on record as saying that we support Bill C - 12 .
we do not support the type of practices the Liberal government has instituted with respect to taking pension funds out of the public service pension superannuation for its own crass political purposes .
i assure the House that in the future we will be watching this issue very closely and taking it to the finance committee .
we will be raising it with the Minister of Finance in the future to make sure he does not make those pensions unaffordable or jeopardize the plan .
people who have contributed to these pension plans deserve them in their retirement .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask my hon. colleague a question that has to do with the last point he touched on , the raiding of a pension plan that is healthy .
it seems like it is too healthy for the government and it has to do something with it .
it has too much money in it .
in a case such as this one , would the hon. member recommend to the government that when a pension has an overabundance of funds those who contributed to it should benefit from it either by a reduction in future contributions or a direct payback ?
would the member comment on that ?
Mr. John Solomon :
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the question from the member for Crowfoot .
the Liberals cannot stand the success of other organizations or programs they are not directly involved with .
it is a very dangerous precedent .
the Liberal government is interfering with a pension system established through the collective bargaining process , I might add , to provide a pension for those who work in the public service , the RCMP or other federal government agencies .
it is a very bad precedent and a very bad omen that the Liberals are taking the surplus out of this pension plan .
when the actuaries established the plan through the collective bargaining process they said that x number of dollars would be deducted from the employees ' salaries , matched by the federal government , and invested so that they have a secure plan .
actuaries can only predict ; they cannot tell precisely what the future will hold .
obviously there is a surplus because of what happened in the economy , with investments , with the longevity of plan members and all other inputs necessary to establish the amount of money required to pay out the pensions .
the point of all of this is that similarly it could provide for a shortfall in the long run because it cannot predict how the economy will operate .
some decisions should be made in a collective way between employees and employers as to what the surplus should be used for , whether it should be used for a reduction of contributions or improvement of benefits .
i believe that is a very important point to be considered .
the Liberal government has made the decision , not through collective bargaining , to take out the surplus .
it is like closing the barn door after the cows have left .
that is a very bad omen for the country .
i see the Liberal whip is very supportive of my presentation .
i hope he will take this matter to the Minister of Finance , as I am sure he is quite supportive of what I am saying , and tell him that these surpluses should not be taken out of the pension funds because they rightfully belong to the employees .
Mr. Jim Pankiw ( Saskatoon - Humboldt , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the member for Regina - Lumsden said that if there is a surplus in a pension fund it should be distributed back to the contributors either in the form of reduced contributions or increased benefits .
in looking at the Canada pension plan it is just the opposite .
there have not been enough contributions .
there is no money .
in that case the Liberal government decided to put the burden of that on to the children of the country who do not have a choice in the decision .
i am wondering what the member thinks about that .
Mr. John Solomon :
Mr. Speaker , the member misunderstood what I said .
i said that the surplus of the public service pension plan is the property of the membership and that the surplus should be negotiated in terms of what its use and purpose will be .
i did not say that they should just pay out .
i said that some of the options are to reduce the contributions or to increase the benefits of the pension holders .
with respect to the Canada pension plan we have seen a different sort of pension plan .
we have basically two types of pension plans .
Mr. Bill Matthews ( Burin - St.
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to support Bill C - 12 .
my colleagues in the Progressive Conservative caucus and I support the legislation because it expands the scope of pension benefits for many courageous Canadians who presently serve or who have served as peacekeepers throughout the world .
specifically Bill C - 12 would provide peacekeepers who are members of the RCMP with the same pension entitlement in the event of illness , injury or death as peacekeepers in the Canadian Armed Forces .
our position in the global community is unique , since for the past 40 years Canada has built a proud tradition as peacekeepers throughout the world .
there are many countries in which Canadian men and women have put their lives on the line to help preserve peace .
indeed , Canada has been at the forefront of developing and implementing modern peacekeeping operations in the world .
this is due in no small part to the active involvement of thousands of members of the Canadian Armed Forces .
following the first 30 years of participating in peacekeeping operations throughout the world , the nature of Canada ' s peacekeepers has changed .
in 1989 , RCMP officers were deployed to Namibia in the former southwest Africa as it made its transition from a South African protectorate to an independent democratic nation .
no longer would peacekeeping remain the sole domain of the Canadian forces .
these brave men and women would henceforth have support from their civilian colleagues in the RCMP .
since 1989 more than 600 members of the RCMP have participated in United Nations missions to the former Yugoslavia , Haiti and Rwanda .
the RCMP has successfully complemented the Canadian Armed Forces involvement in peacekeeping .
by expanding upon the earlier success of the Canadian forces in many of the world ' s trouble spots , RCMP members have met a demand for peacebuilders in developing countries .
peacebuilding means providing developing countries with the tools to support a stable democratic government , namely an effective security force which is respectful of law and human rights .
RCMP members avail themselves to provide skill training in areas such as investigation , first aid and case management .
they also provide mentoring for individual officers and monitor their development as civilian police officers .
finally peacebuilding includes maintaining a safe and secure environment in which the developing police force can operate without fear of reprisal .
that last element of peacebuilding is probably the most dangerous for our RCMP personnel .
like their Canadian forces colleagues in traditional peacekeeping settings , RCMP peacebuilders often face violent opposition to their presence .
while the United Nations and this bill define peacekeeping locations as special duty areas , the everyday reality is much more precise .
these are deeply troubled areas in which Canadians are putting themselves at grave risk of injury , illness or death for the cause of peace .
for these reasons the intent of the legislation to put Canadian forces and RCMP personnel on equal footing with respect to Pension Act benefits is a positive one which I feel should receive priority attention by the House and Senate .
i should note this imbalance between Canadian forces peacekeeping benefits and RCMP peacekeeping benefits was neither planned nor deliberate .
it occurred under the evolution of Canada ' s international military and security role during this century .
at the beginning of the 20 th century there was no such thing as peacekeeping .
soldiers were soldiers and peace was enforced merely by the absence of full - scale war .
such a war became a reality with the first world war in which Canada paid dearly with a generation of its young .
in the wake of the the first world war ' s carnage , the government of the Right Hon. Sir Robert Borden introduced the Pension Act , which provided compensation for disability and death related to service in the Canadian forces .
put simply , if an injury , illness or death was attributable to or incurred during the first or second world war , a pension shall be awarded under section 21 ( 1 ) .
this is around the clock coverage .
peacetime service would result in the same benefits as wartime service only if it is established that the injury , illness or death was sustained on duty and was attributable to service .
the difference was clear .
if there existed a state of war , 24 - hour coverage was provided .
anything less and the restrictions were much tighter .
after the second world war Canada continued to be involved in international military operations during peacetime , such as in Korea and the Persian Gulf .
canada also introduced and executed the innovative notion of peacekeeping , which nonetheless placed Canadian forces personnel in hazardous conditions not normally associated with peacekeeping service .
in response to this evolution , the federal government introduced the Appropriation Act No. 10 , 1964 .
this bill allowed cabinet through order in council to designate special duty areas outside Canada in which members of the Canadian forces would be eligible for the same pension benefits as under section 21 ( 1 ) of the Pension Act ; in other words , 24 - hour coverage for Canadian forces personnel in special duty areas whether they be military operations such as in Korea or the Persian Gulf or peacekeeping activities such as the Middle East or the former Yugoslavia .
various governments have issued more than two dozen such designations .
our Canadian forces personnel have therefore been eligible for pension benefits in the event of illness , injury or death incurred in these special duty areas .
the RCMP has been eligible for the same pension benefits as those listed under section 21 ( 2 ) of the Pension Act .
in other words , the illness , injury or death provision occurred through peacetime military service was deemed to be equivalent to illness , injury or death entitlements for members of the RCMP .
the principle was confirmed under the RCMP Act in 1948 and confirmed in the first RCMP Superannuation Act in 1959 .
this was a logical provision for domestic RCMP service .
in an area such as Canada where peace is the rule , it makes perfectly good sense to link this type of pension eligibility to duty rather than to service .
in special duty areas peace is the exception , not the rule .
that is why the federal government changed the pension eligibility rules 30 years for our Canadian forces personnel .
that is why the federal government must now change the pension eligibility rules for RCMP personnel who are now an integral part of Canada ' s international commitment to peacekeeping .
that is the purpose of Bill C - 12 and that is why I support the legislation .
as has been referenced by earlier speakers , this legislation was introduced in the previous Parliament in June 1996 as Bill C - 52 . First reading occurred and then nothing happened .
nothing happened in the fall of 1996 session and nothing in the spring of the 1997 session .
it died on the Order Paper .
it is nearly a year and a half since the bill was first introduced and it has gone nowhere , thanks to the neglect of the government .
this bill would affect the entitlements of hundreds of men and women who have put their lives on the line in representing Canada abroad .
the Liberal government of the day did not have the respect for those brave Canadians to pass this legislation .
one must ask why the current government placed such a low priority on Bill C - 52 . Hopefully the solicitor general , as minister responsible for the men and women in the RCMP , has the answer to that very important question .
there is , after all , a first time for everything .
perhaps the Minister of Foreign Affairs , who quietly allowed the Prime Minister to assign Canadians to Rwanda based on a newscast whim , would like to explain the inexcusable delay in extending those benefits to the RCMP .
what has caused the reason for delay ?
by dragging its heals for a year and half did the government save huge amount of money ?
why did the government delay this rather straightforward legislation ?
i hope someone from the government stands up and answers these questions .
the RCMP personnel who are presently putting their lives on the line in such areas as Bosnia and Haiti deserve an answer .
i would like to commend those who spoke before .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , my colleagues have covered this bill very well .
i have a couple of points I would like to make which are outside the gamut of what the members have so far touched on .
the legislation will amend the RCMP Superannuation Act to ensure that RCMP members serving in special duty areas while on peacekeeping missions are automatically considered to be on duty 24 hours a day and therefore get complete benefit coverage .
at present that is not the case .
as parliamentarians we should take a very close look at the requests to send RCMP personnel into these kinds of situations , not only because of the danger involved , but also when we take a contingent of RCMP from Canada and send them into another country we do not replace them at home .
then we have a shortage of manpower .
if we have sent 200 members to Bosnia , or whatever the number may be , it means there are 200 less RCMP members here to do the work .
the RCMP are understaffed in many areas .
some of its special squads are understaffed .
in some of the western detachments a corporal is running a staff sergeant ' s detachment .
when the government decides to strip the RCMP of that kind of manpower to serve in an honourable way in other countries , it better take a good look at what is being done at home .
the old adage is that charity begins at home .
are we going to sacrifice the role and the service which is provided by our national police force when we send RCMP members into various countries for undetermined lengths of time ?
the budget of the RCMP , as well , is being chipped away .
our party is very much against that .
we feel that if there is an area that should receive additional spending , it should be in the areas of law enforcement and justice .
this will strengthen the justice system and provide the kind of safe streets and communities which the government likes to talk about , but is not producing very much , certainly since I have been in this House .
is he covered ?
the bill is not that specific in those areas .
therefore , we will be looking for confirmation in all of those areas to determine whether the bill is sound as it stands or whether it requires amendments .
i would like to again sum up by emphasizing that when we send members of the RCMP into these situations , we had better take a careful look at the hole that we are leaving at home .
the RCMP are in a very delicate situation .
can the commissioner of the RCMP or any senior officer stand up publicly and say " We are risking service to the public in this area '' .
we have areas that we should not be taking strength from but adding to .
i have spoken to members in charge of the special units in my area , in particular , in western Canada .
they tell me that without question they are short - staffed and understaffed .
when we send our troops abroad we are weakening our own forces here which means that we are not enhancing the possibility of greater safety in our streets and in our communities but we are doing exactly the opposite .
i hope that the members who have an opportunity to examine the witnesses appearing before the committee on this bill will put those kinds of questions squarely before the witnesses , including , I hope , the minister who attends and perhaps the commissioner of the RCMP .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
( motion agreed to , bill read the second time and referred to a committee )
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
i would seek consent to see the clock as being 6.30 p.m.
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the House has heard the terms of the motion .
does the hon. chief government whip have the unanimous consent of the House to see the clock as being 6.30 p.m. ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the House stands in recess to the call of the Chair .
on a point of order , the chief government whip .
Mr. Bob Kilger :
Mr. Speaker , if I am not mistaken , the hon. member for Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques is now in the House and prepared to speak .
i believe that we can continue with the business of the House at this point .
adjournment PROCEEDINGS
a motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved .
deficit REDUCTION
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
in this House , every possible point of view is heard .
the Conservatives want a drastic reduction in employment insurance contributions , but without compensating seasonal workers or young people entering the labour market , preferring to let them fend for themselves under unacceptable conditions .
the NDP does not want to lower contributions , but to improve working conditions .
as for the Bloc Quebecois , whose position is somewhere in between , it believes that with a $ 12 billion surplus by December 31 , 1997 , and possibly a $ 15 billion surplus by March 31 , 1998 , the government could carry over a yearly surplus , so as to have a cushion of $ 5 billion , $ 6 billion or $ 7 billion for bad economic years , while splitting in two the balance in the employment insurance fund surplus , that is by significantly lowering contributions to put money back in the pockets of those contributing to the program - employers and employees - while also improving conditions for those affected by the employment insurance reform .
contributions must be reduced to the point where people will receive a sizeable amount of money that they can reinvest in the economy , thus helping it in a meaningful way .
so far , the minister seems to have been deaf to these requests , and I would like to know why exactly , at a time when a zero deficit - possibly a surplus - is in sight , the federal government does not see fit to give back to those who have contributed the most to the deficit reduction effort , that is to say , to employees and employers , a substantial part of this money , mainly through the employment insurance fund .
in just two years , we have gone from a $ 6 billion deficit to a $ 12 billion surplus , which will soon grow to $ 13 billion .
this means that more than $ 19 billion has been pumped into the EI fund .
obviously , this is a wonderful money collecting tool for the federal government , but since those who are paying into this fund are individuals earning $ 39,000 or less , why is the government not announcing right now , or at least by November 15 , a significant cut in EI premiums , combined with improved terms and conditions ?
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
there is no question about that .
we have already made considerable progress in reducing EI premium revenues .
let me remind members that EI premium rates have declined every year since 1994 , down from $ 3.07 in 1994 to $ 2.90 this year .
there is the new hires program .
this program has been set up to enhance employing more people .
together these measures represent a cumulative reduction in EI revenues of some $ 4 billion from 1995 to 1997 ; $ 500 million in 1995 , $ 1.8 billion in 1996 and $ 1.7 billion in 1997 .
the EI premium rate for 1998 will be set later this fall by the Minister of Human Resources Development .
EI premium revenues are part of the consolidated revenues of the government .
please understand that they have been that way since 1986 at the insistence of the Auditor General of Canada .
it is certainly true that they are important to achieving our fiscal objectives .
a substantial reduction in EI premium revenues now would require either significant increases in other taxes , further large reductions in government programs , or an increase in the deficit .
as much as we would want to get EI premium rates down , we cannot do so prematurely .
this is an important issue and must be considered together with other key priorities of the government .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted .
accordingly , this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
( the House adjourned at 5.05 p.m. )

Tuesday , November 4 , 1997
the House met at 10 a.m.
prayers
routine PROCEEDINGS
government RESPONSE TO PETITIONS
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 ( 8 ) , I have the honour to table , in both official languages , the government ' s response to three petitions .
* * *
committees OF THE HOUSE
scrutiny OF REGULATIONS
Mr. Derek Lee ( Scarborough - Rouge River , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the first report of the Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations .
* * *
income TAX ACT
Mr. Speaker , passage of this bill would ensure that charities that have charitable status and therefore are able to issue tax receipts would have their charitable status revoked if they use any of the money for political activities , since the act concerned with charitable status specifically prohibits those charities from so doing .
it is time to put some teeth into the act .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

canada ELECTIONS ACT
Mr. Speaker , back in 1994 I ran an electronic referendum in my riding using electronic touch tone voting .
the time has come to amend the Canada Elections Act to permit Elections Canada to carry out some experiments with electronic voting .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
* * *
petitions
labelling OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have three petitions to present to the House today .
the first one has to do with health warning labels .
the petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that the consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems and that fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol related birth defects are 100 % preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy .
the petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to mandate the labelling of alcoholic products to warn expectant mothers and others of the risks associated with alcohol consumption .
the FAMILY
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the second petition has to do with the family .
the petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the House that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its value to our society and that the Income Tax Act discriminates against families who choose to provide care in the home to preschool children .
the petitioners , therefore , call on Parliament to pursue initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families who decide to provide care in the home for preschool children .
public SAFETY OFFICERS
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the third petition has to do with everyday heroes , our police officers and firefighters on the front lines .
the petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that police officers and firefighters are required to place their lives at risk on a daily basis and that the public mourns the loss when one of them loses his or her life in the line of duty .
the petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to establish a public safety officers compensation fund for the benefit of families of public safety officers , our police officers and firefighters who are killed in the line of duty .

questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Chuck Strahl :
with respect to Captain John MacKinnon of Chilliwack , B.C. , ( a ) when will compensation be given to him in accordance with the recommandation of the summary investigation into alleged professional misconduct , ( DND Document # 1080 - 3 TD 9307 dated November 29 , 1993 ) , and ( b ) when will the minister consider the alleged injustices of his inappropriate postings and final discharge from the military ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
the various complaints of Captain ( Ret ' d ) Mackinnon are now before the courts .
this matter is being reviewed by the Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces , and Captain ( Ret ' d ) MacKinnon will be advised shortly through his lawyers of the position of the Canadian forces in respect of his most recent request .
Mr. Ted White :
what percentage of those who claim to be self - employed did not pay any taxes , or declared losses , during the 1996 taxation year , and what percentage of those people who claim to be self - employed did not pay taxes , or declared losses , for every year from 1993 to 1995 inclusive ?
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
statistics for the 1996 taxation year are not yet available as processing of tax returns related to the 1996 taxation year is not yet complete .
shown below are the requested data for taxation years 1993 to 1995 inclusive for those individuals whose major source of income in the taxation year was self - employment :
( link to table )
Mr. Peter Adams :
Mr. Speaker , I suggest that the remaining questions be allowed to stand .
the Speaker :
is it agreed ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
government ORDERS
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) moved that Bill C - 7 , an Act to establish the Saguenay - St.
everyone will agree that our parks and national historical monuments are viewed as treasures both here and abroad .
in fact , yesterday I attended a meeting of heritage ministers from across Canada in St. John ' s , Newfoundland , and we were in unanimous agreement , including the Government of Quebec , that Canada ' s heritage is a great treasure as far as tourism is concerned , and benefits our economy , as well as nature .
i would like to show you just how much of a collaborative effort this bill has been for the people of the Saguenay .
the member for Saguenay - Lac - Saint - Jean himself was the one who conceived this idea and proposed it to the then Minister of the Environment , Lucien Bouchard .
that hon. member , Andr 茅 Harvey - my apologies , Mr. Speaker , I know we are not supposed to name MPs , but I feel this is important .
why ?
because it shows that a Liberal member is now putting the finishing touches to a fantastic bill that started out with a Conservative minister and has the support of the Parti Quebecois government in Quebec .
this shows how this country can function when we want it to , and how we can work together .
why did this happen in the Saguenay ?
why did we create the first marine park in Canada ?
we Canadians are often the first to do things .
we were the first country to set up a parks department , which is now more than a century old .
we were the first in the world to sign an international treaty on the environment , the International Transboundary Waters Act , which dates , I believe , from 1909 .
we have worked with the Americans on major environmental matters .
all Canadians in their heart feel a bond with the land they live in because of its size and because of its complexity .
we have how many time zones , how many climate zones ?
a small group of people spread out over a very vast territory , and what does that give us ?
it gives us a very unique feeling of how we and the land are partners together .
that is why we were the first country in the world to establish a national parks agency , the first country in the world to establish a transboundary agreement on the environment back in 1909 .
now today we have another first .
we are establishing the first marine park which started off more than 10 years ago .
it was the dream of a member of Parliament who was not of my persuasion .
he happened to be the local member of Parliament for the area .
he proposed the idea to the then minister who happened to be a member of the Conservative Party but who subsequently joined another party .
now we see it all coming to fruition in a way that I hope and believe every Canadian can support .
i think we are justified in being proud of our efforts , generation after generation , in hanging on to the jewels of our natural and historical heritage .
this is in fact the thrust of the resolution passed unanimously in Newfoundland yesterday , in which all the ministers , regardless of political party said " It is our responsibility to preserve our heritage and to improve it for our children '' .
this same vision and commitment has led us to establish parks and historical sites .
today , they underlie our efforts to create a new network of national parks and of marine conservation areas comprising 29 natural marine areas within Canada .
the federal government has a role , but it is really the people of Canada who are determined to establish legislation to protect this extraordinary and vital marine wealth .
together we are fulfilling a vision for parks and marine areas that is truly pan - Canadian in nature .
in the past two years alone we have made tremendous progress with the signing of agreements to establish Wapusk and Tuktut Nogait national parks .
we have also proceeded with the withdrawal of lands for future Canadian parks at Wager Bay and on Bathurst Island .
in total we have set aside a land mass of over 60,000 square kilometres , an area larger than the entire country of Switzerland , and we have done that in the past two years alone .
as we work toward completion of our Canadian parks system by the millennium we anticipate establishing new parks and conservation areas on Baffin Island , in Lake Superior , in Bonavista Bay and hopefully in the Torngat Mountains , to name just a few .
the bill before us today is the result of a joint project and the fruit of a real partnership , proof that Canadians are quite capable of producing grand visions together , when they pool their efforts to achieve a common goal .
i would also like to point out the great diversity of individuals , organizations and governments involved in this great vision .
the lesson learned was that nothing is impossible and anything is possible when people put politics aside and work together for the good of the planet .
it is about working together .
it is about setting aside our political differences and uniting around a common goal , that of preserving the ecosystem .
of course it is what Canada and Canadians are all about , people working together in the spirit of shared vision and co - operation ; people coming together as we did during the Saguenay and Red River floods with the spirit of co - operation and vision ; people from diverse communities with various political backgrounds , different levels of government , different ideas and interests coming together to protect a unique marine environment , to establish a unique marine park and to preserve this magnificent part of Canada ' s national heritage .
through today ' s legislation we are following through on our shared goal of protecting and preserving the natural environment contained in the park .
most significantly , we are ensuring better protection for the beluga whale , a threatened species that is native to this region .
the beluga whale grows up to six metres in length .
with its distinctly white coloration , high rounded forehead and lack of a dorsal fin , it is one of the world ' s most extraordinary creatures .
for years they have been known for their remarkably varied vocal repertoire .
Canadians have listened to their voices calling out from the sea for marine protection .
more than 500 beluga whales live within the park ' s boundaries .
the vast majority of Canadians have never seen a beluga whale , but they want to save the habitat for their children and for the children of the whales .
in creating this new marine park we are making sure that our efforts are working in harmony with our strategy for sustainable development and biodiversity .
together Canadians are moving toward that goal .
over a five - year period , the marine park will result in over $ 11 million being invested in the local , regional and national economy , and in the creation of 350 jobs in the region .
the purpose of this initiative is to increase the level of protection of the marine ecosystems and to promote public appreciation for the park .
our natural heritage is an important element that distinguishes us as a people and a country .
the bill before us today has the support of environmental organizations , aboriginal people and local businesses , which have already contributed $ 30 million toward the creation of the park .
the park is also unique in that it is the first federal - provincial salt water park .
Canadians are proud to live in a beautiful , vast and very diversified country , with coasts that cannot be found anywhere else in the world .
we can stop environmental degradation in this particular region of Canada and we can protect our natural heritage thanks to the efforts and the will of all concerned .
we started from Newfoundland and as we came out of the St. John ' s harbour , within a quarter of a mile of the harbour , I was able to pull the boat beside an iceberg which towered over us by about 300 feet .
what you do not see is about 90 % of the iceberg below .
not only did we see this iceberg but as we sat beside it and marvelled at its intense beauty as a part of an ecosystem which has been there for 20,000 years , a whale jumped out .
within the graph of a quarter of a mile of our land , we had mother nature of 20,000 years and mother nature in the form not of a beluga whale but a less endangered species of a whale .
there are times when the battles of the workforce in politics or otherwise can make you lose site of the bigger picture .
when I was there in the boat watching the whales from the pod jump , I had to say this is the nature of the land which we have inherited from our ancestors .
it is the nature of a land that we have a responsibility to give to our children .
in the establishment of the first federal - provincial marine park in salt water , we are setting a framework to keep this park forever , into infinity , not just so we can sail , if we have the means - and not everybody does - but so generations of young Canadians in the future can see what it is that drew people inexorably to this fantastic country called Canada .
when people like Radisson and Desgroseillers travelled through Hamilton on their trips to find furs , they experienced a feeling for their country that was shared with aboriginal people .
we have somewhat forgotten the true nature of this country called Canada .
this country is winter and winter is our country .
i believe that with the small step we are taking today by establishing the first marine park , we are recreating -
a magnet brought people to this fantastic country , whether it was several hundred years ago , thousands of years ago over the Bering Strait , or as late as this year when thousands of people chose to call Canada home .
i think the bill is one of the reasons we will continue to preserve a way of life that people around the world see as a magnet for their hopes and their aspirations .
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , this being my first formal speech in the House of Commons in this session , I wish to congratulate you on your position in the chair and the Speaker of the House on the democratic process that we went through a couple of weeks ago .
i know all of you are working very hard to make sure that parliament is conducted in a way that we can have our political differences but at the same time in a way that all decisions by the Chair are fair .
another thing I would like to do obviously is to thank the people of Kootenay - Columbia for vesting their confidence in me .
i was very interested in the comments of the heritage minister about her personal experience on the Atlantic .
of all the divisions within the heritage department probably parks are closest to my own heart .
i have been very fortunate .
my wife and I have reared three children on a lake in the Rocky Mountains .
i have a tremendous appreciation for nature .
probably the difference - this is perhaps a personal difference and a political difference - is the vision I have of parks in Canada as creating more of a balance .
there is a tension between the side of preservation of what we have in Canada and the access citizens and visitors to Canada should have to parks .
perhaps that is where we would end up with a difference of opinion .
because of the time I have spent at my home and in our own area I have personally seen and smelled grizzly bear , seen the caribou and the moose .
about 15 years ago in the fall during the rut I was rather chagrined .
as I was driving between two centres in my constituency a moose walked out very slowly .
i had just finished passing a Greyhound bus and I slowed down to a stop .
he kind of looked at the front of the car with that great big thunderbird on it .
i was wondering if he saw it as something he wanted to mangle or attack .
i was particularly concerned about the bus coming up behind me , that somebody might honk the horn in which case this animal might do something unexpected .
that is the kind of country I come from and I am very proud to represent .
i have a strong feeling about nature and what we have in Canada .
it is with that vision that I speak to the bill before us .
my understanding is that this is federally enabling legislation for an agreement between Canada and Quebec , signed in 1990 , to create a marine park at the confluence of the Saguenay fiord and the St. Lawrence estuary and to conserve and manage its marine resources .
bill C - 7 does not involve any transfer of land .
the Government of Quebec retains ownership of the seabed and subsoil resources .
the Government of Canada continues to exercise its responsibility over navigation and fisheries .
existing laws remain applicable in the park .
the legislative process that we enter into in the House is very important .
all steps in the process are very important .
in this case the committee work will be a very valuable part of putting this important legislation in place .
there is collaboration in the involvement of local and regional organizations in protecting the site .
it suggests that there is support for this 1,138 square kilometre protected zone .
it will be very important for the committee to hear from people about the issue so that we clearly understand we have representation from people and , if there are two sides to this issue , so that we clearly understand where the local people are coming from .
funding was provided for in the February 1995 federal budget and the federal contributions toward development and operating costs totalled $ 20.7 million over three years .
additional funding from the federal government has been $ 6 million between 1989 and 1993 and $ 4 million for green plan funding between 1993 and 1995 .
i am a little confused with the funding .
it will also be an important part of the job of the committee to take a look at the issue of funding .
i have the numbers for 1989 - 90 , 1990 - 91 , and so on and so forth all the way up to 1996 - 97 , where I see a total of $ 16.3 million in federal money went into the park .
i have two figures in front of me that I find a little confusing , $ 20.7 million and $ 30.7 million .
i heard the minister in her speech talk about the figure of $ 30.7 million .
i am trying to portray the issue of the dollars and cents .
the Reform Party is noted for looking after the financial affairs of Canada and calling the government to account for the way it spends its dollars .
the dollars that have been spent to this point do not appear to have been exorbitant or out of line .
however there does seem to be some confusion about them .
i would look to the committee to examine expenditures .
the legislation attempts to put in place a federal - provincial management regime that is already operational .
i also had the good fortune , as the minister just indicated , to visit Newfoundland this summer .
i cite this by way of example of the kind of work we must do in committee .
i cite Gros Morne as a template .
if we take a look at it we should be able to see the kinds of questions we should be asking in committee .
Gros Morne is 20 to 25 years old .
it is still in the formation stages and is working under an agreement between the federal and provincial governments .
the applicable laws and their enforcement come under the provincial government because enabling legislation has not been brought through the House to bring it under Parks Canada .
one of the good things I saw in Gros Morne Park was the relationship of the services being provided either to the park or to the visitors of the park .
they were very simple .
in Jasper National Park , Banff , or Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba people constantly run into conflict between commercial interests providing services to the park and its visitors because of an overlay , duplication , and many years of trying to jig and redo leases .
the beauty of Gros Morne is that the leases that have been negotiated have been done on the basis of a percentage of gross revenue .
we should be looking at simplifying leases , particularly for people who provide boat services and things of that nature .
another very good thing about Gros Morne is that the towns , although geographically within the park , are nonetheless not contained within the actual park boundary .
this has tremendously simplified the relationship of the towns to the park and to the park administration .
this is something we could learn about , for example , when we take a look at the conflict we are currently undergoing in the town of Banff .
we are talking about the moose and land animals there .
the problem with moose in Gros Morne is that they are literally eating the park to death .
i can see a situation forthcoming where there may even have to be a cull of moose because the park could actually be killed by the overgrazing of moose .
one interesting thing about moose in Newfoundland is that they are not actually natural to Newfoundland .
as a consequence they have adapted to an absolutely ideal territory but unfortunately are eating the park to death .
another interesting point is that we can learn from the Gros Morne template relative to this act and what happened with respect to the agreement on snowmobiles in Gros Morne .
when the agreement was negotiated some 20 years ago there was no vision , nor could we have had a vision , of how the capability and capacity of snowmobiles could be increased to extreme heights in terms of speed and carrying people .
as a result the agreement negotiated with the people in the area at the time is now called into question .
with access to the high plateau areas in Gros Morne Park there is actually what I call shoulder season problems .
in other words , if the snowmobiles are out too soon , or particularly in the spring when the snowmobiles are out too late , they are actually causing damage .
that is why I am suggesting to the House and to the committee that we must take a look at flexibility in anything to do with the legislation so that we do not end up finding ourselves in a box with respect to people who are running boats in this area .
we cannot possibly foresee the technological capacity of boats that will be in this area .
as a consequence we must ensure we have flexibility within any legislation and within regulations so that we do not end up with the same kind of problems with boats at Saguenay that we are currently experiencing with snowmobiles at Gros Morne .
as I indicated at the outset of my comments , I believe that the majority of people in the Reform Party and I have a different vision of Parks Canada than the minister and certainly the Liberal government .
we understand that .
however , we have a lot of difficulty when we try to apply preservation techniques and policies on an area where people are already coming into the parks .
i believe there has to be a better balance and a better approach to parks and preserves .
my vision of this in committee would be to look at it more from the perspective of the people who are presently going into this area .
as the minister indicated , it is important to protect the beluga and its environment .
at the same time we have to take into account that one of the major reasons for this park is for all Canadians and all visitors to have the potential for the same kind of experience the minister had with the whale and the iceberg .
i have one criticism that could be considered partisan .
once again the Liberal government is using the House as a rubber stamp .
when the minister talked about " putting the final touches " on this legislation , she also indicated there was a Conservative initiative to this .
why does the legislation come at the very tag end ?
why is it that when these parties are in government they consistently use the House as a rubber stamp ?
all the details were worked out with the province of Quebec long before it was brought to the House for any kind of discussion .
that is really unfortunate and takes me back to the first item on my shopping list for committee .
the people in the area and all concerned parties must be heard relative to their support for this park .
we have some documentation to back it up but let us hear the people in place .
what are the implications for commercial and sports fisheries on the St. Lawrence ?
what are the implications for other uses of the river ?
it is absolutely essential that the people who are presently using that area for its marine life be taken into account .
i cite by way of example a situation in my constituency .
we in Kootenay - Columbia are part of one of the major flyways for waterfowl that come from northern Canada and head south to the U.S. and further .
on the Columbia River are very delicate nesting areas .
we have to be very conscious of power boats being used in specific locations on the Columbia River , otherwise we would be really fouling up the waterfowl .
however , last summer in particular several idiots on personal watercraft roared through some of these areas .
i cannot imagine what if anything was going through their heads .
the net result of these few people who chose not to use their brains , who were acting in a reckless and irresponsible way - there was only a handful of them - was that the B.C. ministry of environment suddenly slapped a 10 - horsepower limit on an 80 - mile stretch of the river .
that really flies in the teeth of the people in my constituency , the vast majority of whom are very responsible , the vast majority of whom choose to live there , as I do , because we respect the area and we respect nature .
those people use the river responsibly .
now , all of a sudden out of the clear blue sky , boom , a 10 - horsepower motor limit .
that kind of knee - jerk reaction by bureaucracy not only does not solve the problem but actually ends up seriously irritating responsible people .
why do I say that it does not really solve the problem ?
if you could put a 10 - horsepower motor on something like a canoe - which you could not do because you would sink it - and ran it full bore up the river , you would create as much damage as these personal watercraft are creating in these nesting areas .
the 10 - horsepower limit means nothing .
with that in mind , what are the implications for commercial and sports fisheries on the St. Lawrence as a result of this bill and particularly as a result of the overlay of park regulations ?
that is another question we must answer to our satisfaction to ensure that we do not end up doing things unnecessarily and making people angry .
this 10 horsepower limit is seen by myself and many others like trying to kill a mosquito with a 10 pound sledgehammer .
it is unnecessary and would probably create more damage than was intended in the first place .
there is another issue .
unfortunately because of the separatist aspirations of the BQ and PQ we must take into account what kind of implications this bill may have .
we cannot just say " It is all drafted and it looks fine '' .
we must seriously examine what this bill means , what its implications could conceivably be relative to the relationship between the federal government and the government of the province of Quebec , particularly as long as the province of Quebec is represented by people who would break up this country .
we must be very careful with this bill .
finally , what precedents does this bill establish for future parks ?
probably more important , what precedents does it set for the establishment of other marine parks in Canada ?
legislation does not happen in a vacuum .
legislation works almost like an onion , layer upon layer .
for the people in the rest of Canada who may have a marine park brought forward in their area , we must be very careful to determine what precedents this bill establishes .
we cannot see the establishment of this park and the marine control in isolation .
the minister has already said there is a movement afoot - probably a good movement - to establish a full park system .
if we do not take into account what happens on the west and north coasts as it relates to marine life and the use of that water by existing and potential future users , we would be making a mistake .
we are concerned about a number of things .
we insist the committee go through these questions and other questions that will be raised by other members .
this will not be a committee rubber stamp process , nor do I expect it to be .
the parliamentary secretary , the secretary of state and the chairman of the heritage committee are fine gentlemen who will see to it that this is not a rubber stamp process and that we will have the opportunity , in a totally non - partisan way , to establish answers to some of the questions I have posed and hopefully some of the questions that other members will pose .
however , because we do believe this is a good bill in principle , the Reform Party will support it at second reading .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I rise today to speak on Bill C - 7 , the short title of which is the Saguenay - St.
Lawrence Marine Park Act .
i am pleased to announce at the outset - and this will not come as a surprise either - that the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill .
these bills were Bill 86 in Quebec and Bill C - 78 in Canada .
they are aimed at enhancing the level of protection of the ecosystems in part of the Saguenay River fjord and the northern St. Lawrence estuary to ensure conservation , while at the same time promoting its use for educational , recreational and scientific purposes , for the benefit of present and future generations .
at the time these two bills were tabled , the Minister of Canadian Heritage described the legislation as , and I quote :
- the result of several years of concerted efforts between the Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec .
as for the hon. David Cliche , then Quebec ' s environment and wildlife minister , he stated :
we are proud of the positive result of our consultations and are convinced we have met the expectations of the public and of the many partners who will be associated with a project of this magnitude .
what therefore was the purpose of the agreement that led to the establishment of this marine park , which is located in an internationally recognized tourist sector and which will boost an already strong and lasting tourist industry ?
the marine park project was apparently launched in 1985 .
on June 3 , 1988 , Canada and Quebec agreed that they should sit down together and talk about establishing a marine park in the Saguenay .
the parties recognized , and I quote :
the importance and the urgency of protecting and preserving for the present and for future generations the exceptional flora and fauna of the marine territory at the confluence of the Saguenay River and the northern half of the St. Lawrence estuary and of developing said flora and fauna .
it was to be almost another two years before the two governments worked out an agreement , which they signed on April 6 , 1990 .
under this agreement , both governments undertook , within the limits of their constitutional authority , to cause to be passed legislative or regulatory measures for the purpose of , and I quote :
( a ) establishing a marine park to be known as the Saguenay Marine Park located at the confluence of the Saguenay River and the northern half of the St. Lawrence estuary ;
( b ) preserving the aquatic flora and fauna , and maintaining the integrity of ecosystems in this territory ;
( c ) protecting the territory and other resources ;
( d ) developing these resources for the benefit of present and future generations ;
( e ) creating public awareness of these resources .
in addition , this agreement created a joint committee that was to report to each government within six months of the signing of the agreement , in other words around October 1990 , regarding the legislative or regulatory measures they should pass .
in article 2 , the agreement set out the provisional boundaries of the Saguenay Marine Park and both governments gave themselves four months to agree on a detailed description of the park ' s provisional boundaries , and a maximum of nine months within which both governments would carry out a public consultation prior to defining the permanent boundaries of the park .
article 3 of the agreement confirmed the rights and authorities of each of the governments , which became , as it were , co - owners of the park .
thus , under this agreement , the Quebec government maintains ownership of the sea floor and of surface and subsurface resources , whereas the federal government continues to exercise its jurisdiction in matters including navigation and fisheries .
this is in fact a first in Canada , since this park will be under joint federal - provincial management , and neither party will have to relinquish anything to the other .
with an increasing willingness to co - operate in the best interests of taxpayers who are always seeking an end to useless duplication and overlap , the two governments have agreed to harmonize their initiatives and the initiatives of their respective departments and agencies .
they have even agreed , under article 4 of the agreement , to share present and future infrastructures , facilities and equipment in the marine park , provided that one of the governments makes such a request to the other .
in addition , the two governments have created a committee with two representatives from each of the governments , whose task will be to find ways to further harmonize efforts .
the committee ' s mandate is to harmonize initiatives by Canada and Quebec , especially in the areas of planning , research , management plan development and programming activities , consultation with concerned individuals and groups , integration of development efforts , arrangements for sharing existing and planned infrastructures , facilities , and equipment , scheduling , personnel exchanges , communications and organization of seminars , symposiums and exhibits , marine fauna and flora and public security .
this proposed marine park innovates in three main areas .
to begin with , it is the first time in Quebec that a park is given the mission of protecting a marine environment .
furthermore , it is the first time that the governments of Canada and Quebec work together to establish a park .
and finally , there has never before been such an innovative consultation process .
in this regard , I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this project originated at the grassroots level and evolved to finally reach Parliament , contrary to numerous projects that are of a centralizing nature and that originate with the government and are imposed on the population .
the Reform Party must be very pleased with this , because the establishment of this park reflects exactly what the population of this region wants .
i would like to give a broad outline of the consultation process .
in December 1990 , the two governments held joint public hearings to determine the park ' s boundaries .
the mandate of the committee was to advise planners on , first , the way the park project was perceived in the area and , second , the content of a development proposal .
the committee and the representatives of the ministers concerned were able to bring to the fore the issues involved and to show the interest the people had for a marine park .
in April 1993 , both governments made public the boundaries of the park and announced at the same time public consultations on the development proposal .
the governments had everything they needed to prepare the master plan for the marine park , which was released at the beginning of 1996 .
after more than 10 years of talks and negotiations between the governments in Ottawa and Quebec , the National Assembly made the project official on June 5 , 1997 , by passing Bill 86 which had been introduced on December 12 , 1996 .
however , the Quebec legislation will only come into force once Bill C - 7 receives royal assent .
however , Bill C - 78 , which was introduced in the House of Commons in December 1996 at the same time as the bill in Quebec City , met with a very different fate .
instead , the government chose to let it die on the Order Paper .
the long awaited Bill C - 7 before the House today at second reading is the result of many years of joint efforts on the part of the governments of Quebec and Canada .
thanks to this co - operation , they were able to set joint objectives for the management and protection of the area ' s rich and diverse marine resources , particularly to better protect an endangered species , the beluga .
the management plan tabled in February 1996 , after extensive public consultation , mentions the existence of a consensus on the conservation of marine ecosystems and the development of the park .
both pieces of legislation have the same objectives , namely the conservation and development of the marine environment .
the two bills complement each other , without losing sight of the constitutional jurisdiction of each level of government .
without going into detail , I will recall the main elements of the bill as outlined in the summary .
it will be the first federal - provincial salt water marine park .
it implements the 1990 federal - provincial agreement .
it deals with the water column within the park boundaries .
the bill provides for joint management of the parks and the creation of committees for that purpose .
among other things , the governments will jointly establish a harmonization committee to coordinate their respective planning and management activities .
the legislation also provides for the creation of a co - ordinating committee , which will give members of the community the opportunity to participate in the improvement of the protection measures and the promotional activities for the park .
that co - ordinating structure involves both levels of governments , the regional stakeholders and the band council of the Essipit Montagnais .
furthermore , the management framework included in the management plan published jointly by both governments under the title " Crossroads of Life , Site of Exchanges , Wellspring of Riches " states that this plan has created a co - ordination zone .
the document defines that zone as follows :
the marine park territory and the surrounding regions form the co - ordination zone .
besides the territory of the park itself , the zone stretches from Chicoutimi to Tadoussac and includes all municipalities bordering the fjord .
along the north shore of the St. Lawrence , the co - ordination zone stretches from Saint - Fid 猫 le - de - Mont - Murray to Les Escoumins and includes the territory of the Essipit aboriginal community .
on the south shore , municipalities along the estuary from Kamouraska to Trois - Pistoles are part of the zone .
the bill requires that management plans be prepared and laid before Parliament .
it provides that a management plan shall be laid before Parliament within one year after the establishment of the park .
afterwards , the management plan will have to be reviewed at least once every seven years and laid before Parliament .
the bill creates a procedure for changing park boundaries .
as presently provided , its territory contains 1,138 square kilometres and covers a representative part of the marine environment of the fjord and the estuary .
this territory includes the Saguenay River from the mouth of the river up to Cap de l ' Est , located about 40 kilometres east of Chicoutimi , as well as the north estuary of the St. Lawrence River from Gros Cap 脿 l ' Aigle , located about 10 kilometres east of the town of the same name , up to Pointe Rouge or Les Escoumins .
the boundaries could be changed by order in council , provided that the Government of Quebec has given its approval and that both ministers of both levels of government have jointly consulted the public on this issue .
it is interesting to note that , in this bill , the public is directly involved in the management of the park , since both the federal and the provincial minister must encourage the people to take part in the development of the park ' s policies and management plan and in the examination of all major related issues .
the bill reaffirms the protection of natural and cultural resources and of the park ' s ecosystems .
is also includes measures to protect the health and safety of all visitors inside the park .
the bill also stipulates the offences and penalties for every person who contravenes this legislation or its regulations .
it gives the park wardens the same powers of arrest granted peace officers in the Criminal Code .
anyone found guilty of an indictable offence is liable in the case of a natural person , to a fine not exceeding $ 20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years , or to both .
in the case of a corporation , the maximum fine is $ 500,000 .
the bill is quite clear .
all resource exploration and development activities in mining and energy production will be prohibited within the park ' s boundaries .
the bill describes clearly all the management and planning activities that will be necessary for proper operation of the park .
local residents will be provided with the means to conserve this area , and its flora and fauna .
the park will generate jobs in the areas of nature conservation , site development , territory protection and tourist industry .
during the development phase , there will be jobs in infrastructure construction and site development .
scientists will certainly contribute to the supervision of environmental aspects of this work .
in the longer term , there will be job creation for conservation officers involved in the protection of the park and the security of visitors , for employees in charge of the maintenance of the park and its various sites , and interpreters to help visitors enjoy the park .
the marine park will be a new attraction that will bring new tourists in this area and keep those who had already been going there for a longer period .
these tourists will generate new benefits for the accommodation industry , restaurants , and cultural and leisure activities .
the establishment of this park will especially help preserve , for future generations , a precious and unique regional ecosystem that is found nowhere else in Quebec or in Canada .
it is Heritage Canada ' s job , through Parks Canada , to assign resources to the protection of the environment , just as Quebec ' s environment and wildlife department does in Quebec .
Quebec has always been protective of its territory and has always reluctantly accepted to let Canada settle on its land .
today , the Department of Canadian Heritage has given Parks Canada the mandate to manage two national parks in Quebec , Forillon and la Mauricie ; a national park reserve , the Mingan Islands ; four navigable historic canals ; 21 historic sites ; and a development program of approximately a hundred commemorative plaques .
through its environment and wildlife department , the Government of Quebec already manages 50 ecological reserves and 17 parks , and it has reserved 18 territories in the north with the intention of turning them into parks .
the establishment of a new partnership with the Government of Canada meant that the Government of Quebec had to initiate a whole process of discussion , of consultation , of co - ordination and of planning before going ahead with this marine park .
if Quebec had acted alone in creating this park , there would certainly have been less discussion , less compromise , no jurisdictional problems and , most of all , no need to wait for Ottawa to pass this legislation .
but , for now , Quebec is still part of Canada .
the adoption of this bill will allow Quebec to go ahead with the joint project to create a marine park and to recover some of the tax money it pays each year to the federal government .
in closing , I would like to read another excerpt from the management plan to which I was referring earlier .
i quote :
today , our society is looking to renew its interest in the marine environment and all the memories it holds .
like yesterday ' s explorers and hunters , today ' s visitors relive the excitement of an encounter with marine mammals ; they become image hunters .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
in my riding the significance of our natural surroundings affects our very lives and livelihood .
our streams , rivers , lakes , forests and agricultural lands provide sustenance to all who reside there .
whether it is the citizens in the north or the citizens in the south , the need to maintain and preserve the ecosystem is a belief shared by everyone .
the disgraceful state of the river at the time was best signified by the dead and dying St. Lawrence beluga whales washing ashore .
toxic contaminants from upriver sources have been identified as the primary culprit .
the establishment of a marine park it is hoped will assist in the recovery of this endangered species .
the rich diversity of marine life found at the confluence of the Saguenay fjord and the St. Lawrence River supports many species and is visited each summer by blue whales , fin whales , minke whales and on occasion by humpback and sperm whales .
the whales represent the top of the park ' s marine food chain and efforts to correct the damage to this area inflicted by man deserve our support .
there is another fact which may be overlooked .
millions of people depend upon the waters of the St. Lawrence for drinking water , recreational and employment purposes .
given the endangered state of the St. Lawrence beluga , a victim of outdated practices and environmental impacts , the risk to people is acknowledged .
the requirement for the protection of this ecosystem becomes an absolute necessity .
it is a hallmark in intergovernmental co - operation .
both levels agreed to honour their respective jurisdictions .
throughout the years which followed , they discussed , consulted and overcame adversity .
on June 5 , 1997 the proposed legislation received Quebec legislature assent .
the degree of public participation and input must also be recognized .
the communities were consulted .
aboriginal participation was ensured .
we hope that the co - ordinating committee , a key component toward the park ' s success , will continue the spirit of goodwill to provide input and direction that is both productive and proactive .
a fine example of how the public consultation principle can be incorporated into a decision making process occurred when all parties agreed to expand the park boundaries from 746 square kilometres to 1,138 square kilometres .
environmental groups and marine scientists for the most part were acknowledged and listened to beyond political agendas or preferences of the day .
the management plan will define the ability for the ecosystem to survive , to thrive and to provide a sustainable use of the natural resources .
there are several concerns that various stakeholders have expressed on proposed management plans , parameters and restrictions .
i look forward to raising these important considerations at committee .
there is agreement between all proponents that it is imperative to establish the park for the belugas , for the hundreds of marine species , for the preservation and enjoyment of future generations .
there is agreement between many proponents that to ensure this principle ' s success , several basic standards are absent from the proposed legislation as written today .
there is very little language in Bill C - 7 referring to the conservation mandate of the park and Parks Canada .
a suggestion from the World Wildlife Fund , active proponents and contributors to this process , is the strengthening of the language in the preamble and the purpose of the bill .
the park is being created not just to protect but to conserve and maintain the integrity of the natural ecosystems within the park ' s boundaries .
perhaps we should ask why there is no mention of species at risk .
through the years this can be interpreted as a basic oversight easily corrected by committee .
i believe that a second sentence can be added to the purpose of the bill or to the preamble to the effect that " this will be done by preserving and maintaining the natural ecosystems within the park boundaries , and in particular by protecting and aiding the recovery of species and populations designated as at risk '' .
fine words written by our friends and a principal tenet I am proud to refer to the House .
proponents have requested that the bill should include the Parks Canada guiding principles to be used as the definitive reference to guide park operations .
proponents have requested that some of the zone one areas , those areas deemed as vital for integral preservation , be expanded .
concerns on a complete ban on bottom trawling to prevent the disturbance of contaminated sediments which will cause further ecological damage is proposed also .
the cornerstone to this park ' s sustainable success will be restrictions on recreational and commercial impacts upon breeding areas and other areas in this region deemed as critical for marine life preservation .
we believe a balance can be struck to ensure the economic benefits gained by the surrounding communities through ecotourism initiatives .
we believe that the environment and jobs are not inconsistent when managed wisely in a sustainable manner .
this process has evolved over many years .
i am confident that any conflicts or differing views in management plan procedures can be addressed at committee .
a national marine conservation areas policy is in its infancy .
although a national marine parks policy was produced over a decade ago , a lack of practical experience has led to a continuing study and consultation period .
parks Canada is recognized internationally for its professional standards , its high degree of determination to ensure the conservation and preservation of Canada ' s national parks .
it is truly to be congratulated .
the protection of our wilderness areas is often thought of in terrestrial terms , semi - closed ecosystems which have defined components based on specific locations and limited outside impacts .
there are Jasper , Gros Morne , Wood Buffalo , Fundy , Kluane , La Mauricie , Grasslands , Prince Albert , Cape Breton Highlands and over 20 other national parks in this fine country .
Banff , the original jewel , was established in 1885 .
today we refer to committee another effort to preserve a part of our national heritage for future generations .
however , I must explain to my colleagues the responsibilities we accept today are on behalf of all Canadians .
the proposed legislation recognizes the respect for alternate jurisdictions and I join my colleagues to commend the fine degree of co - operation demonstrated by the federal and Quebec governments toward this noble cause .
the federal government ' s responsibilities will include the overlying water column and exercising its legislative jurisdiction over marine resources and maritime transportation activities in this territory .
the Quebec government retains administration for the seabed and subsoil resources .
the water column is the fundamental component for this park ' s success .
the water column is a transportation medium for the pollutants which contribute to the near demise of the St. Lawrence belugas .
the water column is a fluid highway that delivers the outfalls and ecosystem degradation from a distant point to impact upon our best intentions and efforts which will determine a recovery or loss .
there will be a new era of scientific and educational unity which cannot be destroyed by political interference or self - serving agendas of the day .
the water column has the capacity to transport the nutrients and support requirements for the regeneration of this area .
through conscious efforts to conserve and maintain the integrity of the marine ecosystems within the park ' s boundaries we have the opportunity to improve and contribute to the betterment of adjacent and distant regions .
the protection of the proposed park will require an effective management plan and I agree with the concerns raised by my colleagues on behalf of concerned Canadians and international organizations .
in addition to the aforementioned concerns and comments we must accept the responsibility which is this and future governments ' duty to ensure .
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans must commit to a comprehensive monitoring program in the park .
the department must commit to acting in a responsible and co - operative manner .
this responsibility will include the budget allocation for adequate personnel and sufficient equipment to fulfil jurisdiction requirements .
this responsibility will include a comprehensive emergency spill contingency plan and a capability for effective implementation .
this responsibility will include swift response and acceptable enforcement measures on those occasions when deleterious and detrimental impacts from beyond park boundaries are identified .
this responsibility will include first and foremost the capacity and sincerity to act within park boundaries to ensure the park ' s success to maintain and preserve the marine ecosystem .
i believe a balance can be struck to ensure the economic benefits which can be attained through ecotourism initiatives .
i believe that jobs and the environment are not inconsistent when managed in a wise and sustainable manner .
however , the pursuit of one must not damage the effort of another .
the first test of this government ' s sincerity for marine protection will arise during the definition and restriction phase of management plan parameters .
again , a balance can be struck to affirm long term recovery and park viability .
however , the concerns raised by the scientific community cannot be ignored or misrepresented as has been done in the recent past .
without conscientious efforts to balance tourism and the protection and perhaps the expansion of zone 1 areas within the park we will end up without marine inhabitants to present to tourists .
in the words of one marine scientist we must avoid the project becoming " Disney does Beluga '' .
i am confident that such concerns will be presented at committee and acted upon with foresight and objective considerations .
i am pleased to join my colleagues across both sides of the House in support to refer this bill in principle to committee for final review .
for our children ' s future I encourage all my colleagues on both sides of this House and in the Quebec legislature to support not only this bill but other environmental initiatives that protect the future for our children .
on behalf of the New Democratic caucus I am pleased to offer my support to referring this bill to committee for final review .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie ( Louis - H 茅 bert , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I have just listened to the previous speaker and I am very pleased that he approves of Bill C - 7 , since it is a bill that has its roots in an enhanced community consciousness .
i have also listened to my colleague from Rimouski - Mitis , who explained the mechanisms that will enable local and regional authorities to remain actively involved in this matter .
i have already said , and will repeat it here in this House , for it is a statement that comes from the heart : my roots are in the Bas - du - Fleuve , the lower St. Lawrence , Kamouraska to be precise .
this bill touches me particularly , therefore , in some ways .
there has been much reference to the beluga , but there is also much to be said for the beauty of the whales that frequent this region , to the delight of visitors .
obviously the population density is such that , as there is as yet no recognized park , we have visitors who are passing through .
there has been reference to the beluga and it must also be pointed out in this context that the presence of visitors must be properly managed if we want to still have these animals around and to be able to observe them .
in the past , and this may be what has raised people ' s awareness , there has been abuse , or at least there have been problems in regulating who would show visitors around .
now I believe this is a thing of the past , and we will no longer have such abuse , once there is a regulated park .
the need for environmental standards was also mentioned in the speeches .
i think we have no choice but to tighten environmental standards if we are to keep and increase marine animal populations .
on this subject , people speak of the mouth of the Saguenay .
the Kamouraska archipelago is populated by wild migratory birds .
on the coasts of Norway and of Europe , people have come to live on , use and speak of marine algae .
these people , who enjoy working with algae , are delighted by the number and variety of algae on the rocks of the Kamouraska archipelago .
for all these reasons , which are partly emotional , I admit , and partly for the pleasure of tourists , I am delighted at the co - operation between the governments of Quebec and Canada on Bill C - 7 , and I invite all members of this House to support it .
Mr. Peter Stoffer :
it is an example of what we can do when we have a vision of the future , of what we can do not only to protect other species but to protect ourselves as well .
a true testament of man is not what we have left for our children in terms of finances and the type of homes they live in .
if we see species in our realm today will our children be able to witness them as well ?
i know my great grandparents read about things like the passenger pigeon which is no longer available .
we in our lifetimes in this House will never get to see such a beautiful creature .
we are hoping that this bill will protect the beluga whale so that our children may go to the shores of the St. Lawrence and one day witness those belugas .
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) :
madam Speaker , I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague from Chicoutimi who , I am proud to say , has been involved with this project since its inception .
although this is not the first time I rise to speak in this House , I would like to take this opportunity to thank the voters of West Nova for having placed their faith in me .
i will do my utmost to bring their concerns forward during this 36 th Parliament and beyond .
it is also an honour for me to be sitting in this House with members from all regions of the country .
after only two months in this House , I have a deeper appreciation for this great country and a new respect for the diversity of our fellow citizens .
as an Acadian from St. Marys Bay , I am very proud to represent a riding where anglophones and francophones have been living together for hundreds of years , and where the sea always played a key role in the lives of its inhabitants .
our ancestors , whether English , French , Scottish , Irish or German , all lived off the fisheries in one way or another .
in 1986 the PC government approved the national marine park ' s policy .
in 1987 the country ' s first national marine conservation area known as Fathom Five in Georgian Bay was established .
in 1988 the government signed a federal - provincial agreement with the province of British Columbia to create a national marine conservation area at Gwaii Haanas in the Queen Charlotte Islands .
on April 6 , 1990 the Progressive Conservative government signed a historical and unique agreement between Canada and Quebec to create a marine park at the confluence of the Saguenay fiord and the St. Lawrence estuary .
bill C - 7 is a mirror act to bill 86 which was passed by the Quebec legislature last year .
our government also called for the creation of an additional four marine conservation areas by the year 2000 .
as my colleague from Chicoutimi will attest to , there is much work involved in establishing a marine park .
there are various components that need to be examined .
we knew that terrestrial parks brought in large numbers of tourists , and therefore it was safe to assume that there would be an influx of tourism to this community .
the first took place in December 1990 regarding the boundaries of the park .
local residents wanted a larger protected area .
the second round of public consultations to be carried out by the Progressive Conservative government was held in June 1993 to consider a development plan for the park .
we all know the more people you consult the more ideas are brought forward .
more ideas often bring more changes and it takes time to make changes to a document .
what I find dismaying is that it took the government this long to finally approve the management plan for the marine park and to bring forward this bill .
in 1994 the Canadian heritage minister of the day introduced the national marine conservation areas policy .
this was followed up by the national marine conservation areas system plan in 1995 .
this plan would divide Canada ' s three oceans and great lakes into 29 distinct marine conservation areas or NMCAs .
in typical Liberal style of environmental one - upmanship , the government set a goal for itself of establishing 10 such marine parks by the year 2000 .
to date there are three marine parks on the Canada Parks map but only Fathom Five is a legal entity .
the government must have thought it was moving too quickly on this and called an early election , effectively killing Bill C - 78 .
finally , here we are in November 1997 with Bill C - 7 , which is essentially identical to Bill C - 78 .
the clock is ticking .
as we approach the millennium we cannot afford to waste any more time in this very urgent matter .
with less than three years to go , we have yet to establish a marine park in each region , let alone the 10 parks promised by the government .
we must adopt this legislation as soon as possible .
i look forward to dealing with the specifics of the bill when it goes to committee , as well as examining the feasibility of other NMCAs .
i am very excited by the prospect of establishing other marine parks , especially in the Bay of Fundy and off the Scotian Shelf .
aside from the obvious benefits of preserving the ecological integrity of our marine life , marine parks would increase tourism and create much needed jobs for the people of my area .
i would like to share with you a small story .
in spending some time in the waters off Nova Scotia , specifically off Briar Island while doing some sailing , I have had the opportunity of seeing the majestic whales that many tourists from across the world come to see .
i see this as a perfect opportunity to protect this environment and make it better than it is at this point .
i look forward to working with this government toward achieving the main objective of the marine park , which is to preserve our marine environment for the present and future generations to enjoy .
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) :
madam Speaker , I have a question for the member in regard to the establishment of these marine parks .
there was one plan a number of years ago for my riding of Charlotte .
it was referred to as the Fundy Isles Marine Park .
it was to include areas of Campobello Island , Deer Island , Grand Manan and the surrounding area .
one of the concerns expressed at the time was the question of the marine park versus the traditional fisheries and what impact that would have on traditional fishing areas .
for example , would lobster fishermen be restricted in the areas they could trap lobster , or scallop draggers restricted ?
this collision between the park and the traditional fisheries was there .
it was a major obstacle at that time .
other matters had to be taken into consideration as well the debate between fisheries and park officials about the park concept , somewhat like the debate which is taking place this very day between the aquaculture fisheries and the traditional fisheries .
has consideration been given to that ?
and is it being debated at the local level in Nova Scotia ?
Mr. Mark Muise :
madam Speaker , the comments I made regarding looking into a marine park for the areas I described were on a preliminary basis .
the points the hon. member raises are very important .
a park could not be developed without consultations because it is another very important aspect of our economy .
without those consultations there would be dangers .
i would say very strongly that anything of that nature taking place would be as a result of consultations with all parties .
Mr. Andr 茅 Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) :
madam Speaker , let me point out that my primary reason for rising today is to thank all stakeholders in this matter .
today is indeed a wonderful day not only for myself but also for the people I have the honour of representing .
after a dozen years of efforts , work and consultations , the government finally agreed to designate land located in the heart of my riding as a national marine park .
allow me to thank the majority , if not the vast majority of my colleagues from all parties , who , so far , have supported this bill to formalize the establishment of a national marine park .
i thank them all for their valuable help in developing and then selling the project to both levels of government .
i would be remiss if I did not thank all the stakeholders in the vast region affected by the establishment of the marine park , including the municipalities that helped promote the idea of this marine park , which was probably the park that underwent the largest consultation process ever held in the country .
i also want to thank all the mayors who testified , and also the representatives of economic and environmental organizations who did the likewise to help further a project which is a model of co - operation between the various levels of government and which is the result of the positive contribution made by all the community organizations that have helped , during the past 12 years , to build the case for the establishment of this national marine park .
many investments have been made in recent years by various research centres , for analysis and research work on fauna and flora , with a view to establish the marine park .
i was elected on June 2 , 1997 because I told my fellow citizens I was not going to come here and pretend to be representing them , pretend to be upset on a daily basis .
i am here to promote issues that will benefit my region , which is severely affected by major economic problems .
we know that the action plan on the national marine park will be revealed soon .
we hope that specific measures will be announced , especially to increase as quickly as possible the number of visitors to the area .
we know that the Tadoussac - Baie - Sainte - Catherine area receives between 200,000 and 300,000 visitors .
we hope that the action plan , which will focus on economic development and the need to increase tourist traffic , will be sensitive to the needs of local communities and provide for new facilities that will accommodate a growing number of visitors to our region , especially by building in close cooperation with the Quebec government a highway between Baie - Sainte - Catherine and Petit - Saguenay so that visitors will not have to drive through Saint - Sim 茅 on to get to the fjord and the Saguenay - Lac - Saint - Jean region .
in addition , there are sites that need to be promoted and made more accessible .
i refer in particular to an extraordinary site , which is known nationally and almost all over the world , namely Cap Trinit 茅 , where the population is aging and where it is becoming increasingly difficult for people to reach the cape which is located 350 metres above sea level and which is probably one of the most unique and extraordinary observation sites in the country .
i am convinced that when the government will reveal its action plan , it will be possible at that time to provide input and suggestions for the development of infrastructures that will allow the region to benefit from increased tourist traffic .
an increased number of visitors will bring more jobs and economic development .
so this is important for the whole region .
this is obviously not a good day to engage in partisan politics .
often this work is done quietly , not always in front of the cameras , but today is indeed a great day .
i should like to point out that back then , our government had a very substantial agenda .
it was substantial environmentally with the acid rain treaty .
it was also substantial from a trade point of view with the free trade agreement , which enabled us to increase our exports to the U.S. by 140 % .
in addition , it was substantial with respect to fiscal reform , particularly with the passage of the GST , the ultimate purpose of which was to lower taxes .
i hope that the government will also be listening with a view to finalizing tax reform , so that all our constituents will benefit and see their taxes go down and their employment insurance premiums decrease , because back then - I think we must give credit where credit is due - there were reforms , there were bills introduced by a government with a vision based on structural measures , which are now helping us to control the deficit .
i am obviously very happy to take part in the vote today on this bill that , with the support of my regional constituents , I set in motion .
several ridings are affected .
i thank everyone who played a role in this wonderful project .
rest assured that , in the decades to come , we will not regret having created this national marine park , which enables us to preserve all living things in our environment , but also to promote the economic development of a region sorely in need of assistance .
Mr. Gilles - A .
i would like to remind the House that this bill was first introduced by Mr. Bouchard when he was Minister of the Environment in this House in 1990 , at the time of the " beau risque '' .
i would also remind honourable members that it is the premier of Quebec who sponsored the bill and the recent agreement between the federal and the provincial governments .
i would like to focus on our parks , particularly those in Quebec and especially this one .
Quebeckers , like all other Canadians , love the outdoors .
this park will be an important tool for tourism development in our region and an essential facility for learning about marine life in our province and especially in the beautiful Saguenay River , which is almost comparable in terms of size and water flow to the great St. Lawrence .
one interesting feature of this bill is that it was initiated by ordinary people .
local people consulted each other in order to develop this provincial asset .
local people , with the help of the provincial and federal governments , came together to create an essential facility .
most interestingly , even today the agreement signed provides that the marine park will be administered by local people .
naturally , the committee will also be composed of a federal representative , a provincial representative , as well as representatives of the surrounding municipalities and RCMs .
this new marine park - which I invite you to visit - will be not only a tourist attraction but also a protected area for fish from our ocean and our river .
like all my Bloc colleagues , I support Bill C - 7 .
Mr. Andr 茅 Harvey :
madam Speaker , I would like to point out - I think I mentioned it - that several provincial and federal ministers worked on this project in succession and that they all did a very good job .
from 1985 to 1988 , federal minister McMillan worked very hard on this project in cooperation with Mr. Lincoln , who was then Quebec ' s Minister of the Environment .
out of this came out the St. Lawrence action plan and the first millions of dollars to be invested in the national marine park project .
Mr. Bouchard worked on the project in 1990 , followed by Mr. Charest .
she put the final touches on the bill .
those are the words she used this morning to officially confirm that the project is now official .
many people worked very hard on that project and I am glad to be back in the House , if only to vote in favor of this great bill .
Mr. Clifford Lincoln ( Lac - Saint - Louis , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , immediately after my appointment as Quebec ' s Minister of the Environment in 1985 , I was visited by two young people , a young woman named L 茅 one Pippard and a young man named Bruce MacKay of Greenpeace .
this was the first time anyone spoke to me of the idea of having a Saguenay Marine Park .
l 茅 one Pippard had been monitoring and researching the beluga in the St. Lawrence from a base on 脦 le - aux - Coudres .
these two represented a broad range of people in the community , scientists and politicians who wanted a marine park in the Saguenay .
in 1988 , when the federal - provincial agreement was signed between the Conservative government of the time and the Government of Quebec , the preliminary St. Lawrence plan for 1988 - 93 earmarked $ 10 million for the establishment of the Saguenay Marine Park .
i would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate those who have been involved over the years in this undertaking of such importance , above and beyond political lines : the member for Chicoutimi , who gave it its first impetus in many ways , certainly in the political arena ; Minister Tom McMillan , of the Conservatives , who joined in and who signed the 1988 agreement with Quebec .
what is interesting about this undertaking is that it started with the signing of an agreement between a Conservative federal government and a Liberal provincial government in Quebec , and now it being finalized by a Liberal government in Ottawa and a Parti Quebecois government in Quebec .
this is , therefore , an undertaking that goes beyond party lines , that rises far above the political bickering we see , unfortunately , all too often .
it took a year for this project to come to fruition , to make the thing a reality soon with Bill C - 7 .
the Saguenay marine park is an exceptional achievement .
it is one of the first marine parks in Canada , many would say the biggest to date .
it is the result of a unique form of co - operation between two levels of government - those of Quebec and Canada - which managed to align and complement their respective , complex jurisdictions .
it took a lot of negotiations to achieve an agreement that reflects both the integrity of the jurisdictions and the idea of working together to make them complementary .
this park stands for environmental protection , conservation and most importantly education and scientific research .
the extraordinary thing , as many of my colleagues have mentioned , is that this park is the product of co - operation and perhaps the most extensive consultation done on a project in Canada for a very long time .
it was a long drawn - out process , a federal - provincial agreement that established the interdepartmental groups that pulled the project together .
in 1993 , consultation was expanded .
all the groups involved were given the basic ideas to work on in order to improve the original project , to define the context of the Saguenay marine park as well as the guidelines , the regulations and the final legislation .
in addition to the two governments involved , there was a master plan for the marine park , expressing people ' s desire to work together to develop the Saguenay fjord and the St. Lawrence estuary .
as I said , this park stands for environmental protection , public education , scientific research , and sustainable and harmonious land use .
they have been consulted and have been very much a part of the project and will continue to be along with the local communities .
one of the defining elements of the park is the constitution of a co - ordinating committee .
it is the first time in Canada that two governments have worked very closely together with their community organizations to form a co - ordinating committee which will be entrusted with the management of the park .
this in itself represents a tremendous departure from the usual stereotype where governments decide and run everything .
this will truly be a community project where the government is a partner willing to share , listen and help when necessary .
the selection of a site is not an accident .
as my colleague from Chicoutimi knows far better than I do , this is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking sites in Canada or anywhere for that matter .
it is the harbour of 54 species of vertebrates and 248 species of invertebrates .
when consultations were extended in 1993 we decided to look at the use of that park .
it is much more complicated to draw up a zoning plan for a marine park than one for land environments .
today , the management plan will include this zoning plan as well as a tourist route crossing three marine ecosystems .
this in itself is quite a challenge and shows great promise for the future of a kind of sustainable development that will make the use of this exceptional marine environment possible , to develop a tourist attraction that will greatly benefit the local economy , while at the same time incorporating a fairly strong element of public education .
this park is a model for the future .
it is a wonderful model for the future because of its composition and because of the way various community groups and interveners of all types have joined in the work in this regard .
in fact , it is in line with the recommendations made by the auditor general in his report on Canadian parks .
it follows the thrust of the famous Bow Valley study and the recommendation of the auditor general ' s report that the first requirement for any park is to ensure its ecological integrity .
the ecological integrity is the very essence , the very heart of a park .
without ecological integrity all the rest dies .
we need education and that depends on the ecological integrity of a park .
we need tourism and that depends on the proper ecological use of a park .
on June 5 , 1997 , the Government of Quebec passed Bill 86 , which legislated the establishment of this marine park .
we needed to do the same on our side .
unfortunately , the election delayed things , but today Bill C - 7 is finally before us .
i think a number of conclusions should be drawn from this project .
first , successful co - operation among all stakeholders , starting with a Conservative federal government and a Liberal government in Quebec , followed by a Liberal federal government and a PQ government in Quebec .
this instance of co - operation between the federal and provincial governments certainly was successful , positive and harmonious , with broader consultation of the public at large , including the first nations , the local population of course , as well as all sorts of other stakeholders with various qualifications , academics and scientists .
in conclusion , if we believe that in order to create a lasting society , a society that the native peoples would describe as a society composed of seven generations , which will live on long after we are gone , which will be able to preserve its natural heritage , its natural resources for more than one generation , for seven generations and more , then we must change our attitudes , our behaviours , look at things in a new way , and find new ways of preserving this natural heritage .
what could be better than a marine park to bring this about , to rally people around a constructive project , an outstanding ecological project , to add a dimension of public education , environmental awareness , particularly for future generations ?
it is an exceptional tool for promoting public awareness .
in conclusion , in a House where more often than not , whether during debate or oral question period , we listen to contradictory and conflicting arguments on an almost daily basis , how many bills are there that we all agree on ?
today we see a bill that goes beyond political disagreements , that goes beyond social conflict , and that truly unites us .
whatever our party , whatever our walk of life , we all rejoice in the creation of this outstanding ecological and tourist project .
it is therefore a unifying bill above all .
i myself have felt for many years now , well before I was even in politics and became environment minister , that the ecology was one of the most unifying elements of our society .
along with health , the ecology is something that affects us all .
when it comes to health and the environment , political partisanship , and religious and philosophical differences are laid aside .
we find our common ground through the extraordinary medium of the environment .
the bill before us today gives concrete expression to this coming together of ideas and the desire to do something together that will benefit the public , and our young people , that will serve as a example , that will contribute to sustainable development for the future , not just for ourselves , but for future generations .
indeed the environment is one of the greatest binding threads among us .
this is a concrete example of what it should be .
i rejoice in the support of all the parties in the House that have spoken warmly about this project .
i congratulate all the parties for their spirit in trying to bring about Bill C - 7 .
it is a gesture of joining together to create something which will be unique for Canada , whether we live in Quebec or beyond .
i hope all Canadians and people from around the world will come to the marine park in the Saguenay to see the wonderful ecological heritage .
i hope we will all join together to pass Bill C - 7 soon .
all the very best for the marine park in the Saguenay .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I listened with great interest to the words of my colleague , who is the chairman of the heritage committee , by the way .
he can count on our full co - operation for the speedy passage of Bill C - 7 .
i also heard messages that are quite self - explanatory .
he spoke of successful co - operation between all stakeholders .
he stated that this co - operation , and I noted the three words , was " successful , positive , harmonious '' .
i think that what is interesting in this bill is the basic lesson it is teaching us .
i remember , several years ago , the Government of Quebec wanted to acquire the Mingan Islands , which belonged to a private firm .
at that time , Mr. Trudeau , who was Prime Minister of Canada and for whom politics was always " The sky is the limit '' , had put $ 5 million on the table et we lost our bid .
on our side , we had the impression that the federal government had just robbed us of a part of our territory that was dear to us , the Mingan Islands .
Quebec is one of the provinces with the least number of national parks managed by Parks Canada , although we do have many things that are managed by Parks Canada , because we are rather protective of our territory .
i think that the lesson to be learned from this joint project that we are about to implement is that from the very beginning , the federal government and the Quebec government have respected one another and have also respected each other ' s jurisdictions under the Constitution .
at no time did the Canadian government attempt to expropriate land , and at no time did the Quebec government attempt to take over an area that is the responsibility of the Canadian government .
i believe that this is the basic lesson that we should draw from this project .
when there is mutual respect for areas of responsibility , Quebec is capable of working within the framework of existing arrangements .
but if we look back on history , each time that Quebec is rejected for what it is , as a founding nation , that it is rejected for its identity and its culture , or that an attempt is made to invade its areas of responsibility , each time that the federal government goes beyond that limit , that there is a lack of basic respect for areas of responsibility , whatever the reasons for the federal government wanting to take over a provincial area of responsibility , it is always in such a situation that Quebec reels back , jumps on the defensive and adopts a rather adversarial approach .
i would like to ask a question to my colleague .
does he not find important that the lesson we are learning here , or the experiment we are trying with Bill C - 7 , could be applied also to every area of responsibility , and that the federal government could learn to keep within its own jurisdiction ?
Mr. Clifford Lincoln :
Mr. Speaker , I can only agree that each level of government must stick to its own areas of jurisdiction and that we must co - operate in the greatest possible mutual respect .
i have always believed that , in any federal - provincial project , in any policy change , the two sides , that is the federal government and the Quebec government , must respect each other .
it should serve as a model and I hope it will for all the bills that will come before us in the future .
i fully agree with the hon. member .
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have a question or , rather , a comment for the Liberal member .
if we are to co - operate , as you pointed out , a feeling of mutual respect must prevail between the two governments .
it seems to me that seeking separation is not the way of showing we want to work together .
it is by co - operating , not by walking away , that we will achieve something .
you are welcome to comment if you wish .
Mr. Clifford Lincoln :
madam Speaker , it is by working together that we realize that we can succeed .
this bill shows that Canada is a country where people can work together , where we can have a successful partnership and where federalism can be constructive , positive and harmonious .
therefore , in this regard , I believe that Bill C - 7 is an striking example of what Canada must be , and I believe that whatever side one is on , this shows that when there is co - operation , it can work very well .
hon. Andy Mitchell ( Secretary of State ( Parks ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to have the opportunity as the Secretary of State for Parks to address this important piece of legislation .
this is my first opportunity as secretary to have legislation in this House .
i believe that when this is passed it will form an important step , an important part of what we are trying to do in this country to protect our special places .
bill C - 7 , the establishment of this park , represents some important initiatives , some important achievements .
this is the first time ever that we will have a federal - provincial marine park established in legislation and I think that is a good milestone .
it is a good accomplishment and it is something excellent that this House is moving toward .
it is moving on a broader sense to completing and working on what we hope to have one day , a national group or national plan of marine conservation areas .
i think it is an important step in protecting a very critical ecosystem in that part of the country where the St. Lawrence and the Saguenay meet and in particular , as some other members have mentioned , the protection of the beluga whale .
as was mentioned by the previous speaker , it is a good example of this government ' s working with its provincial counterparts to achieve some important objectives in this country .
as I said , this represents our achieving some very broad principles which we are dedicated to as a government .
we believe it is important that we work toward protecting our built and natural heritage , that we ensure that we can pass on , unimpaired , to future generations these special places we have in Canada .
this legislation is one step toward that important objective .
what we will be doing is honouring what happened over 100 years ago when people had the foresight to establish the first national park in Banff .
we look back to that over 100 years ago and we see how much foresight those people had when they undertook that .
i hope with the actions we are taking in this House today that 100 years from now generations will be able to look back to us and say that we shared the same foresight as the people did over 100 years ago who first began the national parks in western Canada .
it is important to note as well that we are doing this , we are providing this protection as a public trust in this country under a public mandate and to be answerable for all Canadians from coast to coast .
bill C - 7 , which establishes this marine park , is one part of an overall strategy that we are undertaking as a government , that we are undertaking as a nation , to protect our special places .
we undertake that in a large number of ways .
as I alluded , we have an extensive national park system .
indeed today we have 38 national parks .
we also protect our national historic sites .
through the Historic Sites and Monuments Board we have designated over 700 important areas in Canada as national historic sites .
parks Canada operates directly almost 130 of them .
we are able to protect and to ensure our heritage for future generations .
in addition , a number of important canals and waterways are recognized as historic and come under the mandate of Parks Canada , waterways such as the Chambly Canal in Quebec , the Rideau Canada in Ontario and the Trent - Severn Waterway near my own home riding of Parry Sound - Muskoka .
we have talked about the legislation in terms of co - operation with the provinces .
we also operate with the provinces the Canadian heritage river system .
we also work to protect our national heritage railways stations so that a very important part of our Canadian heritage , our Canadian history , will be maintained for future generations .
parks Canada works with other government departments to protect the built heritage already contained within the federal government .
i am pleased as the Secretary of State for Parks to have the opportunity to pursue a number of policies that will help us continue to do those types of things in the future and continue to protect those special places .
one commitment we have made is one that I believe is shared as a good objective by most Canadians .
i am referring to the expansion of our national parks system .
as I mentioned earlier we have 38 national parks .
we have designated 39 specific geographic areas in Canada that we would like to see a park represented within .
we have 38 parks and we are represented in 24 of them .
we are working actively in co - operation with provincial government , with territorial governments , with first nations , with other aboriginal groups and with stakeholders to expand the park system so that early in the next century we will be able to say we are represented with a national park in all 39 regions .
good progress has been made .
within the last two years we have set aside close to 60,000 square kilometres for protection .
later in this session I hope to be able to table amendments to the National Parks Act which will provide a legislative framework to achieve these accomplishments even more efficiently and with a streamlined process that will allow us to provide protection in an orderly fashion .
in terms of the work we are doing in protecting our special places , we are committed to undertake an ecological review of existing parks .
we will be proceeding with that objective in the near future .
it is important not only to look at expanding the parks system but to make sure those parks within the framework right now , the ones that exist today , are being correctly managed and correctly protected .
in terms of protecting our special places we announced in the 1996 budget the movement to a Parks Canada agency .
it will allow us to apply our resources such that we can go even further in protecting our special places .
we have held extensive consultations with Canadians to move forward with comprehensive legislation within which other marine conservation areas can be established .
our government has aggressive objectives that we hope to put in place over the next several months so that we as a nation , as Canadians , can recognize the specialness , the uniqueness of what we have .
when we had the opportunity to travel around the country we learned very quickly that we have some of the most beautiful places in the world right here in Canada .
part of our parks system is to ensure those special places are not only for the enjoyment of this generation of Canadians .
the responsibility we intend to live up to is to ensure those special places are there unimpaired for future generations to enjoy .
that is our dual mandate .
that is what we wish to accomplish and that is why we are bringing forward this type of legislation and the other tools I mentioned that will give us the ability to protect those areas for today as well as for the future .
some important principles in establishing this park with Bill C - 7 can be applied as we move forward in the future .
we in Parks Canada ensure that we work with our partners , with the provincial and territorial governments , with the first nations , aboriginal groups and stakeholders , to make sure we have a consensus and an understanding of where we want to go .
in my time as a secretary of state and in talking to Canadians from coast to coast to coast I have noticed a deep desire among Canadians to see us move forward with these programs , to see us move forward with the protection of our special places .
the establishment of this park and the establishment of other parks and other historic sites should represent an expression of public will and not government working in isolation .
that is why we took so much time , and I think appropriately so , on the consultative process .
we wanted to make sure various components within the community , such as the public at large , the commercial components or the business components , understood , appreciated and bought into the types of objectives we were trying to achieve .
the bill helps to protect a very important and fragile marine ecosystem in that part of the country .
that is the genesis of the bill .
that is why we have moved forward .
as we operate our existing parks and historic sites , and as we move forward to create more , it is important to ensure that we have an opportunity through these facilities to educate Canadians ; that we have an opportunity to provide them with recreational opportunities ; and that we an opportunity to allow Canadians to celebrate the specialness of our unique land and to celebrate the specialness of what we are .
that is important and that is part of what we do .
in conclusion , I urge the House to support the legislation , to allow it to move forward , to be passed and to come into law so we will have accomplished one more important step in protecting the nation ' s special places .
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I was very interested in the comments of the Secretary of State for Parks about this issue .
he will know it is the Reform Party position to support the bill in principle at second reading , although we have some serious concerns we want to have addressed at committee .
i wonder if it might be instructive to take a look at the current practices of Parks Canada with respect to existing parks to try to get a feeling of how this park will be treated .
now Parks Canada is suddenly coming along and saying " No , I do not think so '' .
they are trying to force negotiation when there is no place for negotiation .
let us take a look at the situation in Field , British Columbia , where there has been a decision to remove the trailer park which is very important as low income housing to people delivering services as parks employees or working in the parks .
on one side of the coin we have Parks Canada saying " We will leave you alone , but if you want to move out of the park and you want to sell your trailer to someone else , we will not give you an occupancy permit .
we will not stop you .
there is the whole situation of the Trans - Canada Highway through the Yoho area and the movement of the maintenance facility there .
i have repeatedly asked for a cost justification from Parks Canada not only as the parks critic but also as the member of Parliament for the area .
the department has not responded to me .
in answer to a question from my colleague from Yellowhead the other day the secretary of state had the audacity to say that they are not really shutting it down , but he did admit that they are ticketing pilots when they land there .
this is an issue of safety .
this strip happens to be at the confluence of three valleys .
when they fly in from Calgary past the airstrip and head up toward Lake Louise , there is another valley and very frequently a wall of weather comes down there .
i have flown to that airstrip with a pilot from Invermere who has had to land on that airstrip twice in his career because of weather conditions .
he had gone as far as Lake Louise and had to turn back rather than being able to reach Springbank , the closest airport , because the weather had closed in behind him .
would the secretary of state tell Canadians how in the world he can countenance his employees flagrantly going against a court injunction and taking action by way of ticketing and overly aggressive inspections , the equivalent of shutting down that airstrip , when the court in fact has said no ?
hon. Andy Mitchell :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member across , the critic responsible for heritage and Parks Canada .
from discussions with him I know he has a deep commitment to our national parks system and to the various other things I have talked about in terms of protecting our special places .
i am going to get to the specific point on the airstrip in a second .
however , speaking in general on the original comments made , it goes back to what I said in my speech about the fact that there are two major components that the national parks system is trying to accomplish .
yes , parks are established for the use of Canadians and we encourage that use .
that is an important mandate and stewardship which we must ensure is fulfilled .
it means that we need to find a balance between the uses that are allowed today and the uses which will ensure those facilities will be there in the future .
many of the situations the member brought forward have to do with that balance .
he mentioned cost justification and wanting to get the information .
i will undertake to get that information to the member as quickly as possible .
Mr. Yves Rocheleau ( Trois - Rivi 猫 res , BQ ) :
the Saguenay region , the Charlevoix region is undoubtedly the loveliest region of Quebec , but personally I would say the second loveliest region after the Mauricie region .
a great number of Quebeckers are familiar with that region , which is known in Quebec as Little Switzerland , with its majestic landscapes , its remarkable vistas , and also as the area where salt water reaches up to the Saguenay , where the St. Lawrence ' s freshwater ends .
it is also a region that shares many characteristics with the Mauricie , because of its river , the Saguenay River , which is a bit bigger , a bit more imposing than the Saint - Maurice River .
the Saint - Maurice River , which today is free from the logs that once cluttered it , has also become very majestic .
recently , I heard the member from Saint - Maurice in the National Assembly , who is the Deputy Speaker there , speak proudly of the attributes of the Saint - Maurice River , which can be compared to a certain extent to the wonders of the Saguenay River .
i have a question for our colleague .
we know that because of its beauty , the site that will be included in the marine park should attract numerous international visitors .
i would like to know what the input from the federal government will be .
there is one small point I would like to make , however .
all this may have been done in harmony , but the federal government ' s financial co - operation should not be referred to today as a gift .
Quebeckers will be paying $ 30 billion in taxes to Ottawa , to be redistributed , and this is part of good management .
i would like to know what part the federal government will play in attracting international visitors to enjoy this lovely site that will be developed by the whole community .
hon. Andy Mitchell :
Mr. Speaker , as the hon. member knows from the work we have done together in the House , tourism as an economic generator is important for the area from which I come .
in my riding of Parry Sound - Muskoka almost 50 % of the jobs depend on tourism .
obviously the establishment of the marine park in and by itself will help to attract individuals to that part of the country .
this federal government has made tourism one of its priorities .
we have established the Canadian Tourism Commission which works with partners such as provincial governments and tourism associations to help develop and market particular areas .
i am sure there will be opportunities through that .
there is also a regional development agency which operates in the province of Quebec which looks for partners from the local community and from the provincial government .
i am sure that with the establishment of this park we will see that type of activity take place , while always remembering the other side of that balance which is to ensure we do it in a way which protects the ecosystem and makes sure it will be there for future generations of Canadians .
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am happy to rise today to participate in the debate on second reading of Bill C - 7 .
this morning the Minister of Canadian Heritage talked about her experience with the wonders of nature in Newfoundland .
my colleague from British Columbia talked about his experience in the Rockies .
one can proudly call them national treasures .
these treasures also belong to the citizens of the world .
nations fortunate enough to be custodians of these treasures must fulfill their obligations to preserve this heritage for present and future generations .
the purpose of Bill C - 7 is to create a marine park at the confluence of the Saguenay fjord and the St. Lawrence estuary , and to conserve and manage its marine resources .
this bill represents the culmination of an agreement which was signed by the federal government and the Quebec provincial government in April 1990 .
the Quebec national assembly ratified its commitment to the establishment and maintenance of this park earlier this year in June .
its bill will come into force once the federal legislation has been enacted .
this bill is a first .
not only is this the first federal - provincial salt water marine park , it also represents the first time these two governments jointly agreed to establish a park and to co - ordinate their park activities .
under the agreement made in 1990 , the Quebec government retains the ownership over the seabed and the sub - soil resources .
the federal government maintains responsibility over matters such as navigation and fisheries .
since the agreement was signed in 1990 , the two governments have worked together on legislative mandates respecting the park , compliance strategies , emergency plans and on research and education programs to ensure the protection of the area designated for the marine park .
the level of involvement by the regional and local organizations in this whole process has shown the general support for the creation of such a park .
there has been no transfer of land in creating this park as both governments are responsible for their own jurisdiction in creating and protecting this park .
this park comprises a marine environment exclusively and measures 1,138 square kilometres .
the boundaries may be changed if both governments agree on such changes and only after the public has been consulted .
a park management plan must be tabled in Parliament within one year of the park being established .
funding for the park was provided for in the 1995 federal budget .
the federal contribution toward the development and operating costs is to total $ 20.7 million over five years .
parliament must approve all new parks and any changes to existing parks .
although the auditor general feels that this is a cumbersome process , we welcome the fact that we have to debate such changes .
our national parks system is a great source of pride for all of us .
i do not think there are too many people who have yet to visit our magnificent parks .
they provide us with a connection to nature and also give us a glimpse of our past and even our future .
the official opposition welcomes this debate and the opportunity to see that the government is held accountable for its actions dealing with our national parks .
that being said , there is some concern about the way in which this bill came before Parliament .
by the time we as parliamentarians were given the opportunity to debate this bill , the agreement to establish the park had already been in place for several years .
should there not have been some consultation with Parliament before such an agreement was entered into ?
i know that this is somewhat of a special case and that there were extensive consultations with local and regional groups in the area in which the park is to be established , but I wonder about future cases .
will the government do the same thing the next time ?
are we nothing more than a rubber stamp ?
this is the first of many future national marine conservation areas which the government set out in 1995 with its sea to sea strategy .
at present studies are under way to judge the feasibility of establishing 15 more NMCAs and another six within the next two years .
to date four areas have already been established .
what guidelines are in place to ensure that there is adequate consultation with Parliament and with the areas involved ?
even though I have some concerns with this legislation , most of them dealing with the manner in which the government approached Parliament , I wholeheartedly support this bill .
i believe it is important to live up to the agreement made at the beginning of the decade to conserve our environment , in this case our marine environment .
i would like to take a few moments to go over some of the specifics of the bill and deal with the concerns which I have .
this bill outlines four zones for managing parks resources .
there are no specific levels of protection described in this bill .
they are more clearly outlined in the 1995 management plan .
fortunately this plan goes into much greater detail concerning how these regions will be protected and available for use .
however as it is only a plan , it is subject to change quite easily .
as I alluded to earlier , a new management plan is to be tabled in Parliament a year after the park is established and is subject to review every seven years by the respective provincial and federal ministers responsible .
my concern is that the government of the day , either due to pressures from certain groups on either side of the issue or from economic pressures , may decide to make changes in the plan which may be detrimental to the park and to the organisms that the act is to protect .
another concern relates to governor in council appointments concerning the administration of federal activities within the marine park .
the minister can under the powers outlined in Bill C - 7 conduct activities to advance ecosystem knowledge and to enter into intergovernmental agreements .
the minister would have to allow for public participation and could cancel and issue permits .
if it is not the minister currently responsible , namely the Minister of Canadian Heritage , then it will be up to the cabinet to choose who is in control of this park .
on a related note , some concern also exists with respect to the regulations .
currently the two governments are working to harmonize the activities of both levels of government in this park .
this harmonization committee currently is comprised of representatives from the federal , provincial and four regional governments , the affected band council , the scientific community and a conservation group .
at present they are ensuring the goals of the management plan established in 1995 are put into place and are serving as a consultant to the respective federal and provincial minister responsible for ensuring that the strategies and methods outlined in the plan are attained .
the main concern here comes with the minister ' s power to determine the composition of this committee .
although the 1995 management plan has already established the composition , it is at the minister ' s discretion to change this composition .
my main concern deals with the accountability of the minister .
will such changes be announced or will there be some consultation with Parliament before any changes are made ?
a good portion of the bill deals with compliance issues and enforcement officers powers to control unsanctioned activities in the park , including their authority to conduct searches with and without warrants and to make arrests .
fines for individuals range from an undetermined amount for minor fines and anywhere from $ 10,000 and / or and six month jail sentence for summary convictions to $ 20,000 and / or a maximum five year jail term for indictable offences .
for corporations , the fines range from $ 100,000 to $ 500,000 for more serious infractions .
courts are also given the authority to order compensation for any remedial action necessary .
i support the general principle of this bill .
both the federal and provincial governments over the past several years have indicated that there is at the time a strong commitment to conserving this unique area .
the regulations and management plan that have been put in place appear to give this bill its teeth .
while I can understand why these two governments have proceeded this way , as it is much easier to amend management plans and regulations when not legislated into law , I do hope this practice is maintained by future governments and that adequate public consultation takes place before any changes are made .
i therefore join my colleagues on both sides of the House in supporting this bill .
Mr. Yves Rocheleau ( Trois - Rivi 猫 res , BQ ) :
we need to realize that this bill involves three regional municipalities , two on the north shore and the other on the south .
it also concerns a very particular part of the St. Lawrence , as I have said , the point at the mouth of the Saguenay where the fresh water stops and the salt water starts .
it is a region set apart by its beauty , offering some very attractive places .
there is , for example , the Manoir Richelieu , which has had a casino for a few years now .
there is also the Manoir Tadoussac , in Tadoussac , which is really beautiful .
in terms of nature itself , all along the Saguenay there are mountains , known as the Trois Soeurs , with La Trinit 茅 , L '脡 ternit 茅 and another whose name I forget .
for this reason , I was questioning the secretary of state earlier on the government ' s efforts to encourage international tourism , since its responsibility is to draw foreign visitors to Canada and hopefully to Quebec .
i do not consider the answer particularly clear , but we are counting on the past activities of Canada ' s embassies and consulates to promote the merits of Quebec abroad .
everyone knows that 80 % of the diplomatic corps coming from Canada and not Quebec - as I heard it put recently by an industrial commissioner - does not speak French .
i think we must insist that the Canadian government , with the money that comes from Quebec pockets , make a creditable and basic effort to promote this unique location as a site for international tourism .
as previously mentioned , one should point to the collective effort implied in such a project , which found its genesis locally , was the subject of public hearings , is already largely supported by the Quebec government and can now count on the co - operation of the federal government to go ahead even more efficiently .
there is now a road along the North Shore , which goes all the way up to Natashquan , the birth place of Gilles Vigneault , who composed " Gens du pays '' , the closest thing we have to a national anthem .
this area is well worth a visit .
i hope this will entice people who are listening today .
it is one of the very beautiful areas in Quebec and , for the time being in Canada ; it is aptly dubbed the Quebec Switzerland .
we know how hard the Canadian government tries to promote the Rockies , and rightly so , it is one of the most spectacular areas in Canada , if not the world .
Mr. Deepak Obhrai :
madam Speaker , I encourage the government to really promote this unique national park around the world .
i agree with the hon. member , as I mentioned in my speech , that national parks are a treasure for Canada but they are also a treasure for all human races .
we should promote this national park all across the world , through all the means that we have from our Canadian embassies , brochures and tourism listings to promote this unique heritage .
we are the custodians of this great national park for all the world .
Mrs. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :
this bill holds a special interest for me as I represent the 70,000 people of the riding of Jonqui 猫 re , which is adjacent to this unique park .
as my colleague for Rimouski - Mitis said , the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill .
indeed , more than seven years after the Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec signed an agreement to establish a marine park where the Saguenay river enters the St. Lawrence estuary , the time has finally come to pass legislation establishing that park .
i remind you that this park will include a unique feature of Quebec geography , the Saguenay fjord , where a mighty river flows .
as you know , this fjord opens onto the largest estuary in the world .
this is a place blessed with a large variety of living organisms .
there are several species of plankton and many species of fish , both fresh and salt water fish .
this area offers excellent conditions for breeding and feeding , and it is also a staging and wintering area for a number of water fowls .
as you can see , this is a special environment that should be protected .
this is the most beautiful site in our country to be .
the time to pass the marine park legislation has finally arrived .
i say " finally " because the agreement was signed on April 6 , 1990 and the local and regional communities , the environmental groups , the native peoples and the scientific community , who are all committed to improving the management and protection of the rich and varied marine resources of the area , had to wait seven years , I repeat seven years , before that agreement finally translated into something concrete .
we will recall that under this agreement both governments are committed , within their constitutional jurisdictions , to passing legislative or regulatory measures for the purpose of , and I quote :
( b ) the conservation of the marine fauna and flora , as well as maintaining the integrity of ecosystems on this territory ;
( c ) the protection of the territory and its other resources ;
( d ) the development of these resources for present and future generations ; and
( e ) the appreciation of these resources by the public .
and I am not talking about the strong pressures exerted since the 1970 s by local people - despite those in this House who would like to take the credit - for action to be taken in order to preserve the rich and diverse marine life in the Saguenay region .
it did take the Canadian government some time to respond to the will that had been unanimously expressed for a long time by the local people .
the least we can say is that this project , which required several years of discussions and negotiations between Ottawa and Quebec City before coming to a successful conclusion , is hardly the best example of an efficient federalist system because of the long negotiations , even though the local people have agreed on this since the 1970 s .
that being said , I would like to elaborate a little bit on some features of Bill C - 7 which give it a unique character and which should be used as a model by the Canadian government in its future relations with the Government of Quebec .
this is a unique agreement between the two governments and it was made possible because the federal government agreed to recognize the rights and jurisdiction of each level of government - and I insist on those words " agreed to recognize the rights and jurisdiction of each level of government '' - without trying to make its own rights prevail over those of the Government of Quebec and the people it represents , which rights are just as legitimate .
this is an example the present government , its Prime Minister and its ministers would be well advised to follow in many other sensitive matters concerning the future of Quebec and Canada .
i have to stress another feature of Bill C - 7 that reinforces its uniqueness : for the first time , the Government of Canada has agreed to participate in the establishment of a marine park without claiming in return the ownership on the seabed and the sub - soil and ground resources .
indeed , the Government of Quebec keeps its property right , but this right does not prevent the federal government from continuing to exercise its jurisdiction over navigation and fishing .
this is another fine example from which the Liberal government should draw inspiration in its relations with Quebec , and a model of respect for Quebec ' s territorial integrity that should guide the federal government in other discussions .
indeed , is it necessary to recall that , for 61 years , up until 1983 , Quebec had assumed responsibility for the administration of the whole fishing sector ?
that is a jurisdiction the federal government has encroached upon under the pretext that it would be easier to protect the resources of the Atlantic region from Ottawa .
in the last 10 years , there has been little evidence to support the federal government ' s claim to be in a better position than Quebec to protect resources .
besides , the general collapse of the groundfish stocks is a direct consequence of the federal government ' s inability to assume its mandate to protect resources .
another important part of this bill that is worth mentioning is the involvement of local representatives in the management of this new marine park .
this bill confirms the mandate of the existing joint Canada - Quebec management committee and gives an important role to local stakeholders who , as members of the coordinating committee , will be in a position to monitor the implementation of the management plan .
the composition of the coordinating committee will be as follows : one representative from each of the three RCMs concerned on the north shore , namely Charlevoix - Est , the Saguenay Fjord and Haute - C 么 te - Nord ; only one representative for the three RCMs concerned on the south shore , namely Kamouraska , Les Basques and Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup ; one representative from the scientific community ; one for the groups dedicated to the conservation and preservation of resources , environmental education and nature interpretation ; one from the Canadian heritage department ; and one from the Quebec ministry of environment and wildlife .
these local representatives will have a very important role to play , for this bill is admittedly rather sketchy concerning the conservation ethics to be observed in managing the park .
we have to refer to the management plan to learn more about the protection strategies that will be implemented .
unfortunately , we must admit this is a flaw because it is always much easier to amend a management master plan than a law .
so this master plan could be changed at any time in order to increase or reduce the protection of marine resources , in spite of all the good will expressed here today .
moreover , clause 17 of this bill authorizes the governor in council to make regulations for the protection of marine resources , for the control of activities , for the issuance of permits and for prescribing the fines for offences .
as a consequence , I believe that the stakeholders will have to be very vigilant - I repeat , very vigilant - to ensure that the application of the management master plan is consistent with the spirit of Bill C - 7 , which we are about to pass .
i am pleased to see that , in this matter , the federal government is getting involved in regional development in Quebec without bypassing the provincial government , which is very much to its credit .
it is indeed worth mentioning since , during its first term , this Liberal government had shown us another kind of approach which was a lot less respectful of the Quebec governement ' s jurisdiction in the area of regional development .
when the Liberals took office in 1993 , 62 % of federal funding for regional development came under various agreements with the Quebec government .
now , four years later , that percentage has gone down to 33 % .
this means that in more than two thirds of regional development matters in which the federal government is involved , it bypasses the Quebec government , often duplicating what is already being done .
need I remind the members that , since the creation of the Federal Office of Regional Development , the Liberal government has been using this agency almost exclusively as a propaganda tool to increase its visibility in Quebec , hiding behind that agency to get directly involved in regional development in that province .
and , unfortunately , it has been doing so without giving any consideration to the effectiveness of its interventions .
as a matter of fact , 90 % of the Federal Office of Regional Development activities duplicate the Quebec government ' s activities and , according to some estimates , this duplication is costing taxpayers $ 20.7 million .
the fact that for once the government respected Quebec ' s jurisdiction over regional development , by signing an agreement with the province , can only be cause for rejoicing .
but let us also hope that this approach will become the rule in future federal interventions in regional development in Quebec .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
Yes.
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i declare the motion carried .
this bill is therefore referred to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage .
( motion agreed to , bill read the second time and referred to a committee )

telecommunications ACT
madam Speaker , the government ' s agenda as outlined in the speech from the throne sets out the course it intends to take to ensure that Canada succeeds in the global knowledge economy of the 21 st century .
the agenda sets out clearly the actions to be taken and the partnerships to be forged to ensure that Canada realizes its potential in this new economy .
one of the first priorities is to connect Canadians .
the goal is to make Canada the most connected nation in the world , making sure that all Canadians can have access to the electronic highway and the information economy by the year 2000 .
this is perhaps the single most important action that government can take to ensure success in the knowledge based economy .
a national strategy designed to give access to the information and knowledge infrastructure will enable individuals , rural communities , and small and medium size businesses to find new opportunities to learn , communicate , trade and develop their economic and social potential .
bill C - 17 marks a major step in our strategy to connect Canadians to the information highway .
it is also a milestone in this government ' s strategy to encourage competition , innovation and growth in Canada ' s telecommunications industry , which plays a vital role in the knowledge economy and greatly contributes to the information infrastructure .
today , the telecommunications industry accounts for 115,000 quality jobs and 3.36 % of GDP .
we believe it will be one of the key growth areas in the 21 th century economy .
the purpose of Bill C - 17 is to pursue the liberalization of Canadian telecommunications , which started more than 10 years ago and has already greatly benefited Canadians and Canadian telecommunications companies .
that liberalization began with the licensing of competitive cellular telephone service and moved forward with the privatization of Teleglobe and Telesat , the introduction of competition to long distance telephone service and the passage of the new Telecommunications Act .
over the last two years , this process has been continued with the licensing of suppliers of new services , including personal communications services and local multi - point communication services .
we have also been pursuing this liberalization agenda at the international level to promote global competition and new opportunities for Canada ' s telecommunications sector .
the bill before us today paves the way to implement an international agreement that Canada concluded last February .
members may remember that the Uruguay round of the GATT trade negotiations developed new trade rules for the services sector .
these are known as the general agreements for trade and services , GATS .
last February agreement was reached to extend the GATS to cover basic telecommunications .
following successful negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organization , 69 countries including Canada concluded an agreement to liberalize basic telecommunications services .
these countries account for more than 90 % of the world ' s $ 880 billion telecommunications market .
the GATS agreement on basic telecommunications covers basic telecommunication services , including voice and data but not broadcasting .
as a result , our telecommunications companies will have more secure access to major markets such as the United States , the European Union and Japan , as well as the developing markets of Asia and Latin America .
the agreement also establishes a clear set of multilateral rules in a sector that previously had no rules .
the dispute settlement process provides the necessary safeguards to ensure that countries respect their commitments .
under the agreement , we will be making a few changes here , in Canada .
first of all , we will lift all restrictions on mobile services provided to Canadians worldwide using satellites belonging to foreign concerns .
we will put an end to Telesat ' s monopoly on fixed satellite services .
our transparent and independent regulatory and competition regimes will be maintained .
we will also put an end to Teleglobe Canada ' s monopoly on international traffic and eliminate the special ownership restrictions imposed on this company , which prohibit any investment by foreign telecommunications companies .
we will authorize foreign concerns to have full ownership of international submarine cable landing facilities in Canada .
we will , however , maintain our general foreign investment regulations to ensure that the industry remain in the hands of Canadian interests .
many of the changes we promised can be implemented by administrative means , while others require that legislation be passed .
this bill provides the legislative framework required to make these changes .
perhaps more important than these details is the overall objective to foster competition both domestically and internationally .
competition fosters innovation and innovation sparks the development of new products and services , more choice for consumers , job creation and economic growth .
over the last 10 years Canada has made major strides in liberalizing its telecommunications industry , and the benefits to consumers and businesses have been impressive .
for example , a study by the international consulting firm KPMG estimates that long distance telephone rates today are 55 % below and traffic is 67 % above what they would have been in the absence of competition in that market .
savings to consumers are in the billions of dollars .
and the benefit is not just in services .
investment in switches and related hardware is estimated to be more than $ 2 billion higher than it would have been under monopoly conditions .
our objective is to free Canada ' s telecommunications and information technology sectors to be more competitive and dynamic both at home and abroad .
it was to further this objective that we became parties to the information technology agreement last year .
about 40 economies with 90 % of the world ' s trade in information technology have endorsed that agreement .
they have agreed to eliminate tariffs on some 300 information technology products by the turn of the century .
together these two agreements have significantly opened up the global marketplace in telecommunications services and equipment , creating new opportunities for all countries .
as a result , Canadian telecommunications companies will be able to capture a larger share of the global market in telecommunications services and equipment .
the bill we are considering today will also strengthen our ability to keep pace with a rapidly changing telecommunications environment .
we will be empowering the CRTC to introduce a licensing regime to ensure that all providers of international services play by the same rules .
we are also strengthening our ability to enforce standards for telecommunications equipment .
we must pass this bill as rapidly as possible .
the agreement on basic telecommunications services takes effect January 1 , 1998 . A good number of the amendments to our regulations do not take effect before October 1 , 1998 , but the new regime must be in place before then .
one of the amendments proposed in this bill will enable the CRTC to establish a licensing regime for telecommunications service providers .
the CRTC will ensure that Canadian and foreign telecommunications providers hold licences consistent with WTO rules and Canadian regulations .
the CRTC has held public hearings on licensing and the whole issue of international services .
if the CRTC is to be able to wrap up this process and introduce the new regulations by October 1 , 1998 , the bill must be passed without delay .
the bill also amends the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act so as to repeal the provisions concerning the special ownership and other regimes related to ending Teleglobe ' s monopoly .
i wish to point out that Teleglobe approves of this initiative .
changes to the Telecommunications Act are necessary for us to meet our commitments in the area of satellites , undersea cables and international services , and also to ensure observance of other Canadian telecommunications policies .
the benefits flowing from the GATS agreement are significant .
we anticipate that Canadian businesses and consumers will gain access to a wide variety of world class telecommunications services at competitive prices .
Canadian telecom service providers will be able to penetrate new markets on an equal footing with local companies and foreign competitors .
Canadian telecom manufacturers will find a huge new demand for their state of the art products as telecom operators around the world prepare for a new global environment of open markets and competition .
Canadians want us to move quickly to realize the economic , social and cultural benefits of the knowledge based society .
international agreements like the GATS agreement lay the groundwork for us to construct this society .
we are working on a number of fronts to build .
for example , I have invited my OECD counterparts to come to Canada in the fall of 1998 for discussions to develop a global framework for electronic commerce .
electronic commerce means using advanced communications and computer technologies to do business .
its uses range from selling consumer products and services electronically to managing investments over computer networks , to transactions between major banks that involve large amounts of money and other assets .
electronic commerce is not only central to a modern knowledge based economy , it is also the foundation for future growth and job creation .
given our small domestic market and dependence on foreign trade , we must foster a domestic and international environment that is friendly to electronic commerce if we are to reap the significant trade and investment benefits it offers to Canadian firms and citizens .
the OECD Canada conference is an important step in this direction .
it ensures that we can support , participate in and influence the creation of an open , transparent , multilateral electronic commerce regime .
our hope is that this conference will set out the policy framework and implementation timetable needed to establish a stable , open and transparent environment favourable to the development of worldwide electronic commerce .
an integrated approach would allow all countries and regions to enjoy the benefits of electronic commerce while avoiding duplication of effort and the creation of new international trade barriers .
we need to do more if Canada is to be a leader in electronic commerce .
that is why the government is also working toward using electronic commerce when doing business with its own clients .
by being a model user we can encourage the private sector and other levels of government to adopt the new technologies .
as these new technologies eliminate distance they are taking us ever closer to the global village envisioned by Marshall McLuhan .
they are also creating a world in which knowledge is our most important commodity and the key to our economic performance .
by overcoming the barriers of distance these technologies are creating great opportunities for people , communities and countries that were once on the periphery , from the developing nations of Asia , Latin America and Africa to Canada ' s own rural and remote communities .
over the last four years , we have defined and implemented a information highway strategy , so that Canada can take full advantage of these technologies and so that all Canadians can have access to the information based economy .
this information highway will be Canadian and will offer Canadian products and services , but it will be open to the entire world .
it will encourage innovation , economic growth , job creation and communication throughout Canada .
our government ' s priority is to create the conditions necessary to encourage the private sector to build this information highway .
hardware and software suppliers , and designers of related contents and services are now among the fastest growing sectors in Canada .
opening up competition in the telecommunications services sector represents an important component of the Canadian strategy .
we know that the best , as well as the fastest , way to build an information based economy infrastructure is to institute an open competition policy .
for example , Canada tops the G - 7 in proportion of households with personal computers .
we have the lowest residential telephone and Internet access charges in the G - 7 .
we have the highest rate of cable television subscribers in the G - 7 .
as we build the world ' s best communications infrastructure we have also built industries that sell knowledge based goods and services around the world .
our information and communications technology industries export to more than 90 countries .
the sector is a leader in research and development , accounting for one - third of total industrial R and D in Canada .
this legislation is a necessary step toward the continuing process of liberalizing telecommunications trade worldwide .
i urge the House to act on it quickly and to secure for Canadians their entry into the global telecommunications marketplace .
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I will be speaking today to Bill C - 17 which amends two acts , the Telecommunications Act and the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act .
i will preface my remarks with the encouragement I personally take that the minister recognizes the importance of this sector and has continually put it forward as a priority for Canada .
i and my party may differ with the process to take us there but we certainly concur with the priority he places on it .
prior to my time in this House I served and worked in the telecommunications sector for many years .
i do concur that we have one of the finest communications infrastructures that we will find anywhere in the world .
i take personal pride in being a part of having shaped that in Canada today .
our telecommunications policy in Canada and that infrastructure has largely been born out of an inward looking approach to our telecommunications industry .
we have to some degree limited ownership in the past to Canadian players and Canadian content .
we have had a monopolistic approach to the development of the industry .
in the past it has served Canadians and did the job and allowed for the creation of some infrastructure , but the day we are in today is certainly different from what has been in the past .
today we are facing a greater degree of globalization and competitiveness as we have never seen before .
to continue with an approach of inward looking , restrictive type policies will only serve to restrict Canadians ' full participation in the global marketplace .
we are well equipped right now to compete in the global marketplace , a marketplace which offers an $ 880 billion industry in which Canadians are eager to participate .
the global network that is evolving around the world today has changed the way we relate .
time and distance no longer are the factors they were in the past .
our world is changing .
new agreements need to be put in place to reduce the restrictions on trade and to promote investment in this critical industry if we are to capitalize on the benefits that are available for Canadians .
speaking to this particular bill , there are some encouraging points to this bill that we have long awaited .
the reduction in foreign ownership and control requirements and the lifting of some of these requirements on submarine cables , earth stations and technologies that carry long distance telecommunications services outside of Canada are good and positive signs and things we personally endorse .
as the minister has alluded to , even the entities themselves , such as Teleglobe , embrace the opportunity to participate in the global telecommunications industry .
there are some changes required if we are to meet our trade commitments and adapt to these new realities and move away from the restrictive approach of the past .
we need stronger legislative controls which are inherent in this bill around technical standards for telecommunications equipment , both that which leaves Canada and that which comes into Canada , provided those controls are applied to telecommunications equipment and not to other equipment that may not be pertinent to the telecommunications industry .
generally we are supportive of the components within this bill that call for the elimination of the monopolies , the relaxation of foreign ownership restrictions and greater access to international markets .
however we have some concerns with this bill and I would like to speak to three of those concerns .
unfortunately these concerns are of such a grave nature that the positive aspects of the bill , which the industry and this party have been calling for for some time , are almost negated by these more detrimental aspects of the bill .
the first concern is the expansive new authority which has been given to the CRTC under this legislation , brand new licensing powers over telecommunications service providers .
the process around this licensing and how it is applied is undefined in the legislation .
there is no mention of costs or fees which may be involved in obtaining a licence .
this is another opportunity to potentially extract new revenues for the government and to further diminish the success of entrepreneurial interests in this area .
is the process impartial ?
we have no way of knowing from this legislation .
there is a clear indication that entities which exist in Canada today but do not require a licence will require one once this legislation is in place .
there is no criteria outlined for granting of licences .
some may think this is an over concern , but when we look at the CRTC ' s track record in other industries and in other areas , there is justification for concern .
it has a track record of picking winners and losers .
often those picks are justified by a nebulous public interest statement rather than clear guidelines .
this significantly greater power given to the CRTC seems to be in exactly the opposite direction of what we see in the divestiture of the monopolies and the wind down of the monopolies of Teleglobe and Telesat .
it is a trade off which is very unfortunate in the packaging of this particular bill .
we prefer a more clearly defined process if in fact licensing is even necessary , protecting impartiality in free market forces with less potential for abuse and political interference .
it may be that none of this is intended , but define the process .
build in the safeguards so that accusations cannot be made .
if that is there , it stimulates investor confidence and business development .
on the surface it might seem reasonable but I suggest that in the past this work was actually done by industry .
does the CRTC have the skills to manage and administer an operational process such as this ?
i know there is a clause in the legislation for the CRTC to be able to appoint a third party to administer this activity .
even beyond that , a greater concern on this same theme is the open ended administrative power on a go forward basis granted to the CRTC by this legislation which it can impose or as the legislation itself says , prescribe for any activity related to the provision of telecommunications services by Canadian carriers .
the CRTC can further delegate powers to a chosen third party , including one created by the commission itself .
this means that any area of the industry that the CRTC feels needs to have its administrative oversight can be subject to a third party management that the CRTC puts in place .
these two areas of undefined and extensive administrative power go far beyond what is required for increased participation by Canadians in the global communications marketplace .
our concern is that what Canadians have gained in the removal of the monopolies and greater access to international markets is more than offset by the much greater controlling powers given to the regulator here at home .
these are very serious precedents in the wrong direction , especially given the CRTC ' s track record of an expensive application process and weakly defendable subjective public interest arguments for the chosen winners and losers in the industry .
my third and final concern relates to what we believe to be the very short term nature and short sightedness of this bill .
we see within this bill the continued attempt to separate broadcasting from telecommunications but the reality is that these two technologies are undergoing a convergence at a very rapid rate .
in Canada today , broadcast information through digitization is being carried by telecom carriers .
as voice data and broadcast material is increasingly carried by telecom infrastructures , the attempt to partition broadcasting from telecommunications regulation will become increasingly cumbersome and increasingly difficult .
i believe that this attempt to continue to embrace the Broadcasting Act is really driven more by a desire to regulate what Canadians watch rather than any efficiencies in the actual distribution .
it is again CRTC censorship regarding what Canadians will have exposure to .
however because of convergence and the attempt to strip out broadcast from telecommunications within the industry , I would suggest to the minister and to the government that is going to be effectively impossible in the days ahead as these technologies move together .
there is a better approach .
the Speaker :
my colleague , of course you have quite a bit of time left in your speech but it is almost 2 o ' clock and I thought perhaps we could start with statements by members .
you will have the floor when we return to the debate .
statements BY MEMBERS
councillor FRANK MCKECHNIE
Mr. Steve Mahoney ( Mississauga West , Lib . ) :
frank immigrated to Canada from Glasgow , Scotland in 1950 .
first elected in 1958 to the former Toronto township council , he served as a Peel county councillor , town of Mississauga councillor and a member of the city of Mississauga council and region of Peel council .
widely known as the mayor of Malton , Frank was Mississauga ' s longest serving councillor and one of Canada ' s longest serving municipal politicians .
in addition to politics he was extremely active in the community , volunteering his time with a large number of organizations .
the municipal election on November 10 will be the first time in 39 years without Frank McKechnie ' s name on the ballot .
environment
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , in less than one month the government will commit Canada to legally binding targets regarding greenhouse gas emissions .
this will be done despite the following .
first , the scientific community remains divided on whether greenhouse gases do indeed cause global warming .
second , the government has failed to receive the agreement of the provinces before it goes to Kyoto .
the provinces that will enforce the emission standards must be on side before Kyoto , not after .
third , developing countries such as China , India and Mexico that will be the big contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in the future are not part of the Kyoto agreement .
clearly this is a global concern that requires all countries to be involved .
the government has had four years to prepare for Kyoto .
yet here we are less than one month away and our government still has not tabled the Canadian position or provided any documentation on the implications .
where is the leadership ?

parish OF PRINCEVILLE
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini 猫 re , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the parish of Princeville is celebrating the 150 th anniversary of its foundation this year .
in addition to generating numerous activities , this event is a perfect opportunity to become more familiar with our roots and to rediscover Quebec ' s traditional values .
as the member for Lobtini 猫 re , I wish these people some happy celebrations and I take this opportunity to congratulate the organizing committee chaired by Roger Bilodeau .
one of the highlights of the festivities was the launching of a history book .

PHARMACY AWARENESS WEEK
Mr. Joseph Volpe ( Eglinton - Lawrence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to tell the House and all Canadians that November 3 to 9 is Pharmacy Awareness Week .
various activities will take place in communities across Canada to promote the fact that pharmacists are experts on the use of medications .
this year ' s theme is " A healthy partnership - You and your pharmacist .
finding solutions together " stresses the idea that health is a shared responsibility .
pharmacists and the public are key partners in Canadian health care services .
pharmacists can also be partners with other health care groups in finding solutions to health care problems .
this week is an opportunity for all Canadians to learn how their pharmacist can help them improve their health .

environment
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan ( York North , Lib . ) :
this is not an east - west issue .
over 90 % of Albertans support meeting our greenhouse gas commitments .
here is what one Albertan had to say in the Edmonton Journal :
i am enraged by the stupidity , self - centredness and shortsightedness of our so - called leaders who are opposed to measures being taken by the federal government to curb the emission of greenhouse gases .
the dinosaurs did not die out four million years ago .
they are still huffing , puffing and snorting on the other side of the Chamber .

environment
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) :
when science becomes entangled with anti - technological ideology it takes real courage for a researcher to remain loyal to scientific principles and the scientific method of investigation .
Mediocrities and charlatans need only parrot appropriate politically correct slogans about rising oceans and parched farm lands to receive grants and to have their egos massaged by gullible mass media .
a medieval culture of hostility to objective scholarship is emerging -

peacekeeping
Mrs. Judi Longfield ( Whitby - Ajax , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , when it comes to serving the cause of fighting for freedom and justice in time of war , Canada has taken a back seat to no nation .
with its origins going back to the late 1940 s , the term peacekeeper has become synonymous with the word Canadian .
from Suez to Cypress to Yugoslavia and at times and places in between the United Nations has called on Canadians to help out , and help out they have .
tens of thousands have served in more than 40 separate peacekeeping missions around the world .
more than a hundred have lost their lives and hundreds more have been wounded .
they continue to serve as we speak .
canada and the nations around the world remain in their debt for their protection -

status OF YOUNG PEOPLE
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , year after year , throne speech after election campaign , we hear the same promise : jobs for the young workers and a better quality of life for the next generation .
but what are the facts ?
at the same time , the Liberal government insists on duplicating about a dozen programs for young people initiated by the Quebec government , even if it admits services should be rendered by the most appropriate level of government level , which is certainly not the federal level .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay :
even if the member for Bourassa thinks this is unimportant , this government ' s action should be entitled " Vicious circle " or " How the Liberals have our young people going around in circles '' .

environment
hon. Charles Caccia ( Davenport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the official opposition is prone to creating confusion and even fearmongering on climate change and the reduction of greenhouse gases .
in reality , greenhouse gas reduction means good business .
one of the first steps is to stabilize emissions in Canada by cancelling costly and perverse subsidies , by switching to natural gas wherever possible , by capping industrial emissions and putting in place a system of tradable emissions permits , by improving fuel efficiency for new vehicles , and by launching a national program aimed at energy efficiency .
these steps will make Canada a world leader in energy efficiency .
these steps will also create jobs , increase revenues and reduce costs .

fetal ALCOHOL SYNDROME
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading cause of preventable birth defects in Canada .
among other things it causes devastating neurological damage .
with an average IQ of 68 most of these children cannot function in school .
many run afoul of the law and it is estimated that half the people in jail have FAS or FAE .
yesterday the justice minister glibly suggested that this was Manitoba ' s problem .
this is everybody ' s problem .
today I challenge the Minister of Justice to meet with her provincial counterparts to amend the Mental Health Act so that a woman can be placed in a treatment facility if she wilfully consumes substances that will damage her unborn child .
this is not an abortion bill .
this is a bill to prevent children from being poisoned so that they too can have a fair chance in life .

municipal ELECTION IN VERDUN
Mr. Raymond Lavigne ( Verdun - Saint - Henri , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , last Sunday was municipal election day in Verdun - Saint - Henri .
i would like to congratulate those who won and praise their courage in running for jobs that are so very challenging .
i particularly want to congratulate our mayor , Georges Boss 茅 , who was re - elected by a wide margin as mayor of Verdun , and I would like to take this opportunity to wish him a very happy birthday one day early .
* * *
environment
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the leader of the Reform Party says that he is not convinced of the link between emissions and global warming .
perhaps the Reform Party leader also thinks that acid rain comes from ducks or trees , that smoking does not cause cancer , or that global warming is somehow related to not having an elected Senate .
would the Reform Party be happier with the greenhouse issue if it were proposed that we hang or whip people caught polluting ?
would that get its attention ?
as for the Liberals , they continue to show contempt for Canadians and for parliament by having more to say at a $ 350 a plate fund - raising dinner about their emission reduction plans than they have been willing to divulge in question period .
do we have to attach donations to our questions to get answers about Liberal policy ?
* * *
QUEBEC
hon. Sheila Finestone ( Mount Royal , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , allow me to explain the difference between real and false humiliation .
false humiliation is that claimed by separatist leaders when Jacques Villeneuve proudly displayed the Canadian flag after his racing victory .
false humiliation is what Quebeckers are told they feel when Canada ' s ambassador to France , Jacques Roy , is dubbed a political commando because he toured Quebec and spoke of the world ' s high regard for the way Canadians of all backgrounds work together to continue to build our great country .
false humiliation is what they are supposed to feel when Mr. Roy argues that Quebec has maintained a strong independent voice in this federation , which is quite different from the situation faced by many countries in the European Union .
now let me talk about real humiliation .
that is what Quebeckers are subjected to when their mean spirited leaders make them a laughing stock with small petty words .
real humiliation is when we forget why we fought as Canadians on many occasions to defend principles of tolerance and peace .
i ask the leaders of the separatist movement how the people of Quebec can be humiliated by showing -

merchant NAVY
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , two weeks ago merchant navy veterans received a very special recognition from my riding of Saint John , New Brunswick .
during Naval Week , the city invited the merchant navy veteran ' s association to fly its flag on the official city flagpole .
the merchant navy has been fighting to receive equal status in relation to other veterans .
some merchant navy veterans still cannot qualify for benefits .
as we embark upon Remembrance Week and as we get closer to Remembrance Day , I urge the government to remember the role members of the merchant navy played in bringing peace around the world and finally provide them with equal access to equal benefits .
* * *
Mr. Janko Peric ( Cambridge , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , time and again we hear from members across the floor how Canadians do not care about Quebec . Let me give an example of a company in my riding that cares .
recently COM DEV International of Cambridge , a world leader in satellite technology , together with Newbridge Networks of Kanata , announced the opening of a new company in Quebec called Spacebridge .
located in Hull , Spacebridge will create more than 200 new high tech jobs .
com DEV ' s success and the bold vision of its CEO , Val O ' Donovan , shows that Canadians outside of Quebec not only care about the province but are willing to invest in Quebec , creating good jobs for present and future generations of Quebeckers as well as for all Canadians .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , when Canadians heard about the prime minister ' s speech last night they were more interested in what he did not say than what he did say .
when the prime minister spoke about the Kyoto deal he did not rule out a gasoline tax to pay for it .
my question is very straightforward .
will the prime minister rule out any jump at the pump ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the opposition is always trying to find something to attack that does not exist .
it was all excited about a carbon tax .
we said a year ago that there was no such plan .
the minister of energy of the day , the Minister of Justice , made many statements about it .
having nothing to complain about , the opposition invents an issue and tries to make hay out of it .
i said there would be no carbon tax .
should we have an income tax increase -
the Speaker :
the hon. Leader of the Opposition .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , there is a difference between carbon taxes and gasoline taxes .
my question was not that difficult .
either the prime minister knows how he is going to pay for this Kyoto deal and he is keeping it as a Christmas present for Canadians or he does not know .
and if he does not know , he should say so .
economists have said the Kyoto deal , only 27 days away , could add up to 10 cents , 20 cents or 30 cents for a litre of gasoline .
here it is again .
do not run away , do not make excuses and do not change the subject .
will there be a jump at the pump to pay for the Kyoto deal ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , first we have to have a deal .
that is the first point .
we are going there because Canadians want us to do something about climate changes .
the Reform Party is against it .
it does not give a damn about the environment but we do on this side of the House .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , what is responsible is going and signing a treaty when you do not what is in it , you do not know what it will cost and you do not know how you will pay for it .
the Liberal political minister for Alberta was very quiet in the House yesterday but outside in the lobby she was quite talkative .
she told reporters that the Liberals have not ruled out a gasoline tax .
she even reminded Canadians that Liberals increased the gasoline tax 1.5 cents a litre several years ago .
i ask the prime minister -
an hon. member :
bingo .
the Speaker :
the Right Hon. Prime Minister .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , yes , I think we should go and play bingo .
they really do not know what we have said on that .
they attacked the Minister of Justice when they knew very well that the rules of this House did not allow her to get up in the House of Commons .
she replied to them later .
we are responsible on this side .
they are irresponsible on the other side .
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , so far the only government officials who have publicly stated the costs of the Kyoto deal are the finance minister ' s own people .
they have been quoted in the Globe and Mail that the Kyoto deal could consume any hope for budget surplus .
is the finance minister willing to run up a deficit to pay for the Kyoto deal ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as I said yesterday , it is nonsensical to speculate on a deal that has not taken place .
it is nonsensical to speculate on a series of commitments to be negotiated with a multitude of countries around the world .
it is nonsensical to speculate on negotiations which have not begun .
it is nonsensical to speculate on fundamental changes that are going to take place over great number of years in a negotiation with a great number of countries .
that is our position .
the prime minister has expressed it well .
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
we can read in the newspaper where the Americans are coming from .
we can read in the newspaper where the European community is coming from .
we cannot find out in this House where this government is coming from .
the finance minister ' s department has stated that the Kyoto deal is going to eat up the surplus of the budget .
where is the finance minister going to get the money to finance the Kyoto deal ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is this very member of Parliament who is the one who has proposed a tax increase to settle the problem of the Kyoto deal .
he is the only one who spoke about it .
as the Minister of Finance said , we have a responsibility for the protection of the environment and climate change .
these people on the other side do not feel that the world is changing or that we have international obligations .
they are still at the stage where they think the planet is flat .
* * *
drinking WATER
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government has just interfered in another area under provincial jurisdiction , drinking water .
in reading Bill C - 14 , we see that the government , under the guise of setting national standards , is trying to take complete control over drinking water .
will the Prime Minister confirm that , under the guise of setting national standards , he is going to assume complete control over the selling of drinking water , over its quality and over all related products ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , that of course is quite untrue .
what the bill does is regulate a matter entirely within federal jurisdiction ; that is to say , standards for the manufacture , sale and use of mechanisms and equipment used in connection with the transporting of drinking water .
our sole intent is to respect federal responsibilities .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Minister has indeed just confirmed that this involves all products related to drinking water .
that is in the bill , moreover .
they always have good intentions but , is it not the bottom line that , having figured out that drinking water is going to become a major economic issue , a strategic issue in the years to come , the federal government is trying to grab control of drinking water , as it has already done with telecommunications and oil ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the position expressed by the hon. member is a somewhat odd one .
is he opposed to Canadians having safe water ?
is he opposed to health standards for Canadians ?
it is very odd to find a constitutional question in all this .
i am extremely surprised and disappointed .
it is our intention to act in order to protect the health of all Canadians .
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the federal government will get involved in the area of drinking water through its health department , on the grounds that it must protect public health in Canada .
is this not an excuse for the federal government to take complete control over drinking water , thus taking over responsibilities which Quebec already exercises and which come under provincial jurisdiction ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in our actions , we have respected the jurisdiction of Quebec and of all the other provinces .
in fact , we discussed the details of this legislation with my provincial counterparts and their officials , and it is widely recognized that we took action to meet a challenge faced by every jurisdiction in Canada .
it is a federal responsibility , but we are respecting provincial jurisdiction .
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , is the Minister of Health not once again trying to pull a fast one , as in the case of raw milk cheese , by suddenly and clumsily getting involved in an area where no one in Quebec thinks he has any business , using public health as an excuse ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member should check with her colleagues in Quebec City , because we have the support of all the provinces to introduce this legislation .
we intend to proceed to protect the health of all Canadians .
* * *
the ENVIRONMENT
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the prime minister .
at a $ 350 a plate dinner last night the prime minister nixed carbon taxes as a way to reduce greenhouse gases .
unfortunately dinner goers and Canadians alike still did not get their money ' s worth .
we still do not know what positive position the government will put forward at Kyoto .
economic and scientific experts agree that solid leadership on greenhouse gas emissions can be win - win for Canada economically and environmentally .
why then will Canada not go to Kyoto prepared to provide leadership ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we will provide leadership and that is what we are talking about at this time .
as members can see , there is no agreement .
there is the Reform Party which does not want to do anything about the protection of the environment and the NDP which does not think a minute about what the cost might be .
at this moment my ministers are speaking with provincial governments because for the implementation of the Kyoto commitment which will come eventually we need the collaboration of the provinces .
the ministers will be meeting on November 16 .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the finance minister , the heritage minister and the prime minister are all on public record in support of a 20 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2005 .
in fact , this promise was front and centre in the Liberal red book , page 70 , right up there with the promise to scrap the GST .
when the government broke the GST promise , the member for Hamilton East was forced to resign .
who is going to resign over this broken promise ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will finish what I was saying .
there will be a meeting in a few days , actually the 12 th of this month , and we want to have discussions with the provinces because in Canada the federal government is not like the NDP .
we do not tell the provinces to do exactly what we want .
we want to have discussions with them to develop a consensus and have a position that will represent the interests of every part of Canada .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , last night at this fund - raising dinner the prime minister made the whopping statement that he wants Canada to get credit for selling nuclear reactors to China because he says that a country like Canada should get some recognition for helping a developing country reduce its emissions and get some credit for it .
since the prime minister holds that position , could he table in the House of Commons today the environmental assessment on which he bases that statement ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I do not need to table anything .
it is obvious that if the Chinese can use electricity produced by atomic energy , they will not have to burn coal .
one does not have to be a genius to understand that it is better to use electricity that does not pollute than electricity produced by burning coal .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , genius is a rare commodity on the government benches .
the Minister of Finance said on the weekend in an interview that when he was Liberal environment critic he was tremendously " deceived " by Rio because governments did not live up to their commitments .
i know this is a concept with which he is familiar , being the minister responsible for the GST .
the finance minister is part of a government that has held office for four of the five years since Rio .
i would like to know what his government has done to live up to those commitments .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , there is no doubt that when a number of us from this side of the House and , in fact , the current head of the Suzuki Foundation went to Rio , we put a great deal of faith in this member when he was the minister of the environment .
however , a number of promises were made that were not kept .
when we came into office we found that nothing had been done .
in fact , they had engaged in anti - rhetoric .
everything this member said he did not mean .
the Canadian people were tremendously deceived and I was too .
when the hon. member was in Rio he should have set commitments -
some hon. members :
more , more .
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Edmonton North .

RCMP INVESTIGATION
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , today the Liberal ' s top Quebec fundraiser , Pierre Corbeil , appeared in court to answer charges of criminal influence peddling .
however , questions remain for the government .
who actually leaked the government documents and lists so that Mr. Corbeil could have them ?
when we asked this question of the Prime Minister on October 9 , he said he was going to have a chat with his ethics counsellor and get him to look into it .
it is now nearly a month later .
could the Prime Minister tell us what the ethics counsellor had to say about this deal ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I talked with the ethics counsellor and he said that no minister had broken any of the guidelines .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , that may be comforting for the Prime Minister , but I do not think Canadians are going to be happy with that answer .
there are still some questions unresolved .
Canadians want to know how those confidential lists got into Pierre Corbeil ' s hands .
the ethics counsellor must report to Parliament , not just to the Prime Minister over coffee .
will the Prime Minister release a copy of the ethics counsellor ' s remarks or are we going to have to find out about the government ' s ethics at a criminal trial ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is making an attack which is based on information that is not available .
she should know that when something is in front of the courts , no minister can reply until the court has disposed of it .
it is elementary .
* * *
drinking WATER
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs .
just as Quebec is setting up a water policy , is the federal government not opening the door to confrontation through its intervention by promoting duplication and overlap , when it is not needed in the area ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
no , Mr. Speaker .
the hon. member is completely mistaken .
we prepared the bill with a view to honouring areas of provincial jurisdiction and to acting only within federal jurisdiction to achieve a national priority .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , Quebec ' s water policy has not yet been drawn up , and the minister is already defining priorities .
by getting involved in the matter of drinking water , is the federal government not taking over what Quebeckers quite rightly consider a natural resource that belongs to them ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
no , Mr. Speaker .
if the hon. member would care to read the bill , he would see that it is clear we have dealt only with matters of federal jurisdiction .
the details of the bill are clear .
provincial jurisdiction is respected .
it is up to the provinces to deal with the other matters , and I hope they will .
* * *
airports
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the RCMP has revealed that more than a dozen ground handlers at Pearson airport are in the pay of Colombian drug lords to unload smuggled cocaine .
when we asked the revenue minister last month if drug inspection officers were being pulled away from planes to fast track certain shipments , he did not answer and he did not act .
can the minister assure us today that not a single plane containing smuggled drugs has gone uninspected at Pearson airport ?
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for the opportunity to speak on two situations .
i want to congratulate customs .
just in the last five weeks Canada Customs officers have seized about $ 10 million in smuggled cocaine from Trinidad .
on Friday , as a result of the good work of customs officers , a man with two false passports and a grenade was detained and subsequently turned over to police .
this speaks to the good work that our customs officers are doing at our airports and our borders .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , let the record show that I asked the minister if any planes were not inspected .
he did not answer the question .
last month Dennis Coffey , a senior customs officer blew the whistle on lax inspection practices at Pearson airport .
instead of acting on these allegations , the minister ' s department intimidated Mr. Coffey .
while his bureaucrats were bullying Mr. Coffey , how many plane loads of cocaine were allowed to land and go uninspected at Pearson airport ?
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , once again the hon. member does not know the facts at all .
he should look at the facts and the stories that have come out about the good work that customs do .
if the member is saying that we should inspect every piece of goods that comes through the border , he should be aware that Canada does over $ 1 billion of trade .
i would need a lot of money from the finance minister to inspect every piece of goods .
we do an excellent job .
we have some of the best customs officers in the world and I am proud of the work they do .
* * *
BC MINE
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
in the BC mine issue , everyone is calling for an improved POWA to help older workers who have just lost their jobs .
only this Liberal government is turning a deaf ear .
is the minister , who has had since last week to give this matter some thought , ready to change his position and allow this request ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is completely wrong to say that this government is turning a deaf ear .
our government was the first to react to the situation of the workers who lost their jobs at the mine , the first , in late September , to put an offer of a package of up to $ 3 million in active job measures for workers on the table .
there was excellent news in the region yesterday .
there was talk of Noranda creating 350 jobs in Asbestos .
clearly , things are happening .
our government wants to help these people re - enter the job market .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
will the minister admit that , at least in the case of these older workers , what is needed is not active measures , but a form of income support that will see them through to retirement with dignity at the age of 65 ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , each government is free to decide on its course of action .
in the past , the Government of Quebec decided to intervene in the shipbuilding and clothing industries .
it did so in its capacity as the Government of Quebec and is perfectly free to do so again .
i have responsibility for certain active measure funds and that is what I am offering them .
the POWA was phased out one year ago and the workers themselves said it did not interest them unless it was improved , which would mean it was no longer the same program .

national DEFENCE
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the appointment of Judge Advocate General Brigadier - General Boutet expired on November 2 , after having been extended last spring .
Boutet was the Judge Advocate General who oversaw the worst abuses in military history in Canada .
will the defence minister confirm whether Boutet ' s contract as Judge Advocate General has been extended ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the position of the Judge Advocate General has been extended for three months .
the military justice system is going through changes and we are looking at what we want to do in the future .
we need an extra three months to do that , so an extension has been made for a three - month period .
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Judge Advocate General is responsible for the military justice system .
it was reported earlier this week that dozens of military personnel stationed at CFS Leitrim were suspected of being cocaine users and drug traffickers .
the JAG ' s investigation into these allegations was dropped because it was so badly botched .
in light of the newly leaked evidence , which the minister must have known about , why on earth has he extended the contract of the Judge Advocate General ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , once again the research of the hon. member opposite is not very good .
it is not the Judge Advocate General who investigates these matters , it is the military police .
if further evidence is brought forward , then charges will be laid .
meanwhile , we are extending the position of the Judge Advocate General - a separate issue altogether - because of the major changes being made .
we want to have a look at who is the best person to occupy that position and an additional three months is a wise move to make .

telecommunications
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Industry .
after benefiting from rate increases three times the rate of inflation , major telephone companies are yet again asking the CRTC to approve 100 % to 200 % increases , thereby jeopardizing the very concept of basic public telephone service .
does the government intend to remind the CRTC that -
the Speaker :
the Minister of Industry has the floor .
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I could not hear the whole question .
the hon. member should know that here , in Canada , we have the lowest telecommunications rates in the world , for both local and long distance calls .
i believe we have instructed the CRTC to support universal service , and this process is under way as we speak .
we will see what the CRTC ' s decision will be .

veterans AFFAIRS
Mr. Roger Gallaway ( Sarnia - Lambton , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Veterans Affairs .
this morning in this building the Merchant Navy Coalition showed how for 52 years its members have been denied housing , have been denied education and service benefits given to other veterans .
is the minister prepared to give all wartime merchant marine veterans the same benefits as other veterans ?
hon. Fred Mifflin ( Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State ( Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for a very timely question .
a little more than five years ago Bill C - 84 was passed which made merchant seamen fully eligible for all veterans benefits .
with the passage of this bill there was finally tangible recognition of the key contribution merchant seamen made to the success of the Allied victory and the freedom which we enjoy and celebrate today .

PEARSON AIRPORT
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Transport said in the House earlier this year that the full cost of settling the Pearson airport fiasco would be $ 60 million , which appears in the public accounts .
we now find another $ 97.6 million buried in the supplementary estimates for adjustments to the Toronto airport lease .
will the minister come clean , or is he just padding the Pearson payoff ?
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Transport this spring was quite categorical in saying that $ 60 million was all there would be to pay off the Pearson airport fiasco .
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I think I answered the question initially .
the fact is that this was a rather complicated agreement , a complicated deal and not all of the costs were in at the time of the announcement .

environment
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , countries around the world began initiating energy efficiency measures after Rio , creating hundreds of thousands of jobs .
other countries have used higher standards and proactive regulations to increase employment and protect the environment at the same time , a win - win situation .
my question is for the Prime Minister .
since coming to power in 1993 what has this government done to increase energy efficiency and meet global commitments beyond a voluntary registry program and a weak federal building standards program ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , a variety of initiatives are under way .
there are the self - starting initiatives that we are supporting and encouraging in the private sector , the strengthening of efficiency regulations , certain incentives to encourage greater energy efficiency in the use of renewables , the encouragement of co - generation projects , the promotion of science and technology , the fostering of a whole range of alternatives in terms of energy .
we believe that in properly dealing with the climate change challenge we can develop a truly win - win situation for Canada .
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) :
will the Minister of Finance commit today that after Kyoto he will establish a national commission consisting of an investment fund and asking leadership from governments and health , community and labour groups to recommend measures to maximize jobs and economic benefits for all Canadians ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. gentleman is quite right in saying that we have to enlist the involvement and the creativity of a broad cross - section of Canadians , indeed a broad cross - section of people around the world , to come to grips with the problem of climate change .

fisheries
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , Atlantic fishermen are being subjected to an unbearable number of fees : licence fees , inspection fees , wharfage fees and monitoring fees to name just a few .
some of these have gone from $ 30 to $ 7,000 in a single year .
my question is for the minister of fisheries .
is it the intent of the department to put these small fishermen out of business and will the minister review some of these owners ' fees with an aim to providing some relief to the fishermen in Atlantic Canada ?
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
it is very important to recognize that as part of the viability some fishermen who have in fact quite substantial incomes pay a legitimate fee for the product that they use .
for others who are smaller fishermen such as the ones referred to by the hon. member , we are constantly examining the fee impact .
there is a three year study which will start next year on the impact of it .
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am not sure the minister ' s response is going to offer much encouragement to the fishermen back home .
as we speak , fishermen are being subjected to electronic black box monitoring and on - board video surveillance .
this is akin to the electronic bracelets worn by prisoners , but at least the prisoners had a fair trial before being subjected to this humiliating and patronizing process .
what are the limits of intrusiveness and again , will the minister review some of these costs and the purposes of some of these practices ?
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , one of the important factors both internationally and domestically with the fishing fleet is to get accurate information on the stocks that are being fished in particular with respect to bycatch and other destructive practices that may be taking place .
it is therefore important to have information on catch .
however where it is possible to use technology instead of having a human observer , generally speaking costs are saved and the fishermen are dramatically advantaged as a result .

aboriginal AFFAIRS
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) :
married women living on reserve cannot get an order for a share in the matrimonial home and the land it is on and they cannot get an order for exclusive occupancy of that home when their marriage ends .
what is the minister doing to address the concerns and the rights of aboriginal women who want to protect their homes when their marriages end ?
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the First Nations Land Management Act is an important initiative that could provide more control for First Nations over their lands .
concerns have been raised over the issue and the need for a process to manage matrimonial property .
we take these concerns very seriously .
it would be my hope that we could find a solution out of court through positive discussions with all the parties .
we certainly respect the right of the B.C. Native Women ' s Society to pursue its concerns through the courts .

immigration
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) :
was it Handfield ' s years of experience in immigration law or was it his mother ' s long term service to the Liberal Party that won him his $ 85,000 a year patronage position ?
Canadians want to know .
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I can see that the hon. member from the Reform Party is not at all aware of the procedure for making appointments to the Immigration and Refugee Board .
there is a selection committee that assesses candidates and makes recommendations on appointments to the government .
in this case , in accordance with the procedure , the selection committee recommended the person be reappointed because he was qualified .

government SPENDING
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question if for the Minister of Canadian Heritage .
despite years of austerity and cuts , the propaganda budget for Canada Day and heritage celebrations has increased by 1,000 % in two years .
can the minister explain to us why she has served Quebec so well this time by giving it 56 % of the Canada Day budget ?
is it because Quebec is a distinct society , a unique society , or because it is sovereignist ?
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , first of all , I would like to thank the heritage critic for the Bloc Quebecois for her first question .
i will just point out to her that I recently read in La Presse , I think , that the budget for the Saint - Jean - Baptiste celebrations was higher than the Canada Day budget .

environment
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the health care community in Canada , including the Canadian Medical Association , the Canadian Public Health Association and I might point out to members on my far right in the Reform Party , the Alberta Medical Association , all agree that global climate change presents serious health , environmental , economic and social risks .
to protect the health of Canadians and in support of health care professionals all across the country , will the Minister of Health support a 20 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2005 ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this government recognizes that health is indeed one of the considerations that should figure in the development of environmental policy .
it is for that reason that my colleague the Minister of the Environment has engaged me along with all of our colleagues in cabinet and caucus in developing the government ' s position .
the hon. member can rest assured that when this government announces the position , it will reflect not only the best interests of Canada but health considerations as well .

trade
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
when the current Minister for International Trade was Minister of the Environment , he mismanaged Bill C - 29 resulting in the $ 350 million Ethyl Corporation lawsuit against the Canadian government .
this is one of three lawsuits against the government under chapter 11 provisions of NAFTA .
MAI expands on the scope and definition of the investor provisions of NAFTA as well as geographically expanding it to 29 OECD countries .
this exponentially increases the ability for foreign investors to sue the Canadian government -

the hon. member for Essex .
Ms. Susan Whelan :
Mr. Speaker , Canadians want to know that this government -
the Speaker :
the hon. parliamentary secretary .
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
thank you very much , Mr. Speaker .
one of the reasons for pursuing MAI is to strengthen Canada ' s position in world trade .
MAI has a great future , if we can get 29 countries together singing from the same hymn book .

science AND TECHNOLOGY
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canadians want to know that this government is building a modern , innovative economy .
what steps has the Minister of Industry taken to encourage support for innovation and risk taking in the science and technology industry in Canada ?
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I could hear the end of that question .
clearly innovation and knowledge are the keys to Canada ' s participation in a knowledge based economy of the 21 st century .
therefore we have invested in supporting research and development in the universities through the extension of the networks of centres of excellence and the $ 800 million Canada Foundation for Innovation .
we have supported research in the private sector through the Technology Partnerships Canada program .
there have been 11,000 jobs created and maintained through the extension of the industrial research and -

KREVER INQUIRY
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , Judge Horace Krever is about to make his report on November 21 and he will surely say that the federal government shares the blame in the tainted blood tragedy .
will the health minister commit that he will also share the compensation package with those victims who got hepatitis C ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I think instead of anticipating the recommendations the judge will make , it is best to await the delivery of the report .
it will be in our hands within a few weeks .
we will make it public and then we can all have a look at it and go from there .

cultural INDUSTRIES
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau ( Repentigny , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is to the Prime Minister .
we all know that the Canadian government wishes to exclude culture from the multilateral agreement on investment .
to achieve this , however , the negotiators must agree on the wording of a clause whereby cultural industries will be exempted .
is the Prime Minister willing to make a commitment to the cultural industries that their recommendations will be considered for adoption and that a clause worthy of the name providing for a general exception for cultural industries will be negotiated ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , yes , whatever the forum we have been involved in .
we have always acted to protect Canada ' s cultural industries .
we did this when NAFTA was signed and we have always done this in our multilateral negotiations , always .

child SUPPORT PAYMENTS
Ms. Diane St - Jacques ( Shefford , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is to the Minister of Justice , who was kind enough to reply to my question yesterday , even if it was directed to the Minister of National Revenue .
bill C - 41 authorizes Cabinet to establish guidelines on child support payments .
the courts refer to these when making child support orders , for instance to determine the amount to be paid to the parent with custody .
if the government has authority to establish guidelines governing orders , why are judges awarding today smaller benefits than those that were awarded after taxes under the old law ?
how can the government accept and justify such practices ?
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as I mentioned to the hon. member yesterday in response to her question , the support guidelines were enacted by the government .
in fact we believe those support guidelines will ensure that the children of divorced couples will be better off .
if the hon. member has any indication that these guidelines in any part of their application are not working well , I would be very happy to discuss it with her .

government ORDERS
telecommunications ACT
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) :
there were two changes to the broadened powers of the CRTC linked to the bill which sadly limit the benefit of the bill .
we are very concerned about the extensive increase to the powers of the CRTC .
i was also beginning to address a third concern related to the bill in that it has a very short term nature .
it is somewhat shortsighted in its application of a greater degree of competition within the industry .
the reason I say that is the bill continues to attempt to separate broadcasting regulation from telecommunications regulation .
in Canada today we are facing an increasing convergence within technology where voice , data and broadcast are all being carried over telecommunications facilities .
it is increasingly difficult to try to separate the broadcast component from the telecommunications component because of the convergence of the technologies .
as the convergence continues it will be increasingly difficult to keep these two acts separate .
therefore this piece of legislation will have a very short lifespan .
in this way we would be able to reduce the requirement of the Broadcast Act to control content .
rather than delay the inevitable and hold up the industry from being able to capture some of the gains in the telecommunications market through simplified regulation , we recommend the government take a leadership role and amalgamate the Broadcast Act and the Telecommunications Act .
it should harmonize and relax the regulations .
it should reduce rather than expand the CRTC protectionist role .
we encourage a strong Canadian product that will compete well locally and internationally .
we need regulations which will allow Canadian telecommunications interests to compete .
broadcasters must be able to provide the products Canadians wish to see rather than the products the CRTC deems we should be able to see .
if we move in this direction we will see a much greater interest by investors to step into the telecommunications marketplace .
it will also generate a substantial amount of business confidence .
in summary I will deal with some of the positive measures of the bill .
we are encouraged because several of the measures are ones the Reform Party has long been calling for such as the removal of monopoly interests and allowing for Canadian interests to fully participate in international carrier services .
another positive is the opportunity for greater competition at home when accessing long distance services within the international marketplace .
this should lead to lower rates for Canadians .
unfortunately these positives are coupled with some very significant concerns that we have .
i will list them briefly .
we are concerned that more power will be given to the CRTC , beyond what is called for by the legislation .
we are concerned about very expansive CRTC administrative power over operational concerns , which it is not equipped to manage and never has been .
we are also concerned that there is no recognition of convergence between the broadcast and the telecommunications technologies .
it is reactive to industry and technological pressure .
it does not take us into the information age as the minister so clearly likes to tell us it does .
it continues to attempt to strip out broadcasting and the regulations associated with broadcasting .
it is getting increasingly difficult to do this .
we encourage the government to address these concerns before the next reading of the bill .
then we as a House can take what is the good part and the good start that we see in the bill , improve it , keep it on track and allow the Canadian industry to become a world leader .
if members opposite and the minister will entertain these changes to the bill and will allow the increase in the controls they are calling for within the greater powers to the CRTC to be uncoupled and removed from the bill , it will strengthen the entire package .
it will also strengthen the opportunity for Canadian interests to participate fully in the global information age .
we ask the government to entertain that .
i know it would be endorsed by many of members of this party and by many other members of the House .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member for Calgary West on a question or comment .
Mr. Rob Anders :
Mr. Speaker , I have a tough question for the member for Calgary Centre .
i wonder if he could enlighten the House with regard to the CRTC -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
however , the Chair having done that , recognizes that the Bloc member who is supposed to be speaking at this time will have to be brought back into the House .
therefore the Chair is at a loss as to exactly what the Chair should be doing .
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I was surprised by the fact that 40 - minute speeches can be followed by questions and comments .
that is why I have rushed back to my seat .
first of all , I am pleased to indicate that I agree in principle with Bill C - 17 , which eliminates the two remaining monopolies in the telecommunications field , that is Teleglobe Canada and Telesat .
on the other hand , the government is using this bill to give additional regulatory powers to the CRTC , and supplementary legislative powers to the minister and the governor in council .
this second aspect is indispensable because it must be clearly understood that this liberalization of telecommunications in Canada makes Canada and Quebec - and I stress the latter , because as a result Quebec has been stripped of all power in this area - two of the countries most open to competition .
and that competition is being carried out right under the nose of a giant .
that giant is the United States , a country which makes massive use of international communications and one in which giant production companies with networks have a very strong presence .
this is why , in addition to these provisions , Quebec has supported - and the Bloc is also pleased about - the fact that , in negotiating the basic telecommunications agreement with the World Trade Organization , Canada insisted on preserving Canadian majority ownership and limiting direct and indirect foreign ownership to 46.7 % .
this then is support for the underlying principles .
however , this bill also provides an opportunity to express three major concerns , questions and proposals .
naturally , this liberalization comes with promises for business .
Teleglobe had five years to prepare to face the international competition , and the loss of its market in Canada is amply compensated by an increase in its market share in the United States , first , and then in Europe and no doubt in developing countries .
we will come back to this , if time permits .
this liberalization is therefore favourable and suits business .
as for the two other benefits that are supposed to result , namely access to WTO regulatory mechanisms - which has at times proven to be an advantage , albeit a less certain one - and promises to consumers that rates will drop as competition increases , recent events in the telephone and satellite telecommunications sectors show that this is not a sure thing .
so we invite the minister and the CRTC , who have given themselves new powers , to exercise them to ensure this liberalization , this globalization , not only benefits business , but also takes consumer interests into account .
this is the only condition that will ensure the government has the support it needs .
we are seeing a sort of revolution in the telecommunications field of the sort they went through at the end of the 19 th century with the industrial revolution .
without a minimum of targeted and well - thought - out regulation , this revolution will take place at the expense of those who can afford it the least .
fortunately , this is not the 19 th century ; therefore , while creating a favourable environment for business , the government and the CRTC will have to protect consumers and ensure access to services at affordable rates .
this is not the only question we want to raise , effectively I hope .
there is also the question of privacy .
i would like to point out right off that there is a great deal of documentation on the subject .
i will conclude with a comment , by saying that government ministers across the way have promised to introduce legislation on privacy .
but we are continuing to build this information highway that creates extreme risk conditions without giving ourselves the legislation required to ensure people ' s privacy , which may result in Canada becoming a country with which the European Union for example will not exchange confidential information , especially since it already feels that Canada does not properly protect this kind of information .
i will try to read in the most lively fashion possible excerpts from a few documents .
he said : " In Canada , the federal government and some provincial governments have established legislative frameworks setting out the principles that define the protection of personal information held by government institutions .
but , he said , the main designers and owners of the new information systems are currently consortia largely made up of private businesses .
it is these businesses which will soon - this was in 1994 , so we are there now - with the implementation of the information highway , be in possession of all sorts of information on people .
this information will circulate , it will be disseminated and spread in such a way that it may be difficult for people to protect the data relating to them '' .
yet , as interesting and useful as they are , these codes have flaws , a major one being that businesses refusing to comply with the code leave people totally unprotected '' .
Paul - Andr 茅 Comeau then cites the Quebec legislation : " In this respect , Quebec serves as a model and a beacon in North America .
the Quebec experience , still in its early stages at the time - which is no longer the case , although Quebec continues to be proud of this legislation - shows that it is possible to protect people ' s privacy and their personal information in the private sector , without adversely affecting the competitiveness of businesses and creating obligations that would prevent them from operating '' .
Paul - Andr 茅 Comeau is certainly not the only one who spoke highly of the Quebec law and who stressed the need for Canada to adopt similar legislation .
in their report , the F 茅 d 茅 ration nationale des associations de consommateurs du Qu 茅 bec and the Public Interest Advocacy Centre in Canada state that Canadians are quite concerned about the collection and use of personal information .
people feel there is less control over personal information .
Canadians are particularly concerned by the transmission of personal information between various organizations , especially private businesses .
consumers want to know and control how their personal information is being used .
the technological changes must not impose a new burden on individuals seeking to protect their privacy .
why am I raising this issue in the context of the legislation on Teleglobe and Telesat ?
because it is precisely through this information highway , through the Internet and the Intranet , through old - fashioned telephone lines and numerous new means of telecommunications , that information about people ' s private lives may be collected in the form of data banks that , if not protected , can seriously compromise people ' s privacy .
naturally , businessmen are doing business and are concerned with maximizing their companies ' competitiveness .
but the role of the Quebec National Assembly and of the House of Commons of Canada is to take account of these concerns , to have a vision , to know to what extent this information highway is transmitting data in Canada through Quebec and towards other countries , to what extent this electronic highway , this series of networks requires that a way be found to protect confidential information .
i would like to add that at the level of the OECD , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , there is a great concern for another related issue , and that is to ensure that Internet can be used to safely conduct business .
it is of course extremely important to find means to ensure reliability .
otherwise , Internet will not develop to meet all the expectations it is giving rise to today .
but the same thing can be said about the protection of personal information .
it must be remembered that when the Internet is used , there are always traces of these operations .
these traces are numerous and varied on all existing systems .
this report stated , last spring :
throughout the country , people are calling for a comprehensive and uniform package of rules to protect personal information .
the scope of this legislation should be as wide as possible .
therefore , this committee believes that it should apply to Parliament and also all federal government departments , agencies , crown corporations , boards , commissions and government institutions and to the federally regulated private sector .
the participants at our public discussions stated repeatedly that the voluntary application of codes of practice for the protection of personal information does not work .
the committee recommended that the Government of Canada introduce new legislation that would replace the current act .
this legislation would comply with the requirements of the Canadian Charter of Privacy Rights and would apply to all departments and also to all the industries and companies subject to the act .
this legislation should be enacted by the year 2000 .
i would like to add this little part that I find very important :
as we are advancing on the information highway , most of our daily activities leave an electronic trail that many data banks can register .
it is obvious that current legislation in Canada is inadequate and that this situation also affects Quebec citizens in their international relations .
an important player also added his voice to all these concerns , and this is the Privacy Commissioner , Mr. Bruce Phillips , who , in his 1996 - 97 annual report , reminded us of the promise made by the then Minister of Justice that legislation would be introduced to protect privacy in a concrete and binding manner in the private sector .
he stated " The Commission has been calling for such an initiative for a long time '' , and he added , referring to the report by the hon. member for Mount Royal , " that the committee devoted almost a full year to the review of the impacts on privacy of new technologies '' .
i could continue , but I believe that this act provides the opportunity to state clearly that further development of the information highway can only be welcomed if we succeed in implementing ways to protect privacy .
as I said , the introduction of this bill affords an occasion not only to rejoice that a number of businesses are being given the opportunity to be competitive not only in Canada but on the world market as well , but also - and I will word it this way - the market and the competition alone , I repeat , the market and the competition alone , are not sufficient to ensure access for all at a reasonable price , as two recent examples have shown : the telephone situation and the bankruptcy of Alphastar .
the minister , the government , the CRTC , cannot do otherwise than to listen to businesses .
i understand this , because we are aware that , on the world scale , the biggest Quebec companies are only middle - sized or sometimes even smaller .
so , yes , businesses need to grow and this brings considerable challenges .
it is impossible , however , to believe that our businesses ' competitiveness comes solely from the pockets of consumers , and often from the most disadvantaged among them .
we must therefore continue to make telecommunications services available , and to increase access to them .
this bears repeating .
international services , and all other telecommunications services , must be not only accessible , but also affordable .
they must be affordable .
the minister , the CRTC , the government and the governor in council must face up to their responsibility for issuing operating licences to businesses that could not be economically viable .
you will realize I am referring to the experience with Alphastar , which I shall return to in a moment .
my understanding is that these provisions will prevent a repeat of something like Alphastar .
i will take the liberty of pointing out that telephone companies denied by the CRTC the increased revenues resulting from the rate increases they sought won their case with the government , which , rather than doing what the CRTC asked , that is , reducing long distance rates , let them keep the whole amount .
we might think there was talk of investments .
what the hon. member asked , and this is absolutely indispensable , is that while a competitive market should be allowed , companies interested in providing services should all be subject to the same regulations and requirements .
in the spring , our former critic who will have the floor after me , was already saying that telephone costs should not be increased until it was demonstrated that such a measure would not change the meaning of basic telephone services .
current rates are taking us away from the basic rate .
what I am about to say is true in the case of small and medium size businesses , which won their case but could still be subject to rate increases , but it is even more true for low and very low income people .
the telephone can be considered as something so indispensable that if people ' s income is reduced , some will go so far as to deprive their children of food to keep their telephone .
so , when considering what a basic telephone service is , it is not possible to keep talking about increases strictly in the context of national and international competition .
yes , it is important for businesses to have conditions that will help them , but this is impossible .
we must look at the overall picture , and it cannot be done .
as I said earlier , I am pleased to see that the government wants to create a fund to subsidize , if need be , regions where costs would be greater , so that a basic communication service , including not only telephone but also basic telecommunications services , would be maintained .
it is essential , again , so that the population will know , that such " economic modernization " not be undertaken at their expense .
why should we want to compete in Europe ?
why should the government say " I am allowing businesses to compete in the United States and Europe '' , if this results in penalizing the average consumer or the consumer with a small income ?
this is the issue that parliamentarians , the House of Commons , the National Assembly must address .
also , when things like the Alphastar case are involved , the government cannot stand idly by and let the market make the rules .
satellite communications today are still considered important because there are areas in Quebec that do not have access to cable and where there are no digital telephone lines .
therefore , they do not have access to Internet and cannot rely on communications that elsewhere are basic commodities .
there are self - employed workers and also small businesses who depend on these .
it is always possible for them to be connected , but then they have to pay long distance charges , and this makes no sense .
the result was , as observers had foreseen , that Alphastar , which had 6,000 subscribers in Canada , went bankrupt .
people were left with lovely dishes with which they could decorate their gardens , but which had cost them hundreds of dollars , and also with subscriptions that also cost them hundred of dollars and which are now useless .
the market cannot ensure fairness in all cases , and in this case , consumer protection required that there be basic safeguards .
with this bill , the government is creating appropriate mechanisms and we sincerely hope that it will use them .
finally , there is another grave concern that I would like to address in relation to this bill .
i just spoke about the lack of powers in Quebec in the area of broadcasting and telecommunications .
i think it is worthwhile to take a few minutes of my colleague ' s precious time to go over this .
we are always well advised to ensure that our colleagues better understand Quebec , of which they often get tired , but whose demands are always based on the fact that Quebec is a people and a nation .
binational countries are rare in this world , and many of them have not succeeded in holding together - binational or trinational if we consider first nations , as we should .
i would like to remind you that communications are a field that Quebec claimed very early , I would say from the very beginning , when it first appeared , and it was not a bad separatist who did so , at the time .
liberal premier Taschereau , who was no doubt a federalist , a staunch federalist , claimed exclusive jurisdiction over broadcasting and wanted Quebec to operate its own radio stations .
this eventually lead to the creation of Radio Quebec .
around the same time , in Canada , there was a royal commission on radio broadcasting , the Aird Commission .
it tabled its report in the fall of 1929 and recommended that exclusive jurisdiction over radio broadcasting be given to the central government .
its model was based on the BBC , a publicly owned network .
who was asked to settle the issue ?
the supreme court , in 1931 .
what do you think it decided ?
radio Quebec was born .
in September 1973 , Robert Bourassa , a Liberal premier , and more of a federalist than Duplessis , said shortly after being elected :
in cultural matters , the decision making centres we need for our own cultural security will have to be transferred , particularly in the telecommunications sector .
here again , it is a simple matter of common sense , because we cannot leave it to an anglophone majority to ensure the cultural security of a francophone minority .
that was what Robert Bourassa said .
jean - Paul L ' Allier , his Minister of Communications , said :
it is up to Quebec in the first instance to develop a global communications policy .
this policy is indissociable from the development of its education system , its culture and everything that comes under Quebec ' s domain .
there was nothing in Meech or Charlottetown on this issue , but it continued to be discussed .
in 1994 , we know that the supreme court ruled against Quebec with respect to telephone services and the R 茅 gie des t 茅 l 茅 communications du Qu 茅 bec ceased to exist .
i mention this today because the information highway , this telecommunications revolution , is drawing the highway ever closer to its contents .
if the medium is the message , what can we say about the present information highway and the relationship between the road and what travels on it , roads that are closed and small roads that are open ?
to recap , we agree in principle with this bill , which will end monopolies .
we are all the more in agreement because the government is giving the CRTC , the governor in council and itself greater regulatory powers to ensure that there are controls over how this liberalization takes place .
however , this bill is an opportunity for us to insist , and we are going to keep coming back to this , that there be legislation to protect personal information , in order to assure consumers that this liberalization that is supposed to provide the necessary conditions for businesses to position themselves on the market does not come about at the expense of those at the low end of the wage scale and of outlying regions , or take consumers for a ride , as happened in the case of Alphastar .
finally , it is an opportunity for Quebec to say that it will need this jurisdiction for its culture , and the only way we have found to advance this to date is by seeking our sovereignty .
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , unlike my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois , the NDP is opposed to Bill C - 17 .
we do not even favour the bill in principle .
we are flatly opposed to this bill , the intent of which is to implement the general agreement on trade and services , GATS as it is known , and the agreement on basic telecommunications .
the reason we are opposed to the bill is that Bill C - 17 is part of the process of completing the free trade agreements and the implementation of the regulations of free trade .
in 1997 we are still speaking in opposition to these trade agreements .
it is worth taking a few moments to look at the context of Bill C - 17 and the history of these free trade agreements .
the trade agreements of the last decade , if we look at the overall results , have made it easier for corporations to increase their profits and harder for workers to keep their wages and benefits .
the impact of this is reflected in Statistics Canada reports .
corporate profits have increased dramatically , while real family income has declined and masses of jobs lost in this country .
the reality is that deals like the Canada - U.S. Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement encourage corporations to go where wages and benefits are lower and where environmental regulations are weaker .
these agreements are designed to increase the mobility of capital and goods , making it easier for corporations and the wealthy to avoid paying taxes .
in other words , these deals are designed to push down Canadian wages and social programs like medicare , environmental protection , safety and labour standards and the revenue from taxes to pay for our desperately needed public services .
ten years ago when the FTA was signed the Canadian people heard promises of the jobs that would abound .
we heard the promises of greater prosperity for Canada and for Canadians that would result from increased trade .
we heard promises of better social programs and unimpaired Canadian sovereignty .
all these promises stand revealed today as nothing but a fraud .
we only have to look at the facts to see what free trade has meant a decade later .
it has been a disaster for Canada and for Canadian families .
since Canada entered into free trade agreements , we have experienced the longest period of sustained high unemployment and the worst social and economic conditions since the 1930 s .
that is in stark contrast to the promises and the issues that were held out as being the things which would change our economy since the advent of these agreements .
Canadians have experienced 84 straight months of unemployment at 9 % or more .
what kind of record is that under these free trade deals ?
we have seen the disappearance of 100,000 direct jobs in the public sector .
we have seen the decline in labour force participation , which has fallen from 67.5 % prior to the recession to less than 65 % today .
that is equivalent to the loss of 700,000 jobs .
if we included these discouraged workers in the official tallies of unemployment , it would bring our unemployment rate to something around 13 % .
more than that , we have had an appalling crisis for young people , whose participation rate has plummeted from 70 % before the recession to barely 60 % today .
if we included the young people who have also been discouraged , then the official unemployment rate would almost double for young people , going from 16.5 % to 30 % .
what we have witnessed is the declining quality of jobs in the Canadian economy with the NAFTA and a growing emphasis on part time work and low wage jobs .
even our unemployment benefits , which used to cover 87 % of Canadians who were jobless , are now going to only about 40 % of people who are unemployed , and 25 % of Canada ' s manufacturing base was wiped out in the first three years after signing the FTA .
that is the real story of -
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i understand that Bill C - 17 , an act to amend the Telecommunications Act and the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act , is what we are debating this afternoon .
i would ask for your guidance that we debate on that subject .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Chair was following the hon. member very closely .
the hon. member was debating telecommunications , its relevance to free trade and the effect of this bill on the implementation of free trade .
the Chair would consider the debate to be relevant .
Ms. Libby Davies :
Mr. Speaker , thank you for those words .
in fact , the background of the free trade agreement is very relevant to the bill before us today .
in my discussion I will be moving right into the bill itself .
the point that we wish to emphasize is that the real story of the NAFTA , when we look at this bill , has not been a success for the Canadian people .
going to the background of the bill before us today , we know that on February 15 of this year at the World Trade Organization Canada and 68 other countries concluded a multilateral agreement to liberalize trade and investment in telecommunications services .
the GATS agreement on basic telecommunications followed the conclusion of the information technology agreement which liberalized trade in information technology equipment .
under the GATS the federal government has said that it is committed to eliminating the two remaining areas now closed to competition , overseas telephone service and fixed satellite services .
as a result , Teleglobe ' s monopoly will end on October 1 , 1998 and Telesat ' s monopoly will end on March 1 , 2000 .
canada , as part of this agreement , has also agreed to remove foreign ownership restrictions in satellite earth stations and the landing of international submarine cables .
the key elements of Canada ' s offer under the GATS agreement on basic telecommunications are the elimination of the remaining monopolies of Teleglobe and Telesat , the liberalization of traffic routing restrictions , the elimination of minimum Canadian equity requirements for mobile satellite systems , the elimination of the special foreign ownership limits applicable to Teleglobe Canada , the elimination of the foreign ownership limits for international submarine cables and the adoption of a regulatory reference paper which sets out principles of regulations for all the signatory countries .
what is the government ' s position on this ?
we have been told by the industry minister that the changes contemplated in the bill before the House today , along with the GATT agreement , will lead to increased business opportunities for Canada ' s telecommunications industry at home and abroad .
we are told that Canada ' s telecommunications firms will have easier access to a more competitive international market and will capture a larger share of the $ 880 billion global telecommunications industry .
those are the same old arguments that were put before the people of Canada under FTA and under NAFTA .
i would suggest that what we are really experiencing , instead of the benefits that we have been told that we will get , is the Americanization of all aspects of Canadian life as a result of these trade deals and now as a result of this bill if it is passed by the House .
i would like to spend a moment to look at what that experience has been for some Canadian companies .
think about the company CN , the railroad which once linked our country together and pioneered public broadcasting and our national airline .
what happened to that company ?
it was sacrificed as a result of free trade .
CN was sold for half of what it was worth and it is now owned 70 % by Americans .
all of the lines of northern Manitoba , including the port of Churchill plus two Saskatchewan lines , have been sold to Omnitrax of Denver , U.S.A.
it is now virtually impossible for Canadians to buy Canadian if they want to do so because whole sectors of our economy , such as pulp and paper and advertising , have been taken over by U.S. corporations .
now we are facing the same thing in the bill that is before us today .
that is the real history of free trade .
regrettably , we all know that unless there is massive opposition by the public that the Liberals are prepared to sign the multilateral agreement on investment .
they will be egged on to do so by the Reform and the Conservative parties , pushed and aided by corporations and their CEOs , to whom these parties are best friends .
it is absolutely necessary that these trade agreements and the bill that is before us today be advanced in terms of the public interest and not just corporate interests .
we should be working for trade agreements that will help Canadian families and will include the introduction of real , enforceable and progressive social , labour and environmental standards .
we need to be working for stricter measures to prevent corporate tax evasion and stronger financial reporting requirements for large corporations that are not publicly traded .
the government should be working with its trading partners to develop international standards for taxation of income from capital to counter tax avoidance and evasion by corporations and the super wealthy .
that is what the government should be focusing on instead of opening up the flood gates and saying that under trade liberalization that we are going to somehow benefit .
the contrary is true .
we also need the introduction of an international tax to control speculative currency trading .
in recent years , such speculation has undermined some national economies , forcing up interest rates and throwing people out of work .
i challenge the House of Commons and this Liberal government to protect the interests of ordinary working Canadians when signing any further trade agreements .
it is time we had agreements that worked for Canada and Canadians , not against them .
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is obvious to anybody who has any understanding at all about how jobs are created or who has had any contact with business that deregulating these government monopolies contributes to tremendous levels of employment and helps people get jobs .
i was in the telecommunications industry prior to becoming a member of Parliament and experienced the deregulation of the telephone and telex systems which were partially under the CRTC and Teleglobe in the early 1980 s .
the expansion of the telecommunications industry as a result is phenomenal .
northern Telecom expanded dramatically and the telecommunications industry worldwide has grown and created huge numbers of jobs as a result of deregulation and of NAFTA .
in addition to that , anyone who has been in business or understands how jobs are created knows it is high taxation that causes unemployment , that has caused our 83 months of unemployment , not deregulation of government monopolies .
it is high taxation , over - government regulation and government overspending .
if government spending could create jobs - it has already overspent by $ 600 billion - we should have three jobs each by now .
it is totally ludicrous to blame deregulation for high unemployment .
it does not make sense to anybody who really thinks about the situation .
if the member thinks that NAFTA is a disaster , what could she say to the people in my riding like Mr. Hans Gawenda or Mr. Peter Belding ?
like dozens of other small businesspeople , they have expanded their businesses up to 50 employees and more from just one or two because NAFTA allowed them to do business in the United States , to get rid of all the tariffs that prevented them from assembling products in Canada ?
some old , worn out , tired , oversubsidized industries went out of action , such as the shipbuilding industry in my riding that never could compete , but in its place are thousands of new jobs in these deregulated industries , in these new industries available through NAFTA .
how does the hon. member rationalize her position with the facts ?
Ms. Libby Davies :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question .
clearly we have a strong difference of opinion on the effect of trade liberalization on Canadians , Canadian jobs and Canadian companies .
i argue very strongly that deregulation is part of a global agenda that is driving us in a direction where larger corporations , multinational corporations , transnational corporations are gaining greater control .
the overall effect of that has not been to create jobs .
we are in favour of fair competition .
we are in favour of regulation that sets a level playing field .
MAI and these trade liberalization agreements are about corporate rule .
they are about giving more power to corporations and driving down wages , ensuring that basically there are no environmental standards left .
if the member is arguing that is good for his constituents , I would argue the opposite .
canada has had a long tradition in the shipbuilding industry in the province of British Columbia , in the member ' s riding and in my riding of Vancouver East .
we want to see a government committed to industrial infrastructure and to manufacturing .
we have all kinds of workers with the skills and knowledge to create a shipbuilding industry who have been dumped out of work through agreements like NAFTA , the FTA and now the MAI .
the facts show a different story in terms of what has happened in our economy .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wonder how a tax , as the NDP member has termed it , on currency trading creates jobs .
investment and growth in the economy are what creates jobs .
but restricting Canada ' s access to capital markets and to currency does not .
is she possibly proposing that Canada move to a gold standard rather than having a free floating currency ?
how does the free flow of capital stimulate investment and create jobs ?
Ms. Libby Davies :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question .
part of the problem we are witnessing is that with agreements like NAFTA and now the MAI there will be no rules about the movement of capital around the world where huge profits are being made .
there is more than enough evidence to show that very large corporations are making record profits at the expense of jobs .
there needs to be in the context of a globalized economy some international institutions and structures that have the ability to ensure that windfall profits are recouped for public benefit .
if the member cannot understand that and understand that we are talking about a matter of financial and social equity , then I guess we have a very different view of how things should operate .
we in the NDP see that under the trade liberalization we are transferring power to very powerful corporations that have absolutely no accountability .
there are some very undemocratic organizations .
who are they accountable to ?
not to governments , not to the people of Canada or any country .
the very real issue is whether they are creating jobs in the long run .
there is a small percentage of people who are making enormous profits at the expense of millions of ordinary people , workers who are getting low wages or people who have been thrown out of work .
that is why we need to have a fair and open system where we can ensure that windfall profits are properly taxed .
Mr. Rob Anders :
Mr. Speaker , I asked the question and , indeed , a lack of understanding of economics was proven by the member from the NDP .
i have done a fair amount of trading and as far as I know the markets , if Canada were to go ahead and create a tax on currency trading unilaterally , we could be guaranteed there would be a sucking sound which would be the capital leaving this country .
or capital may never come into the country again .
by proposing that we tax these transactions , the member is actually encouraging the driving out of capital .
i just do not understand how that would create jobs .
obviously in the member ' s fantasy world the economy has orange skies if she believes that this may work in creating jobs .
it will not .
Ms. Libby Davies :
Mr. Speaker , it is really unfortunate that the member would dismiss another point of view and other arguments as somehow being a fantasy .
if the member would listen closely to what really is now developing as a huge concern for Canadians about the impact of trade liberalization , then the member would not be so quick to judge that these concerns are somehow a fantasy or should not be taken seriously .
second , if the member had been listening closely he would have heard that what was being advanced in our comments on the bill was the need for international institutions that have the ability to also provide regulations .
we are facing globalization .
therefore , the issue before us is how to ensure that there is a level playing field and that Canadians do not lose out in the short run as well as the long run .
the member needs to listen carefully to what is actually being put forward .
Mr. Rob Anders :
Mr. Speaker , if Canada was unilaterally to go ahead and act against currency trading or if there were to be a multinational universal agreement in terms of taxing currency trading , all we would be doing is regulating it to death .
what would be the point of even having a floating currency ?
the hon. member for the NDP should suggest a fixed currency in terms of a gold standard , for example , rather than suggest that somehow the multilateral agreement should end it .
it is not that I support it necessarily but then at least it could be credibly argued from her point of view .
Ms. Libby Davies :
Mr. Speaker , very briefly I think it comes down to a question of priorities .
the priority for the NDP is to ensure that Canadians have good jobs .
we have seen a drastic decline in that regard under the Liberal government .
what the Reform Party has offered in that regard has been no different from that offered by the Liberal Party .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
it is my duty , pursuant to Standing Order 38 , to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Delta - South Richmond , Mefloquine ; the hon. member for Burnaby - Douglas , Foreign Aid ; the hon. member for Brandon - Souris , Fisheries ; and the hon. member for Frontenac - Megantic , Program for Older Worker Adjustment .
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to say that the PC caucus will be supporting the legislation .
we see it as a way to prove to the rest of the world that we can be competitive , can create jobs and can do it through a free trade agreement .
i am amazed that the NDP caucus still fights against the free trade agreement .
i guess it is not as changeable as the Liberal Party and the Government of Canada are today .
it was to be terrible for Canada .
at least the Liberals had sense enough to realize that it was good for Canada .
they have been building on it ever since .
the NDP is consistent in its opposition even when it is a good idea .
i will be sharing my brief time with the member for Compton - Stanstead .
bill C - 17 amends the Telecommunications Act and the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act in keeping with our obligations to liberalize basic international telecommunications services under the GATS , an agreement which Canada signed this past February .
under the terms of the GATS , Canada agreed to end monopolies held in the area of overseas telephone services and fixed satellite services .
canada also agreed to eliminate restrictions on foreign ownership in satellite earth stations and the laying of international submarine cables .
bill C - 17 ensures that Canada fulfils these obligations .
bill C - 17 empowers the CRTC to contract out the need for a telecommunications numbering service and overseeing the collection and distribution of local subsidies .
bill C - 17 also clarifies the Telecommunications Act with respect to the role of Industry Canada in the certification and inspection of telecommunications equipment for use in Canada .
in order to protect the integrity of our telecommunications system under the bill non - certified equipment cannot be used in Canada .
the bill also gives Industry Canada powers to set technical standards , inspect equipment and enforce penalties for those selling non - standard equipment within Canada .
the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act is amended by repealing the provisions that create a monopoly environment in Teleglobe Canada .
it opens up the telecommunications market between Canada and the rest of the world , allowing other providers the opportunity to provide services within Canada .
this is expected to result in cheaper long distance rates due to increased competition .
the opening up of the telecommunications industry is a policy of the Progressive Conservative Party which began in 1987 when we privatized Teleglobe Canada .
after a few years of functioning as a private sector business Teleglobe ' s management decided to expand its operations .
in 1995 it recognized that its future was in servicing foreign markets and it proceeded to do so .
now two years later it has increased its share of telecommunications carrier services between several non - Canadian destinations by over threefold .
when the PC Party began privatizing many crown corporations federal Liberal Party members in particular fought against the plans .
they believed we would lose our identity in the process but are now expanding on the achievements of our party by further opening up markets and allowing non - Canadian carriers access to our telecommunications sector .
is it not odd how they have changed ?
when we privatized Telesat Canada the official opposition of the day also fought against our plans , stating that it needed all the government support it could muster to challenge the world in the face of global competition .
reformers have gone now from advocating interference to opting for a freer marketplace .
with the FTA and the North American Free Trade Agreement the PC Party further liberalized trade in telecommunications for Canadian businesses .
the official opposition of the day also fought against these .
they now stand as avid free traders , signing the GATS and extending the North American Free Trade Agreement .
our obligations under the GATS mean that Teleglobe Canada will relinquish its exclusive access to the Canadian market as of October 1 , 1998 . Telesat ' s monopoly will end on March 1 , 2000 .
therefore current ownership restrictions have to be removed from the Telecommunications Act .
our caucus supports the GATS because it is a free trade agreement .
we continue to support the principle of free trade .
the relinquishing of Teleglobe Canada ' s exclusive rights to the Canadian market has led the U.S. to open up access to its market , which is what we thought would happen in the beginning .
canada also benefits from greater access to European and other developing nations .
furthermore , as I stated earlier , the consumer will be rewarded with the possibility of cheaper long distance rates due to increased competition in the marketplace .
when the Telesat divestiture act was being debated it was argued that the 10 - year monopoly was not enough ; it had to be longer .
the government now realizes the 10 years was more than enough .
after 8 years we are debating the opening of the marketplace .
industry wants less control in exchange for open access to the rest of the world .
that is really the principle of the free trade agreement .
it will not grow without these changes and the government has finally recognized it .
the PC Party is supporting the legislation because it continues the process we started of enhancing the competitiveness of Canadian firms .
it is because of our initiatives that Canadians enjoy the great degree of prosperity we have today .
our evolutionary approach has produced well positioned Canadian companies that are today strong enough to compete globally .
we support them in their continued efforts .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I should like to make some comments with regard to the Tory member who just spoke .
those oh so avid free trading Tories are the ones who brought us the GST , the ones who did not eliminate the interprovincial barriers to trade or make significant steps to that effect .
my comments are not strictly reserved for them .
they are also directed to the Liberals across the way .
i will say in the NDP ' s defence that it was against free trade then and is against free trade now .
the Liberals have flip flopped all over on the issue .
now they are continuing it , promoting it and extending it .
those Tories , those free marketeers , what a joke .
they failed to do so . Shame on them .
why do the Tories across the way not talk about their record in terms of regulation and spending ?
Mr. Charlie Power :
they stand and criticize the Liberals .
they criticize NDP members for opposing the free trade legislation because they think they will build fences around Canada .
the Tories opened up Canada to the world .
we showed the world we could compete in telecommunications and in many other sectors , but now the only people who know anything about managing Canada ' s economy are the righteous Reformers .
they have a long way to go before they can do some of the good things the Conservative Party did for Canada .
nobody liked free trade .
however , anybody who looks back in an historical unbiased way will say that both those actions of the Conservative Party were very good for Canada .
Mr. Rob Anders :
Mr. Speaker , years after their government fell from 177 seats down to two , lo and behold in 1997 the Tories are still proud of their record of introducing the goods and services tax .
nothing ceases to amaze me .
in terms of regulation , these free marketeers kept the CRTC around through thick and thin during Tory governments , Brian Mulroney governments .
as part of its mandate some time after the turn of the millennium 100 % of all programming in Canada was to be Canadian content .
there would not be anything allowed outside Canadian content .
we may be proud of some of the programs we produce in Canada , but shame on those Tories who supported the idea that people should not be able to watch anything other than Canadian content .
Mr. Charlie Power :
Mr. Speaker , I agree with the member with respect to deregulation .
it is something we all have to do .
today a piece of legislation is being presented that deregulates and opens up a Canadian industry so that more jobs can be created through deregulation .
i cannot understand how the Reformers say in one case it is good and in the next case it is bad .
they have to be consistent .
in our case we are consistent .
we believe in free trade .
it creates jobs in Canada and we are proud of our record on that accomplishment .
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak today on Bill C - 17 , introduced last week by the Minister of Industry .
the Telecommunications Act and Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act follow in the path of removing monopolies and trade barriers in the service sector to allow Canadian firms to capitalize on their strong reputation in the international marketplace .
canada ' s $ 18 billion telecommunications industry provides over a 145,000 direct and indirect jobs to the Canadian economy .
the international telecommunications sector stood at $ 770 billion in value in 1995 and is expected to grow to $ 1.2 trillion in 2002 .
the bill allows our Canadian telecommunications sector to serve the international community and increase its overall value by gaining valuable market access not only to the world ' s largest telecommunications nation , the United States , but also in 65 other markets .
canada held extensive negotiations with the United States at the World Trade Organization last February where 67 countries were involved in trade services agreement negotiations .
canada coupled with the United States are important players in the international telecommunications industry because we have the largest volume of bilateral telephone traffic in the world .
we obviously love to talk .
since the days of Alexander Graham Bell and Marconi Canada , Canada has been a major in telecommunications .
as with any trade objective certain aspects of the bill before us should be given serious consideration .
before I outline these portions of the bill I would like to examine the importance of Canada ' s overall trade competitiveness today .
it is important to note several factors that seem to surround our trade partnerships today .
since the signing of the free trade agreement and the subsequent NAFTA negotiations , Canada has become a prominent player on the international trade scene .
thanks to the foresight of a previous government , Canada has recognized the importance of free trade in today ' s global economy .
without the original free trade agreement Canada ' s ability to secure its place in the vast North American marketplace could have been lost forever .
thankfully the once hotly debated issue of free trade has even been accepted by many groups and individuals adamantly opposed to it in 1998 .
because of a previous government ' s initiative Canada ' s main objective of having secure access to the American market is now a reality and this bill increases that access .
with it comes certain consequences .
since the American economy is considerably larger than our own , we have found ourselves at times willing to trade away reasonable access to the American market in return for little or limited access .
this has caused some to decry that free trade with the U.S. is really only a form of managed trade .
there are examples where the government has failed in this area .
the reason lies in the tentative nature in which Canada approaches invoking trade remedies and the lack of progress in negotiations surrounding this topic .
granted , this can create difficulty for certain industry sectors .
however it is part and parcel of holding such open access to the American market , a position which many other countries would certainly relish .
the facts are undeniable .
canada ' s exports have grown from $ 105 billion before free trade to $ 245 billion last year .
American imports have also grown substantially , from $ 92 billion to $ 210 billion .
overall , Canada ' s trade surplus has grown considerably , reaching the $ 40 billion level last year .
furthermore , free trade has catalysed significant growth in productivity and has promoted economies of scale .
the World Trade Organization agreement saw Europe and the United States allow greater foreign control of telephone service companies thereby catalysing competition and construction of the international networks , thereby following the philosophy of the federal trade agreement and ensuring that Canadian firms have market access to the larger international markets like the United States .
in turn , the government has had to end monopolies held by two Canadian companies in key sectors .
Teleglobe Canada ' s monopoly on overseas telecommunications will end in October 1998 while Telesat Canada , which now controls all domestic long distance satellite phone service , will see its monopoly end in March 2000 .
private sector industry officials state that these types of concessions were necessary , given that the North American market is heading in the direction of open access enabling Canadian firms to partner with others to offer international services .
furthermore the increase in international market access will also benefit telecommunications equipment manufacturers in Canada , some being in my own riding .
i find it interesting that the government is willing to advocate the privatization by the previous Conservative government of Teleglobe and Telesat Canada .
at the time the former opposition party argued that we would lose our identity if the privatization process continued .
this is another example of the Liberal government ' s ability to read public opinion polls and change sides on an issue depending on how it will play with the public .
given the fact that the government is now supporting and furthering the policy of the previous government , our party will support Bill C - 17 .
i look forward to having further discussions on this bill in committee .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , once again I cannot resist commenting .
we have had Tories standing in the House today talking about how they do not like monopolies and how they are encouraged by these liberalizing trade initiatives .
however , they still have people out and about in my province who are in favour of monopolies .
as a matter of fact , Harvey Andre , who used to be the government House whip and was also in charge of Canada Post , still believes in Canada Post and to this day writes letters to Calgary publications .
he said that Canada Post should have an exclusive monopoly and that nobody else should be able to deliver mail in the country , that if there is a courier within a city that can deliver mail overnight for 19 垄 , they should not be allowed to do it .
as a result , Harvey Andre was in support of disallowing the city of Calgary to deliver bills more cheaply than Canada Post could do it .
as well , Harvey Andre supports Canada Post using Purolator Courier to subsidize its competition against United Parcel Service and Federal Express as private couriers .
i wonder whether or not the Tory members in this House today support the monopolies that Canada Post enjoys and uses to subsidize , driving its private competitors out of its industry .
Mr. David Price :
we have come a long way .
the hon. member is sitting in the House here .
luckily he is not the government .
that would really be a scary thought .
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) :
i am pleased to see that at least those PCs who are here in this House are talking more and more about taking away these monopolies .
i mentioned earlier that I was in the telecommunications industry prior to becoming a member of Parliament and was directly involved with the CRTC and Teleglobe .
anyone who was directly involved in that industry can see the tremendous benefits that have occurred from deregulation .
the prices of telephone calls for example .
we see advertisements now on television where calls can be made to anywhere in the country on Sunday for 10 垄 or 5 垄 , or whatever it is .
certainly in the early 1980 s it would be something like $ 1.60 a minute .
when we go back those 15 years or more we can see that it was really a tremendously expensive exercise .
these deregulations benefit ordinary people , the average wage earner tremendously .
i was very pleased to hear from the content of the speech that at least the Tories are starting to see that taking monopolies out of existence is a good idea .
Mr. David Price :
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am going to be splitting my time with the hon. member for London West in the discussion on Bill C - 17 , an act to amend the Telecommunications Act and the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act .
we have heard the legislation before the House is a necessary step toward implementing the GATS agreement on basic telecommunications and liberalizing global telecommunications .
that agreement covers more than 69 countries with more than 90 % of the world ' s $ 880 billion telecommunications market .
it liberalizes basic telecommunications services which includes voice and data but not broadcasting .
it is a good deal for Canada .
it will dramatically expand the $ 880 billion world market in telecommunications services , creating a demand for Canadian products and services .
that will lead to more high quality jobs and economic growth .
telecommunications are vital to Canada and have always been , ever since Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone .
Canadians have gone on to become leaders in the telecommunications industry .
in Canada we already have in place the world ' s first coast to coast commercial microwave network , the world ' s longest fibre optic communications network , the world ' s two longest competitive cellular networks , the world ' s first national digital microwave network , and the world ' s first domestic geostationary satellite telecommunications network .
it is easy to see why the telecommunications industry is an essential component of the Canadian economy .
it employs some 115,000 people and accounts for 3.36 % of our GDP .
these are high wage jobs with average weekly earnings that are 44 % higher than in all industries combined .
telecommunications is also a pivotal enabling technology that is increasingly an integral part of all types of businesses and public sector agencies .
the bill now before the House continues the liberalization of Canada ' s telecommunications market begun more than 10 years ago .
we have already seen the benefits of that domestic liberalization for Canadians and Canadian telecommunications companies .
now we will see them in the international arena .
one of the government ' s key objectives during the GATS negotiations was to gain more access to foreign markets for Canadian telecommunications companies .
that goal was achieved .
these companies will now have more secure access to markets like the United States , the European Union , Japan , and the developing markets of Asia and Latin America .
as part of the deal Canada will make a number of changes to its domestic regime .
we have made the following undertakings .
we will remove all restrictions on the use of foreign controlled global mobile satellites that provide services to Canadians .
we will end the Telesat monopoly on fixed satellite services .
we will maintain our transparent and independent regulatory and competition regimes .
we will end Teleglobe Canada ' s monopoly on overseas traffic and its special ownership restrictions which prohibit investment by foreign telecommunications carriers .
we will allow 100 % foreign ownership and control of international submarine cable landings in Canada .
we will however continue our overall foreign investments rules to ensure that our industry remains Canadian owned and controlled .
the agreement on basic telecommunications is also an international milestone .
GATS which came into effect on January 1 , 1995 is the first ever multilateral set of rules for trade in services .
it covers almost all the service sectors , including with this agreement basic telecommunications services .
the new agreement establishes a clear set of multilateral rules in a sector that previously had no rules .
licensing processes will be governed by clear rules and disputes will be resolved in a timely manner through the WTO dispute settlement process .
the WTO dispute settlement understanding , or DSU , provides a number of mechanisms to resolve disagreements , including consultations , panels and reports .
the objective of this process is to arrange either the withdrawal of the offending measure or if that is impractical , compensation to the injured third party .
this dispute settlement process provides the safeguards needed to ensure that countries respect their commitments .
it is this mechanism that underpins the entire agreement .
without it no participating nation could have confidence that the terms of the agreement would be respected .
and without it no telecommunications company could have the confidence necessary to make investments .
the dispute settlement process also provides Canada with a guarantee that the improved access we have won to the U.S. market is secure .
under the agreement , reciprocity tests in the FCC licensing process will be severely restrained .
it requires a commitment to clear , transparent and consistently applied ground rules that ensure access and fair treatment .
the agreement will create a demand for Canadian products and services as it opens the doors to foreign markets .
this will support a strong domestic communications industry and ensure that Canadians will continue to enjoy excellent communications services at competitive prices .
given our many accomplishments in information and communications technology , there can be no doubt that Canada is poised to take full advantage of the newly expanded global markets in telecommunications services .
technologies that are Canadian specialties are already creating whole new industries .
knowledge based industries are growing faster than any other sector in the Canadian economy .
as one of the most wired countries in the world , Canada has the communications and network infrastructure necessary to take full advantage of the information technologies such as electronic commerce .
the government consulted extensively with the telecommunications industry and with consumer groups before signing the agreement and found strong support for it .
now it will be up to Canadian industry to move forward in the global arena and take full advantage of the opportunities presented by this agreement .
in conclusion I urge the House to act quickly in passing this bill .
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. parliamentary secretary for those comments .
i think it is great that we have a gentleman who was a senior executive with one of the larger automobile manufacturing enterprises here in Canada .
i would like to ask him if he could articulate for us exactly how the new licensing regime will help the establishment , development and growth of small businesses rather than big businesses .
Mr. Walt Lastewka :
Mr. Speaker , the act specifies that the controlling of the licensing is there to have an even playing field .
as we change from a monopoly organization into a freer licensing factor it allows more people to get licences and have the same rules .
this is very important in this agreement .
there are a number of things in this agreement which are trying to put forward an even playing field .
by having an even playing field this allows other entrants into the marketplace .
Mr. Werner Schmidt :
Mr. Speaker , in principle I suppose one would agree but I am asking myself the question that the bill does not in any way suggest how these licences will be granted , what the parameters will be and how the actual way in which these licences will be given .
how could this then create a level playing field when nobody knows exactly what the licences will be or what the guidelines will be as to who gets licences and what the conditions of the licences will be ?
Mr. Walt Lastewka :
Mr. Speaker , one must understand that once the act is passed there will be total consultation on this subject .
licensing is not unique to Canada .
in fact , the U.S. , the UK and the European Union have licensing agreements today and they apply them .
therefore under the CRTC we would be consulting with the stakeholders and coming forth with the most effective licensing arrangement at the lowest costs .
that is always an item which is close to everybody ' s heart , to make sure that fees are very low and only for the implementation of the licensing .
those consultations will follow and the licensing rules will be established .
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , since this is the first occasion in this Parliament that I have had a chance to speak , I wish to congratulate the Speakers and to say that I will co - operate and respect this office and this Parliament .
i also take the opportunity to thank very strongly the voters in my riding of London West .
i appreciate their support and I will continue to work with the dedication and the integrity and I hope the intelligence that they so richly deserve .
i would also like to point out that as we work in this capacity as parliamentarians there is a price in our families .
i want to thank my husband and my children and also say to my colleagues across the floor of the House that I hope that throughout this Parliament I can continue to treat them with the respect and courtesy that any member of Parliament deserves .
i am pleased to speak on behalf of Bill C - 17 which supports the government ' s strategy to make Canada a leader in the knowledge economy of the 21 st century .
our overarching goal is to connect Canadians , to make Canada the most connected country in the world and to ensure that all Canadians have access to the information highway and the new economy which it supports .
the Minister of Industry has correctly identified this as perhaps the single most important action that the government can take to ensure our success in the knowledge based economy and I believe we all know that in our own ridings .
this is a very vital sector to the Canadian economy .
it produces already 115,000 high wage jobs , high intelligence jobs , jobs that are in all our sectors across this country .
it accounts for 3.36 % of our gross domestic product and I see this growing .
if we take these necessary steps to encourage this industry ' s growth , we can take on the world .
i know that is not where Canada wants to be .
we are not sitting back .
as a government we have moved decisively over the last four years to continue the liberalization of Canada ' s telecommunications sector .
i want to review some of the steps we have taken .
the liberalization began in 1984 with the licensing of competitive cellular telephone service .
it moved forward with the privatization of Teleglobe in 1987 and Telesat in 1992 , and still it advanced further with the introduction of long distance competition in 1992 and the passage in 1993 of a new telecommunications act .
the process has continued over the last two years with the licensing of competitive personal communications services in 1995 and local multipoint communications services in 1996 .
further in 1996 the government set out its policy and principles for the convergence of cable and telephone services , creating one of the most competition driven policy regimes in the world .
this legislation marks the latest stage of this liberalization and clears the way for Canada ' s participation in the GATS agreement on basic telecommunications which was concluded last February .
the agreement covers 69 countries with more than 90 % of the world ' s $ 880 billion telecommunications market .
it covers basic telecommunications services , voice and data , but not broadcasting .
the immediate purpose of the legislation is to implement those changes to Canada ' s regulatory regime that are necessary .
the longer term objective is to foster competition , one of the government ' s top priorities in this area .
we are already a world leader in this sector and we will get more of that market share when we widen it up with very visible rules .
competition is not an end in itself .
still a longer term objective of fostering competition is to ensure Canadians have the advanced technologies they need to gain access to the knowledge economy .
over the past four years we have developed and initiated a plan to ensure that Canada does take full advantage of these technologies .
we are building an information highway where all Canadians can connect at a reasonable cost .
we have created those conditions needed to encourage the private sector to build this information highway .
hardware and software developers and suppliers and content developers are now among the fastest growing industries in this nation .
opening competition in telecommunications services is an important part of our strategy as a government .
we know the best and fastest way to build the infrastructure for the knowledge based economy is through open competition .
by developing a national strategy for the development of this infrastructure , the government will enable all Canadians to find new opportunities for business , learning and communicating with one another .
this can only be good .
Canadians want us to move forward quickly to secure for them the benefits of a new economy .
the government is working on a number of fronts to do this .
by creating the best environment for electronic commerce , Canada will become the world leader in this emerging field , generating increased investment in electronic networks and growth in areas such as electronic transactions , multimedia products and online services .
the OECD Canada conference ensures we can support , participate in and influence the creation of an open , transparent multilateral electronic commerce regime .
the government is also working toward using electronic commerce when doing business with its own clients .
by being a model user the federal government can encourage the private sector and other levels of government to adopt the technology .
but it does not stop there .
as part of our national strategy , the government initiated a number of programs to ensure that Canadians acquire the tools and skills from the earliest age that they need to prosper in this new economy .
these include computers for schools programs through which government departments , businesses and institutions donate surplus computer equipment and software to schools .
it includes the student connection program which enables university and college students to help small businesses learn to use the Internet , as my colleague suggested .
the community access program connects and will connect every rural Canadian community with more than 400 people to the Internet by the year 2000 .
and how could we forget the SchoolNet program which connects all our 16,500 schools and 3,400 public libraries in Canada to the Internet .
across this country students , teachers , professionals , business people and just Canadians are using these facilities because we have to ensure Internet literacy and move forward into the next century which will be different than the last century .
the government is going online itself making government services accessible to people wherever they are , 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
this is being done in every department and agency in this country .
none of this would be possible without telecommunications infrastructure and those supports for it .
we cannot have that infrastructure without a strong , dynamic telecommunications industry .
this bill before us today is a necessary step toward giving our telecommunications sector service companies the keys they need to open the doors to the new world , the world market of vast proportions .
once that door is open we can rely on Canadian expertise , Canadian entrepreneurship in all our ridings to do the rest .
the result will be better telecommunications services .
an infrastructure will support us in the next century .
i suggest we are on the information highway and we will move forward on that highway together .
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have been both exhilarated and disappointed today .
we have before us a bill that on the one hand is being exalted as the greatest development that will advance the causes of technology and communication that has ever hit the floor of this House .
it has given members of the government the opportunity to brag , to extol the virtues of how much they are doing to get Canadians on to the information highway and to make sure that all communities and all Canadians everywhere will be connected to this information highway .
at the same time these very same people recognize that there is not the capacity in Canada to do that right now .
whatever connection there is is tenuous at best .
those two things are completely separate .
i submit that it would have been very much better if the government had submitted two bills , one which dealt with amendments to the Telecommunications Act , the other which dealt with amendments to the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act .
it would have been far more successful and far more logical .
the issue behind this bill is to recognize the principle involved .
there is not much doubt or argument about the basic principles of increasing competition , expanding the ownership possibilities of telecommunications vehicles and ending monopolies .
it is rather encouraging that the Liberals , who tend to govern from the top down and intrude into business , have seen this as a major principle .
it is about time that Canadians recognized that government does not have all the answers .
yet within this very bill , we are reverting to government regulation and control of business .
i want to hearken back to the Information Highway Advisory Committee .
this committee started with one set of recommendations in its first volume and then it came up with a second volume in which it began to implement things .
one of the principles which the committee stated very unequivocally in the first report which it presented to the Minister of Industry was that the origin of the capital of a particular business , particularly a business in telecommunications , ought not to be so much the concern of the government , but rather the concern should be how that capital is applied .
is the capital applied in such a way that meets the economic and social goals of Canada ?
if the capital does those things it does not matter where it originated .
we need to focus very carefully and clearly on what it is we want to achieve in any legislation , particularly in legislation that deals with such a pervasive issue as telecommunications , the linking of people talking with one another through electronic means .
two parliamentary secretaries expressed great pride in how broad the consultation had been on this bill .
i do not know with whom they spoke .
i have a report from an Internet service provider which arrived about five minutes ago .
in fact , the report is from the legal counsel to the Internet service provider .
he makes this observation :
i am concerned that this bill empowers the CRTC to declare that something is a basic telecommunications service , without any criteria to define " basic '' , and then subject the service provider to a licensing regime .
this licensing regime overturns the previous scheme of the Telecommunications Act in a fundamental way .
the previous act - the one now in force - says that anyone may operate as a Canadian carrier who satisfies ownership criteria .
the new one subjects every service that the CRTC wishes to regulate to a comprehensive scheme of licensing .
the key phrase is whatever service the CRTC wishes to regulate .
this is a major departure .
it is an intrusion into the operation of telecommunications such as we have never seen before .
it was never a part of the Telecommunications Act .
when the Minister of Industry gave his speech in defence of Bill C - 17 we were all enamoured by his commitment , by his seriousness and by his total support for the development of telecommunications and the whole business of innovation , science and technology developments and the application and commercialization of new ideas .
he used the telecommunications business as an example of how this could be done .
i congratulate the minister for doing that .
however , the minister failed to comment on one aspect of the bill which is an intrusion into the affairs of business .
we have to get serious about that .
this is no itsy - bitsy committee whose members get together every once in a while to talk to one another and have a good time , go out for a beer or a coffee or whatever .
this is a quasi - judicial body that can bind businesses or individuals and can determine how much you and I pay for our telephone rates .
it can determine who will be the supplier of the pipe or the line or the fibre optic or satellite communication or wireless .
it has the right to determine these kinds of things .
the CRTC has been given a brand new mandate and authority it did not have before .
it has been given the authority , in clause 3 , the new section 16 , for new powers of licensing .
it is very interesting what these powers actually are .
these powers establish classes of licences .
that is one thing it does .
it establishes the classes of services that would require a licence .
now we are hitting on two sides .
first , it tells us the kinds of licences we will have .
second , it tell us these are the service providers who will be required to have a licence .
they may be the same but they may also be different .
the act is completely ambiguous in declaring exactly what is going to happen in this area .
i would like to make several observations with regard to this ambiguity .
what does this ambiguity permit ?
first , it allows the establishment of many or few classes .
the more classes there are the more administration , the more distributors , the more ways in which you find the CRTC getting into various areas .
it decides how many of these classes there will be .
second , it allows the CRTC to establish classes on an arbitrary basis .
it does not provide any indication of the conditions and guidelines to be used before a particular class of licence is established .
this is a figment of somebody ' s imagination first and then it is how much can fit here .
it sounds like someone who is getting ready for a Ph . D . dissertation .
he takes a particular position and says this is my hypothesis .
then he draws a conclusion and says that this is my conclusion .
he wonders around until he finds enough evidence to prove his conclusion given the hypothesis , rather than deciding on the hypothesis and looking for the evidence .
this is very serious .
that is the kind of thing that could happen here .
far worse than that , the classes of licences could perpetuate obsolescence .
it puts into a straitjacket the conditions that qualify a business or service provider getting a licence in the first place .
that is terrible .
we would not have the advancement in telecommunications if we had had these kinds of constraints placed on new service providers , with new ideas and new ways of applying the technology .
we should look at this very carefully .
the CRTC may now establish the conditions for the licences .
not only can it establish the classes of licences , the kinds of businesses that would be required to have a licence , but now the conditions .
these too have no guidelines .
what will the conditions be ?
will a service provider need a particular financial capability ?
does it mean there has to have a particular concentration of ownership or if the ownership is too concentrated it will not get a licence ?
will it be a coverage area that is involved or the range of services that will be provided ?
then the question becomes is this a range of services that relates to the Internet ?
will this be a service that will be on the information highway or could it be something that is independent of that ?
we do not know .
however , we do know that the government is already on record insisting that in order for a certain kind of business to operate it must commit a certain proportion of its earnings and revenues toward research and development .
i do not think that is necessarily a bad requirement .
in fact , we need far more research and development in this country .
neither does private enterprise commit to research and development in the proportion that it should .
we need that kind of commitment .
for that to be a possible condition for a licence is rather difficult .
these are some of the questions on the business of licensing .
however , there is an even more significant part to licensing .
it is not only the people who will get the licences and the conditions of licences , the bill goes even further and states that the CRTC may establish conditions relative to circumstances of the licensee .
this raises all kinds of questions .
does this now escalate the problem above and beyond direct political and / or commission arbitrariness .
now we are not only determining the conditions but the circumstances that would be involved .
it could prevent certain people from entering the market by making regulations that are so demanding it would be impossible for them to ever get into the business .
it is sort of like issuing a tender for a motorcycle and setting the specifications for that motorcycle in such a way that there would only be one possible manufacturer that could meet those specifications .
these are very serious possibilities .
it could also bring about that those who would get a licence would be friends of the government , those who are friends of management or directors of the CRTC , perhaps people in a particular management structure .
who knows ?
this could possibly create different cost structures for different classes of licences .
we do not know what the circumstances would be .
if we put those four things in the legislative provision of licences , we would begin to ask ourselves how could anyone truly and honestly and fairly administer such a system ?
if I was a bureaucrat and I wanted to establish myself as a bureaucratic entrepreneur , that is getting more and more people to come under my supervision , I would use this kind of a system .
it would mean that I could have the whole world before me .
i could create the types of licences I wanted , the kinds of services that would get the licences and then I could determine the conditions and the circumstances .
it would be possible to build an empire that would be so great that it would be absolutely impossible for anybody to do anything without first of all coming to me to ask " How will we do this ? "
it has tremendous and horrendous implications .
the bottom line question in all of this is that it does not increase flexibility .
it is the very opposite .
not long ago the CRTC stated in one of its publications that it wanted local competition , a development I heralded with great support at the time and still do .
i think it is wonderful .
in 1995 - 96 the commission initiated four different public proceedings to put into place conditions for effective competition in the local telephone market .
these proceedings deal with co - location , local interconnection , network component unbundling , local number portability and price cap regulation .
co - location is intended to facilitate competition by providing competitors with the option of delivering their traffic to local switches over either leased or owned facilities .
Unbundling refers to the requirement that incumbent local telephone companies make available at tariffied rates elements of their facilities to which competitors would require access to effectively enter the local telephone market .
this is a tremendous policy for the CRTC to develop .
it is exactly what should happen .
last night I had the opportunity to meet with a couple of entrepreneurs who were doing exactly that .
they have put in the ground loops of fibre optic cable which now allows them to get into local telephone market .
this will put them in direct competition with the B.C. Tels and the Bells that have monopolies in these areas .
finally we have competition .
that is absolutely tremendous and the CRTC ought to be commended for it .
the legislation indicates what the CRTC did over here but gives it the power to frustrate what it had over there .
this adjustment will produce artificial subsidies to residential local service that complicate the introduction of competition .
implementation of a price cap regime will also give service providers more freedom to price individual services and to reap the benefits of productivity improvements .
this is tremendous stuff .
in spite of that concern I have complete support for the other part of the bill which would change or amend the reorganization of Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act .
that should be moved forward expeditiously .
tomorrow we should do that if we possibly could .
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( St. Catharines , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I thank the member for Kelowna for his remarks .
i know his preparedness as industry critic is always fine tuned .
he appreciates the importance of telecommunications .
i want to ask a number of questions .
if we are to deregulate and have more people in the telecommunications business , does he believe there should be a level playing field among the participants and that new participants should be allowed to come in with a certain approval requirement , or does he believe that it should be wide open ?
Mr. Werner Schmidt :
let those who are particularly successful and good win the day .
i do not think governments should decide ahead of time who should be the winner or who should be the loser .
that is the difficulty with the bill .
we would not have them today if we had regulations that said they could not come in unless they met some conditions .
the time has come for government to create the overall broad framework so that we can succeed in that environment and let the market decide who will provide the best service for the least cost .
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I appreciate the time to debate this issue with the hon. member for Kelowna .
i want to make sure people understand that the proposed approach is not intended to restrict the entry of new players into the market or to exclude players .
i understand the CRTC is doing some advance consultation now with the industry .
its objective will be to consult with the industry on what is required to have the rules participants will operate under .
this lesson has been learned in the U.S. , in the U . K . and in the European Union .
it is not any different from what we want to propose in Canada .
if we are to have a level playing field we need the rules of the playing field and to let the industry decide what the conditions should be .
the government wants to do exactly that .
it wants to make sure the rules are understood and the players can compete .
would the member for Kelowna disagree with that ?
Mr. Werner Schmidt :
that is exactly right .
let the industry come into it rather than the government .
i think he really believes that and that is why he said it .
that is not what the bill says .
i wish the bill would say that .
if he could prove to me that the bill says that I would wholeheartedly agree with him .
the issue he has raised is the right one .
i would like to mention , because it is brand new , that he said the lesson has been learned and the CRTC knows it .
the mission statement reads :
we do so by regulating our broadcasting and telecommunications industries in open , flexible ways to foster creative freedom and strengthen the prosperity of all our citizens .
let us now read the mandate of the CRTC and compare the two statements .
the mandate reads :
the CRTC is vested with the authority to license , regulate and supervise all broadcasting undertakings within Canada and to regulate telecommunications commentaries that fall under federal jurisdiction .
it goes on .
is this not interesting ?
it has made a regulatory body its mandate but its mission is to help Canadians better understand their values and diversity and to have open , flexible ways to foster creative freedom and strengthen the prosperity of all our citizens .
it looks to me as if the regulation on the one hand and the mission on the other , if not in contradiction are certainly running in different directions .
if the lesson has been learned the CRTC should demonstrate it .
it has been known for years that the CRTC has not been the facilitator of private enterprise and competition but rather the protector of monopolistic interests .
i have talked about convergence before .
that is a good idea .
there are vestiges in the new provision for licensing ability that move the CRTC back further into the regulation .
i think it is a backward move into the future .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have a question for our colleague , the Reform Party telecommunications critic .
there is much talk in this bill about corporations .
we have mentioned equipment manufacturers , providers of telephone services , cable distributors .
we have also mentioned the consumer , who sees his bill regularly hiked up , but there is no mention of the person who is entitled to privacy .
we do not mention the protection of personal information .
yet that is the flip side of the coin .
only one side of the coin is being talked about now , allowing the industry to expand worldwide through deregulation .
the flip side of the coin : what are the consequences or the potential ill effects for citizens whose personal information can be released all over the planet ?
we know that the federal government has no legislation that really protects personal information once it is in the hands of private business .
i am therefore asking the Reform Party critic this question .
what does the Reform Party recommend for protecting private information , identifying information , what does it have in mind for protecting the public from the misuse by businesses of information on each and every one of us ?
Mr. Werner Schmidt :
Mr. Speaker , it is a superb question , one that is not addressed in this bill or in any other bill .
if he is asking for my personal opinion , I think that is one of the crying needs that must be addressed in the House as the electronics and telecommunications industry develops .
we must guarantee the integrity , the privacy , the security of personal information and confidential information of a business nature .
as we go to electronic banking , transferring funds from one organization to another via electronic means , the security of that information is paramount .
i thank the hon. member for the question .
i certainly support the idea .
Mr. Walt Lastewka :
Mr. Speaker , I meant to address the privacy section in an earlier question but unfortunately the member walked out and I was unable to ask it .
it has been said in the House before that privacy legislation is something the government is concerned with .
we are now studying it , trying to get a simple , flexible privacy of information legislation .
work is being done not only with the government but with the provinces to get as many provinces onside to come up with simple legislation to recommend to the House .
when the public consultations are completed I hope hon. members will be able to add to the government ' s consultations on the privacy section of the legislation that will be introduced in the House in due time .
i thank the hon. member for raising it .
i am sure we will be debating it in committee .
Mr. Werner Schmidt :
Mr. Speaker , when the government brings that legislation forward I hope it will have consulted widely , honestly and with integrity , and listened very much to the experience of the privacy commissioner over the last number of years .
he has a lot of good advice to give us all .

Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) moved :
as many members of this House will know , Sue Rodriguez had fought with incredible dignity , strength and courage , to the Supreme Court of Canada ultimately , to change this law .
she appeared before the House of Commons justice committee .
she made a whole nation aware of this profoundly important issue .
the life of an individual must include dying .
dying is the final act in the drama of life .
the right to die with dignity should be as well protected as is any other aspect of the right to life .
state prohibitions that would force a dreadful , painful death on a rational but incapacitated terminally ill patient are an affront to human dignity .
while there may have been division in the Supreme Court of Canada , there was unanimity on one issue , that it was ultimately up to the House of Commons , the elected House of the people of Canada , to make a decision as to what the law should or should not state on this profoundly important issue .
all the judges who considered this issue were unanimous on that point , the Supreme Court of British Columbia , the B.C. Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada .
i note that prior to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada , starting in 1991 a number of other members of Parliament had raised this issue in the House :
Bob Wenman , late Conservative member of Parliament from British Columbia , my former colleague Ian Waddell and my current colleague from Saskatoon - Rosetown - Biggar .
following the death of Sue Rodriguez in February 1994 , within days of her death , both the prime minister and the then justice minister , currently the Minister of Health , promised that there would be a free vote in this House on this important issue .
four days later the justice minister said : " I am sure that doctors could tell us that a number of people right now are facing terminal illness who would want to have a clarification '' .
he went on to say : " We will have a free vote as soon as we possibly can '' .
the Minister of Justice said , and I quote :
i can assure you that we will find a way to introduce something in the House that will not be theoretical and that will be significant .
if that means proposing legislative changes , so be it .
he added :
we will not sit on this .
we will do it as quickly as we can .
almost four years later we have finally achieved that objective of ultimately this House ' s being able to have a free vote on the issue .
in May 1994 it was the national convention of the federal Liberal Party that passed almost unanimously a resolution urging the government to allow a free vote on this important issue .
as well in the spring of 1994 , again shortly after the death of Sue Rodriguez , the Senate established a special committee chaired by a very distinguished former senator , Joan Neiman .
the committee reported in June 1995 , after having held extensive right across the country .
i want to pay tribute to all members of that committee for their work .
it was a very important committee and an excellent report called " Of Life and Death '' .
i want to explain very carefully and very precisely what this motion seeks to achieve .
the motion does not set out the terms for new legislation .
it calls for the establishment of a special committee of this House .
obviously it could be decided that the standing committee on justice may be a more appropriate forum , but in any event it calls for a committee of this House to review evidence , certainly not to redo all the work of the Senate committee , to review the findings , the evidence and the recommendations of that committee and then to make recommendations back to this House .
the Senate committee was unanimous on a number of recommendations , including the importance of support for palliative care , pain control , and looked at the issue of sedation practices , the so - called double effect , withholding and withdrawal of life sustaining treatment and advance directives .
it was able to arrive at unanimous recommendations for changes in those areas of the law .
that bill would have clarified the Criminal Code with respect to a couple of key elements .
what it would have done was clarify the practice of providing treatment for the purpose of alleviating suffering that may shorten life .
it would also recognize explicitly and clarify the circumstances in which withholding and withdrawal of treatment is legally acceptable .
it may be that is as far as this special committee of the House is prepared to go .
the Leader of the Opposition has stated that if a government bill were to be presented to Parliament , and presumably that would apply to a private member ' s motion as well , permitting physician assisted suicide under the conditions which he had set out in his consultation with his constituents , he would vote for that bill .
that was because when he surveyed his own constituents he found that something like 82 % of those constituents supported this change .
i want in urging the House to change the law to pay tribute to the many dedicated groups and individuals working for this change in the law , including the Right to Die Society and John Hofsess , Dying with Dignity and Marilyn Seguin , groups like Goodbye , the Unitarian Church and many others .
i note as well the issue is being debated in other parts of the world .
in fact today we will learn the results of a referendum in Oregon .
earlier in the Australia Northern Territory Premier Marshall Perron courageously fought to bring forward a bill , only to see it ultimately overturned by the national parliament .
why is it that I believe that the current law is profoundly cruel and unjust and must be changed ?
all of those are fundamentally important .
the best palliative care in the world cannot respond in all circumstances to all suffering , indignity and anguish .
i note the Canadian Palliative Care Association has acknowledged that .
it pointed out that in something like 16 % of cases of terminal illness , the patients must be so sedated that they are " incapable of meaningful interaction with their families '' .
there were some patients , some terminally ill people , Sue Rodriguez among them , who did not want to live or to die that way .
i argue that in those narrow circumstances in which palliative care cannot respond to the suffering , the pain and the anguish the issue is one of choice , fundamentally of personal autonomy , whether we accept the right of competent adults to decide for themselves how their lives will end .
as it now stands under the current law , the choice is either to continue that suffering and anguish or to be sedated into a state of pharmaceutical oblivion , or to find a doctor who is prepared to break the law and risk life imprisonment , as in the case of Sue Rodriguez , or if you cannot find a doctor , as we have seen tragically in some circumstances , to leave your own country .
we saw that with Austin Bastable in 1996 .
we saw that just recently with my constituent , Mr. Natverlal Thakore , this year .
you should not have to leave your country and your family to die in peace .
i find it particularly cruel and barbarous that Mr. Tahkore had to leave his own country and his family to go to die in a motel room in Michigan with the help of a doctor he had probably never met .
this is not acceptable .
it is time that we ended the hypocrisy in this area and admitted that assisted suicides are happening now .
they are happening with no guidelines , with no review , with no safeguards whatsoever .
the B.C. Persons with AIDS Society pointed out that this is a very serious concern within that community as well .
its spokesman said in his evidence before the Senate committee that people with HIV disease choosing assisted death as a medical option are being forced as a result of current legislation to seek backstreet euthanasia .
he talked about violent methods of euthanasia such as heroin overdoses , razor blades , guns and suffocation using plastic bags .
Dr. Ted Boadway of the Ontario Medical Association stated at a Canadian Medical Association convention " Doctors are doing it entirely underground and entirely unrecognized , in great fear and anxiety '' .
one doctor talked about how in his words " you can make a person comfortable with 50 milligrams of Demerol and you can make a person very , very dead with 500 milligrams of Demerol '' , and about giving a suffering , terminally ill patient a prescription for sleeping pills but instead of giving her the normal 12 , he gave her 40 as she requested .
it is happening now but in the shadows , behind closed doors with no safeguards .
when people ask what about the slippery slope , those dangers are clearly already there .
of course there must be strict safeguards in place .
the Canadian Medical Association ' s committee on ethics made a number of recommendations , as did the Senate committee that studied this issue .
these are some of the safeguards that have been recommended which I strongly support : the importance of a person ' s request ; being informed , voluntary , enduring and free of any coercion ; the importance of the physician ensuring the person is competent and not suffering from any disorder that impairs his or her ability to make the decision ; exploring the reasons in detail in incurable illness and severe suffering ; the physician not being compelled in any way to participate in euthanasia or assisted suicide and not in a position to gain in any way .
i will also respond briefly to some of the serious concerns that have been raised by people with disabilities and organizations representing people with disabilities , such as the Council of Canadians with Disabilities .
they voiced very eloquently their fear that if legislation were brought in that in any way diminished the importance of their lives or devalued their lives , they would strongly oppose it .
they are deeply concerned about some of the arguments they have heard around the Tracy Latimer decision .
i emphasize that what is being debated here is fundamentally different .
what is being debated here is the right of a competent adult who is terminally or incurably ill to make that decision for himself or herself , not by another person , not by a doctor , not by relative , not by a parent but for himself or herself .
i quote from the B.C. Coalition of People with Disabilities that supports changes to this section of the Criminal Code .
it states in its recommendation to the Senate " we support changes that would make it legal to assist in the suicide of adults who know and understand all of the support options available to them and who are physically unable to take their life without assistance '' .
i was pleased that the coalition intervened in support of Sue Rodriguez in her struggle before the courts .
some of the most powerful arguments for change in the law come from the families and friends of those who have lost a loved one in terribly agonizing circumstances .
following the death of Sue Rodriguez , I received literally hundreds of incredibly moving letters .
i will share a couple of examples .
i got a letter from the son of Quebec author and actor Doris Lussier .
his son is Pierre Lussier .
he said :
Papa , do not let the politicians , barbarians by any other name , tell me that your horrible cry of mortal pain on the eve of your death , even unconscious , when we were far from your room at the other end of the corridor , was a sign of comfort .
i shared in the agony of a charming , joyful , cultivated , reasonable human being , whom I loved more than anyone in the world , with no possibility of releasing him from his suffering as he so often asked of me .
he was a total advocate of civilized death .
i could read from many other letters .
i could read the letter of a man who wrote to me about his daughter who was in agony most of the time .
he said that her jaw would sometimes dislocate when she yawned .
she could not move her bowels so her sister had to evacuate her manually every second day .
several huge bed sores developed which never healed .
she tried to kill herself by refusing to eat .
finally she had a stroke which prevented her from using her communicator and she spent the last few years of her life in total isolation wailing dreadfully , pleading for an end to her suffering .
that is no way to die .
one of the most difficult experiences I have had to live with has been the calls and letters I have received from people who plead with me to find a doctor to help them .
i cannot respond to that , but what I can do is to plead with this House to ensure that the law is changed so that we have humanity and justice .
in closing , I want to appeal to all members of the House .
palliative care in and of itself is not enough .
sue Rodriguez had superb palliative care .
let an all - party committee hear from Canadians on all sides of this issue , review the evidence and recommendations of the Senate committee and then report back to the House with legislation to be voted on in a free vote .
it would be a tragic mistake to close the door at this stage to any further debate .
respected doctors like Dr. Keon , nurses and other health care workers , and most of all our own constituents , are asking that the law be , at the very least , clarified and hopefully changed to reflect humanity and justice .
i hope that my efforts will not have been in vain and that the Minister of Justice will introduce legislation into Parliament soon so that terminally ill people will have another option available , thereby permitting physician assisted suicide for the terminally ill .
may her courageous struggle and that of others who have made the same eloquent plea not be in vain .
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise before the House today in response to the proposal moved by the hon. member for Burnaby - Douglas that a special committee be appointed to review the provisions of the Criminal Code dealing with euthanasia and physician assisted suicide , and that the committee be instructed to prepare and bring in a bill .
as my colleagues in the House would no doubt agree , the subjects referred to in this motion raise very complex legal , moral and social issues that Canadians are increasingly concerned about , but remain clearly divided on .
a Montreal woman in a depressed state drowns her six - year - old son before attempting suicide .
a Halifax doctor is charged with the death of a terminally ill cancer patient under her care .
these are just two examples to illustrate the complexity of this issue .
the hon. member who moved the motion illustrated the human toll which this issue has taken on Canadian families .
no one in this House would not be moved by these tragedies .
when we debate this subject we must examine questions ranging from the quality of medical care available to seriously ill and dying people to the moral questions involving a person ' s power to control his or her own life , and even the value of life itself .
technological progress in recent decades has considerably improved our capacity to extend life and , in an aging society , the issues of care and treatment at the end of life take on ever greater importance .
many individuals , professionals , organizations and associations have clearly expressed their concerns on this over the 16 months of hearings held by the Senate Special Committee on Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide .
in June 1995 , the committee tabled its report entitled " On Life and Death '' .
the stated goals of the committee were to help the public to develop a better understanding of this very complex subject and to set the stage for a full and open national debate .
the committee referred to its report as an initial step in the long process ahead for Canadians attempting to find solutions to the problems that it raises .
the issues raised by this motion , that is , euthanasia and assisted suicide , are profoundly controversial .
it is clear that the special Senate committee was aware of this .
i am sure we would all concur .
the Senate report raised a number of problems which must be carefully addressed .
the committee had little difficulty reaching consensus on issues regarding medical and health care practices , such as developing national guidelines to address pain control and sedation , and the withholding or withdrawal of treatment .
however , there were no such agreements among committee members when it came to dealing with the more difficult questions of euthanasia and physician assisted suicide .
even in the case of the less controversial recommendations , I would suggest a great deal has yet to be done before we take any steps to consider amendments to the Criminal Code .
let me illustrate by way of example areas where further work is required .
having heard and considered testimony from numerous health care professionals appearing individually or on behalf of numerous associations representing doctors , nurses and other professionals , the Senate committee report was unequivocal in its recommendations in chapters 3 , 4 and 5 that urged the development and implementation of national guidelines and standards in a number of areas such as palliative care , pain control , sedation practices and the withholding and withdrawal of life - sustaining treatment .
these guidelines which seemingly have not yet been drafted , should help those who , every day , must make decisions or help others make decisions concerning palliative care and treatment .
Moveover , few Canadian provinces and territories have passed legislation on advance directives , generally known as living wills .
such legislation is important in order to recognize and support the participation of patients and their family in the decisions relating to medical care and treatment when they reach the end of their lives .
at such times , when critical decisions must be made , it is useful and less stressful for those involved to make these decisions if they know the patient ' s wishes .
until this work is completed , I think it would be premature to look at how the Criminal Code should deal with these issues .
referring to the motion before us , while it is clear that I am of the opinion we should not be considering any amendments to the Criminal Code at this time , and I stress at this time , I would also suggest that attempts to do so are fraught with difficulties even when one purports to deal with subject matter upon which there is apparent agreement .
a year ago Bill S - 13 , an act to amend the Criminal Code , protection of health care providers , was introduced in the Senate and was later the subject of second reading debate in that house .
the purpose of that bill as stated by the hon. Senator Sharon Carstairs who introduced it was to implement the unanimous recommendations in chapters 4 and 5 of the Senate report dealing with pain control and the withholding and withdrawal of life - sustaining treatment .
senator Carstairs took great care to point out that her bill did not touch the more controversial aspects of the Senate report , that is , euthanasia or assisted suicide .
yet that bill itself was the subject of controversy and was not fully supported by the senator ' s fellow members of the special committee who had initially supported the recommendations in the first report .
in conclusion I would argue that it is premature , as moved by the hon. member for Burnaby - Douglas , to appoint a special committee when there has been in fact one that has studied the issue to review the provisions of the Criminal Code dealing with euthanasia and physician assisted suicide or to consider the possibility of bringing in a bill when , as the Senate report demonstrated , Canadians are much too divided on these issues .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , may I have the consent of the House to split my time with the member for Macleod .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is it agreed ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz :
Mr. Speaker , a special Senate committee on euthanasia and assisted suicide spent over a year , from February 1994 to June 1995 , studying this issue .
it published a 250 page report in June 1995 .
the Senate committee held 86 meetings and heard from 242 witnesses representing 92 organizations .
it received 24 written submissions , listened to 12 witnesses by teleconference from Holland and received literally thousands of letters from concerned Canadians .
the special Senate committee cost taxpayers more than $ 250,000 not including the salaries of the senators and the staff assigned to the project .
the Senate committee recommended no changes to the Criminal Code offences for voluntary euthanasia , non - voluntary euthanasia and counselling suicide .
the Senate committee only made two recommendations regarding the Criminal Code : that consideration be given for creation of a new murder offence called compassionate homicide ; and that the Criminal Code be amended to explicitly recognize and to clarify the circumstances in which the withholding and withdrawal of life - sustaining treatment is legally acceptable .
a special Senate committee has already spent hundreds of hours , spent more than $ 250,000 and heard hundreds of witnesses , received thousands of letters and issued a 250 page report to the Senate in 1995 .
this motion presupposes that the special committee will agree that amendments to the Criminal Code are needed because the motion directs the committee to prepare and bring in a bill .
if this motion is passed , it will require the special committee to introduce legislation even if the special committee ' s deliberations and debate and public opinion conclude otherwise .
the Criminal Code as it is currently worded provides crown prosecutors with a sufficient number of options when laying charges with respect to homicides .
the changes recommended by the Senate committee are not the highest legislative priority for the general public .
if a special committee is to be struck to draft any bill , Reformers say it should be a victims bill of rights .
for these reasons , I cannot support this motion .
the motion proposed by the hon. member for Burnaby - Douglas proposes to introduce a bill dealing with a very complex and emotional issue .
some Reformers feel this is a moral issue and should be handled using a process employed on issues such as abortion and capital punishment and on issues of personal conscience .
we as Reform MPs follow a four step process to clearly state our views publicly and to ask our constituents to develop , to express and to debate their own views on the matter .
following that process , we seek the consensus of the constituency and support that constituency in Parliament .
for the record , here is my personal view on this issue .
i believe in the inherent value of life and the need to protect the most vulnerable individuals in our society .
while I respect every person ' s right to refuse medical treatment , I do not believe that any changes should be made to the Criminal Code offences of euthanasia , assisted suicide or counselling suicide .
however , I do support designating palliative care as a core service in the Canada Health Act and developing in co - operation with the provinces national guidelines to govern the provision of palliative care services , including research , counselling and education programs .
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to participate in this debate as a clinician , as a GP , as a guy who dealt with people at the end of their lives , and as someone who did surgery .
this has had a very significant impact on my life .
i do this with humility , recognizing that the ending of a life is a significant and important issue .
i would like to make sure that those watching understand what euthanasia is not .
euthanasia is not withholding unwanted heroics .
euthanasia is active help to aid a person commit suicide , or active aid to end a person ' s life .
asking a physician to participate in that goes against everything I was taught in medical school .
proponents say , and in fairness I listen to their arguments very well , that if we had strict guidelines , the process of doctor assisted suicide would be rare .
i do not believe that it is adequate to just listen to those arguments .
a good debater can make those positions well .
i believe it is much more instructive to look at jurisdictions where this has been tried .
Holland of course is probably the best jurisdiction .
Holland has a total population of 15 million , just about half of Canada ' s total population .
the data that I am discussing today is from general practitioners just like me , doctors who see a broad part of family existence .
the Dutch experience is as follows .
i spoke of criteria that would be used by the proponents .
in Holland the criteria are as follows .
a request for euthanasia must be voluntary .
it cannot just be casual .
there must be intolerable or hopeless suffering .
there must be consultation with a second doctor so that one doctor would not make the decision in isolation .
finally , there must be a report to the authorities , a report to the coroner .
how rare is euthanasia in Holland ?
this is not palliative care or surgeons that I am talking about .
GPs permit about 2,000 cases of euthanasia per year .
the most interesting thing about this scientific data is how often were the criteria followed .
it is quite remarkable to find that about 180 patients per year were euthanized without their personal permission .
these were individuals who could have given their permission .
it is quite surprising .
if we look at all doctors in Holland , substantially more than just the GPs , the numbers are even worse .
this is from 1990 .
for those who would like to research this data themselves , it comes from the Remelink study done in 1991 by a justice in Holland .
for all doctors in Holland in 1990 , 2,700 people were euthanized according to the coroners ' records .
even worse , 8,100 were killed by deliberately using pain medication .
here we have in a country half as populated as Canada , over 10,000 people euthanized in one year when only 2,700 were reported .
in Holland doctors have taken over end of life decisions .
this has not become an empowering thing for the patient .
i would conclude by saying giving the power of life to physicians is bad public policy .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are dealing here with an extremely serious matter that must be analyzed in the greatest possible detail .
this is an issue that has been discussed for a long time .
i recall very clearly that during the 35 th Parliament , this issue was raised several times by the member who tabled this motion and also by Michel Daviault , the Bloc Quebecois member for Ahuntsic .
that member went over the issue in great detail , made observations and addressed questions to the government on several occasions on this matter .
just to remind you once again that it is not the first time that we are dealing with this issue in this House , on June 8 , 1995 , in a press release , he stated : " It is important that members examine these issues that concern all Quebeckers and Canadians and make recommendations before the House of Commons is called upon to vote on such sensitive matters '' .
at one time or another , the government will have to examine carefully this whole matter .
with medical advances and given what is acceptable today , which may not have been acceptable yesterday and evolves over time , a responsible government , a government that wants to reflect the evolution of society , will have to get its act together and deal with this area of responsibility , this admittedly difficult issue .
i wish to take the opportunity to congratulate the member who tabled this motion .
i know that it is an issue that he has been closely involved with .
if there is a member in this House that can speak from experience , it is the member from Burnaby - Douglas .
i believe also , however , that this issue must be considered as objectively as possible .
what I find interesting in his motion is the fact that it gives parliamentarians an opportunity to study this matter in a non - partisan manner , with the help of scientists , doctors and families who have lived through such situations , and also in the light of our respective convictions .
this is an issue that has social , economic , religious and moral implications .
all sorts of factors come into play , but this motion gives the government an opportunity to examine the issue and to take a real look at what could be done to arrive at a situation acceptable to the majority of Canadians and Quebeckers .
the present context is not an easy one .
some will say that respect for life is being used as an excuse to outlaw killing .
i think they are right ; that the dignity of human beings is not diminished by suffering .
others , however , will say that the respect for life and the right to die with dignity are personal values and that only the individual who is ill may decide .
legislating euthanasia and assisted suicide therefore poses many ethical problems .
i think a committee could give very serious consideration to these ethical and medical factors .
some news stories have advanced our understanding of this new problem .
there was the case of Nancy B . , Sue Rodriguez , and the most recent , which is still in the headlines , the case of Robert Latimer , a father accused of ending his daughter ' s life for reasons everyone has heard about .
as we heard on the news , the decision is now under appeal .
there have been different interpretations in the media .
however , some extremely important issues have been raised .
yes , the subject must be looked at , but I think it is so important that a very exhaustive study will be required before a bill can be introduced .
the issue must be submitted to the House , studied and reported on even before those who will sit on the committee can draft a bill .
it is a complex task for a committee to study a bill .
i participated in the review of the Young Offenders Act ; the issue was not a heart - wrenching one but I can tell you that after six months , we had not completed the study and we were still pondering many questions .
euthanasia and assisted suicide are related issues .
we can easily predict that studying these matters will take a long time .
i would not want the committee to be burdened with the task of drafting a bill .
that is why , with your permission , Mr. Speaker , I will table an amendment to motion M - 123 .
i would like to see a committee struck , a committee to examine the matter , to report to the House , and subsequently , after the public pressure and the societal debate that it will have triggered in a still more structured way - because this will be referred to the justice committee of the House of Commons , with the assistance of the hon. member who will be able to attend - there will be a report that the House will examine and study .
i believe that the government across the way , giving it the benefit of the doubt as far as its responsibility is concerned , will be able to respond favourably to the report which would be tabled by the House committee .
for this reason , Mr. Speaker , I move :
that the motion be amended by deleting the word " 64 ( 4 ) ( b ) " and by substituting the word " 105 '' , by deleting the words " to prepare and bring in a bill , in accordance with Standing Order 68 ( 5 ) '' , and by adding after the words " and that the Committee be instructed '' , the words " to report to the House '' .
all in all , this amendment is very legalistic , very much in lawyer ' s jargon , if I can put it that way , but it is aimed at striking a committee .
the committee could examine the entire question in a very clear way , report back to the House , and then the government could follow up on it by bringing in a bill , which would be along the lines of the recommendations made by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to take part in the debate tonight .
this is an example of the House working at its best , where there is reasoned and intelligent debate .
certainly we will not all agree with the hon. member for Burnaby - Douglas , but who am I quoting when I say " We do not argue his right to stand up and debate the issue or argue his case .
we certainly would not deny the member that ? "
the debate reminds me of the abortion debate .
i know there are at least a couple of members on this side of the House who were here during that debate in 1989 .
i was a member of Parliament at that time .
i often say I am very fashionable because I am a recycled member of Parliament .
i was here in a previous life in the 34 th parliament and I spoke on that issue .
this reminds me of that debate .
it was one of those issues that I do not think the government wanted to bring to the floor of the House of Commons .
that was understandable .
obviously there were two sides to that debate as there are with this one .
i think that is reflected in the supreme court rulings that have come down on cases like this one .
one of them is the Sue Rodriguez case the member for Burnaby - Douglas quoted .
he was very much attached to that case and to Sue Rodriguez herself .
i do not always agree with the member .
he took a very courageous stand in defence of his position .
Ms. Rodriguez died before that ruling came down but the fact that they ruled 5:4 on that case indicates that even the supreme court is divided on the issue .
Canadians are looking for parliament to give them guidance .
it is incumbent on us to do that and to bring this issue before the House of Commons for intelligent debate .
i do not support the idea of spending money on a committee .
the Senate did that .
the Senate struck its committee .
a couple of the members have mentioned the cost of that study .
it becomes very expensive .
the secret to the whole process lies right here in the House of Commons .
all members of Parliament are going to be here .
they are paid to be here .
they are paid to stand and present their positions .
that is what I think should happen .
an intelligent , reasonable , persuasive debate should take place in the House .
i want to define euthanasia .
i am sure there are people back home , including myself until I took the time to study the issue , who are a little confused on what the term means .
i will quote from a fact book that was put together for me and other members a number of years ago by the Campaign Life Coalition .
this is basically a definition that Canadians should hear .
the original Greek meaning of the term euthanasia is easy or good death .
over time this meaning has been lost so that today an acceptable definition of euthanasia would be to act or fail to act so as to cause the death of a human being for the purpose of relieving suffering .
the victim is usually though not exclusively a chronically or terminally ill patient , not necessarily imminently dying .
the person performing the act of euthanasia is usually but not exclusively a health care professional .
the participation of the medical profession in these acts has led to the use of the term medicalized killing .
as well as the understanding of the precise definition of euthanasia it is important to be clear on which medically based decisions at the end of life should never be classified as euthanasia .
it is important that we listen to this carefully because allowing a terminally ill person at the last stages of life to die a natural death is not euthanasia .
where the situation is medically hopeless , a decision not to provide or continue extraordinary or heroic measures where such no longer offer any hope for healing is ethical , legal and consistent with standard medical practice .
it is important to remember that .
more important , it is also consistent with thousands of years of religious belief and practice .
the purpose is to examine present law to decide whether or not it should be changed .
that is what the member is asking .
we do not disagree with that .
it is just a case of bringing debate to the House of Commons and working through it in an intelligent fashion .
the views of the respective individuals are interesting when we are engaged in discussion .
there are some areas about which we fundamentally agree .
there are some areas about which we fundamentally disagree .
this is the place where that debate has to happen .
i urge all members to go home and do some research .
in time hopefully this issue will come to the floor of the House where it deserves to be .
earlier I mentioned the abortion debate which took place in the House .
i remember as a member of Parliament at that time that I had to do some soul searching on the issue .
i remember saying in the House that according to my definition if life begins at conception life should be allowed to continue .
as a parallel to that , if we are talking about human life and we have accepted the fact that life is there , what right do we have as individuals to determine when that life should end ?
that goes back to the fundamentals .
we are talking about the continuation of human life or the termination of human life .
it is about the continuation of life .
we have all had loved ones who have been terminally ill .
i am sure many times the thought has run through the minds of many loved ones concerning whether or not there should be euthanasia .
at the end of the day I think most Canadians would say it is an issue worthy of debate .
it is worthy of debate and it is worthy of consideration .
let us bring it to the floor of the House so that all concerned members will have a chance to speak on it .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Berthier - Montcalm is in order .
accordingly , the debate is on the amendment .
Mr. Clifford Lincoln ( Lac - Saint - Louis , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , could you tell me if I have three minutes or six minutes in which to speak .
i was told the debate ended at 7.06 p.m.
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
if the hon. member will begin , we will advise him of when he must end .
Mr. Clifford Lincoln :
first of all , Mr. Speaker , let me express the deep respect I feel for my colleague for Burnaby - Douglas .
i appreciate that very much , as I am sure members on all sides do .
where I feel we should draw the line and where I disagree fundamentally with those who believe that assisted suicide and euthanasia should be a fact of life is with respect to the deliberate use of whatever means there are to terminate a life .
who are we to decide that we can terminate a life ?
i could cite many cases if I had time .
i could cite the case of my brother who was given up for dead a few years ago and who now lives a thriving life .
i would like to conclude by quoting from Drs .
instead , we would be licensing the right to abuse and exploit the fears of the ill and depressed .
we would be -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member will have the floor when debate resumes .
adjournment PROCEEDINGS
a motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved
mefloquine
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canadian troops in Somalia were administered the experimental drug mefloquine .
military doctors got the antimalarial drug because they agreed to participate in a prelicensing safety monitoring study .
they ignored their commitment .
the Minister of Health was asked on October 20 if any action under the Food and Drug Act had been taken by his department against either the manufacturer who was responsible for supervising the safety monitoring study or the surgeon general who acted illegally in prescribing the drug .
the minister and his department are responsible for the administration of the Food and Drug Act .
they ignored the fact that military doctors used an unlicensed drug that commonly has neuropsychiatric side effects .
it is a drug the World Health Organization has expressed concerns about , and I quote from a World Health Organization document :
mefloquine is taken out of recommendations , based mainly on the concern about the neuropsychiatric side effects of mefloquine .
such side effects are relatively rare , but were considered a particular concern in military personnel .
the World Health Organization withdrew its support for the military use of the drug in April 1992 , long before Canadian troops were sent to Africa .
but this is not simply about whether the World Health Organization withdrew its support for the use of mefloquine by military personnel before soldiers were ordered to take it .
it is about what the Department of Health did after learning the law had been broken .
the minister did not explain what action his department took in 1993 when it learned of the problems in Somalia .
the minister did not explain why his department took part in a cover - up of the illegal use of mefloquine .
officials in the Department of Health believed in 1993 there was a direct connection between the use of mefloquine and the death of Somali teenager Shidane Arone and the attempted suicide of Master Corporal Clayton Matchee .
wrong .
DND ignored the law and ignored critical evidence from reputable source which I would be happy to make available to the minister .
furthermore , the minister asked the House to await the outcome of continuing investigations before coming to any judgment .
officials at the Department of Health told us on October 20 and 21 that no research is being undertaken by either the Department of Health or DND .
can the minister tell this House whether his officials are mistaken or whether he was mistaken when he informed the House that there were continuing investigations ?
i hope this minister is not trying to continue the cover - up of this illegal use of the unlicensed drug or to protect officials who had licensed mefloquine in 1993 at about the time the notorious events in Somalia became public .
the licensing was done based on an incomplete safety monitoring study .
telling this House there is an investigation under way into mefloquine when his own officials deny any study is now under way does not help us get to the truth .
the Minister of Health did not acknowledge the drug was used illegally .
instead , the minister said there was an ongoing investigation .
presumably he is talking about an investigation that has been ongoing since 1993 . If so , even the minister ' s infamous Airbus investigation did not take that long .
i would ask again whether the minister can tell the House whether his officials are mistaken or whether he was mistaken when he informed the House there were continuing investigations .
furthermore , I would ask that he document for the House what action his department has taken with regard to the illegal use of mefloquine by the surgeon general and the failure by the manufacturer to carry out a proper safety monitoring study .
Mr. Joseph Volpe ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to respond to the hon. member regarding the antimalaria drug lariam mefloquine and its availability to the Canadian Armed Forces in Somalia .
as he knows , lariam has been and continues to be used and recognized worldwide as one of the most effective drugs for the prevention and treatment of a form of malaria resistant to most other antimalarial drugs .
estimated at over 2 million deaths each year , malaria is one of the world ' s greatest killers .
prior to its marketing approval in 1993 , lariam was available to travelling Canadians through an open access clinical trial , referred to as a safety monitoring study .
the study provided Canadians with early access to a drug where few alternatives were available and monitored potential side effects of the drug in the interests of patient safety .
in 1994 Health Canada took immediate and affirmative action when media reported claims of several incidents where lariam may have been involved in Somalia .
the Department of Health requested the sponsor to provide all information and adverse drug reaction reports as required under the safety monitoring study .
according to Health Canada directives , researchers involved in clinical studies and attending physicians are bound to report without any exception any significant adverse reaction to drugs .
the results of the monitoring study on drug safety , combined with recent information in scientific literature , confirm the prescribing information approved by Health Canada for Lariam .
the decision to use Lariam as a first choice therapy is a matter of responsibility for the patient .
it is for the prescribing physician to decide in consultation with the patient whether a drug ' s potential benefits outweigh the risks .
i am sorry I could not answer .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member for Burnaby - Douglas .
foreign AID
Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , on October 21 , I asked a question in this House of the Minister of Foreign Affairs concerning the upcoming peoples summit , specifically the concern that many delegates from APEC countries who wish to attend the peoples summit to speak on issues of fundamental human rights , the rights of workers and the environment were refused any federal government funding .
i asked the foreign minister why it was that this explicit bar on the peoples summit , using federal funds to assist people from civil society attending the peoples summit , was in place .
i pointed out the double standard and the fact that the federal government is spending something in excess of $ 50 million for the APEC summit itself for things like security for leaders like Suharto and Cheung Chi Min and others and it is not prepared to provide the very minimal funding which has been requested to assist in the travel of delegates from APEC countries to the peoples summit .
now that the Minister of Finance has triumphantly proclaimed that the deficit has been wrestled to the ground , I urged that the minister responsible for foreign affairs , the Minister for International Co - operation , cancel the proposed 8 % cut , about $ 150 million , which is planned for next April in Canada ' s overseas development aid .
unfortunately the response to both those questions was completely unsatisfactory .
i point out that as well in the context of the upcoming APEC peoples summit my colleague from Yukon raised very serious concerns about the failure of the federal government to provide requested financial assistance to the APEC women ' s conference , this despite the commitment that was made by the secretary of state for women and multiculturalism at the conference in Beijing .
the failure to provide proper funding has also led to the cancellation of the indigenous peoples forum .
the peoples summit is a tremendous opportunity for Canadians and for people in APEC countries to raise concerns about human rights , about workers rights , about the environment , and I want to pay tribute to the organizers of the upcoming peoples summit in Vancouver later this month .
i want to again appeal to the Government of Canada to honour its own policy , the policy of CIDA , which encourages the involvement of delegates from other countries in important UN conferences and other key intergovernmental and non - governmental fora .
they have much to witness ; workers from Hong Kong , for example , who will speak about the failure of the Government of China to respect workers rights .
it just cancelled the laws passed by the Hong Kong legislature to guarantee freedom of association .
it is important that we hear from workers there .
it is important that we hear from workers in Indonesia and from others talking about the genocidal policies of Suharto in East Timor .
why are we allowing him to come to Canada when he is guilty of crimes against humanity ?
these are some of the questions that I hope will be addressed at the People ' s Summit .
i appeal to the government to provide the funding necessary to those who are coming -
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Cooperation , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the People ' s Summit requested that the Government of Canada pay $ 140,000 for the travel of Asia - Pacific NGOs to Vancouver .
after careful review the government decided that the best way to support the People ' s Summit is to provide funding support for policy discussions , not travel .
and this is what we did .
the Government of Canada has provided $ 195,000 to the People ' s Summit ; $ 170,000 to help cover in - Canada logistical and administrative costs related to the organization of the event ; and $ 25,000 to assist the People ' s Summit in developing an interactive Internet - based electronic conference that will provide a forum for an exchange of views .
the Government of Canada is the People ' s Summit largest contributor .
it supports the People ' s Summit because it includes a broad base group of Canadian and Asia - Pacific NGOs and will feature discussions on topics such as women , sustainability , youth and free media .
as chair of APEC in 1997 , Canada has done more than any other member to widen the scope of APEC discussions to include such questions .
canada has a longstanding tradition of supporting organizations involved in promoting human rights - an important Canadian foreign policy objective - and has always sought to ensure that APEC ' s activities are informed by the views of civil society , including academics and non - governmental representatives .
canada will continue to so .
CIDA is already supporting several of the organizations involved in the People ' s Summit for their ongoing work in developing countries .
fisheries
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , on October 28 I had the opportunity to rise in the House and ask a question of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans .
quite frankly I thought the question was fairly simple .
obviously the answers were not quite as simple because they were not forthcoming .
i would like to give the House a little background .
it is fishermen operated and those people who ply their trade in the Northwest Territories , Alberta , Saskatchewan , Manitoba and northern Ontario are the stakeholders of this corporation .
the concept is fairly simple .
the fishermen catch the fish , the marketing board markets the fish and sells them throughout the world and domestically .
it has sales in excess of $ 50 million on world - wide distribution .
it is a typical board .
it has no government subsidies .
it works extremely well and it is self - sufficient .
it also has working for it a chief executive officer and president .
the current president and chief executive officer has been with the corporation for 16 years .
he worked his way up as controller , vice - president of finance and then became the president and general manager , which is what we would all like to do within our corporation .
everything is fine .
this is where the sinister of music comes in because unfortunately the government has the ability to appoint the CEO under the Freshwater Fish Marketing Act .
previous history showed that this particular CEO had extended to him contracts of two and three years .
unfortunately , in April 1997 , just before the election , an extension of that contract was issued for only six months , which was a bit strange .
after the June election the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced that there was going to be a new president and general manager and he would be Mr. Ron Fewchuk .
would he also tell me if he consulted with the board and the chairman with respect to that appointment ?
well , I did not get an answer .
what I got was some gobbledegook but let me tell you what the answer is .
the fact of the matter is that the qualifications of Mr. Fewchuk are that he did not run in that riding because he let another member , a fellow by the name of Jon Gerrard who is no longer with the Liberal benches , run in his stead .
he retired as a member of Parliament .
did they ask the board and the chairman ?
did they consult with them ?
the answer is no , they did not consult with the board or the chairman .
it was simply a matter of a political appointment .
my second question was quite simple as well .
my question to the minister was would he simply tell me that the one salary of patronage would be paid for out of the budget of the minister of fisheries .
i never got an answer to that question either and I hope I can get one this evening .
the problem I have with this is not just simply for the Freshwater Fish Marketing Board , but we are dealing with another bill right now , Bill C - 4 .
i am wondering which one of those will be appointed the CEO of the Canadian Wheat Board .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I might say on Bill C - 4 that what we are trying to do is come up with a bill which producers have asked for .
they continue to want us to be able to appoint the expertise in marketing that we did under the last bill .
is there no depth to the disrespect for a political opponent to which the member for Brandon - Souris will stoop for cheap political gain ?
the member opposite has nothing of substance to say .
he reverts to an attack on the character of the individual in an effort to belittle the individual Mr. Ron Fewchuk .
although I am responding to this question on behalf of the government in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Mr. Fewchuk happened to be my seatmate in the last Parliament .
Mr. Fewchuk as a member of Parliament was not loud nor bombastic .
he did not use malicious comments to attract headlines like the member opposite is trying to do .
he did not try to manipulate the media like the member opposite is trying to do .
he held a quiet conviction and he did his job .
Mr. Fewchuk brings years of experience to the job of president and will serve the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation very well indeed .
he is a skilled entrepreneur and former parliamentarian with diverse experience in business and local government .
he has 18 years ongoing experience as a successful business owner - operator and 16 years experience as a commercial bait fisherman and outfitter .
he has a long history of local leadership , including 15 years of elected service as reeve , deputy reeve and councillor of the rural municipality of St. Clements .
he is well qualified .
program FOR OLDER WORKERS ADJUSTMENT
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , on October 29 I asked the Minister of Human Resources Development a question in this House .
what the workers , the employer , Jean Dup 茅 r 茅 , and Louise Harel of the Quebec government want is a pre - retirement program for these older employees .
the minister insists on offering only active measures , namely the transitional job fund , measures for independent workers and the purchase of courses .
try asking Edgar Rousseau , 56 , of Coleraine to take a course in electricity or soldering , for example .
try asking Normand Cloutier , 56 , an electrician who knows his job inside out , Louis - Philippe Roy , 56 , or Maurice Gr 茅 goire , 54 , an experienced dynamiter , to train for some other type of work .
you will agree with me that , for these people , training would be totally meaningless .
the minister has no compassion for these workers .
on October 27 , 1997 , I asked him a question in the House and he did not even dare to come to the defence of his government ' s treatment of these workers .
instead , he designated the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs .
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs has now replaced the Minister of Human Resources Development .
employees of the BC mine met last week with the Minister of Human Resources Development .
Andr 茅 Lalibert 茅 , Ga 茅 tan Rousseau and Charles Lacroix from the Thetford region met with him in his office .
they asked him for an improved POWA program .
the next day , in this House , he dared to rise in his place and state that asbestos workers had told him they did not want the POWA program .
at that point , my colleague , the member for Rimouski - Mitis , tabled a letter in the House reminding the minister that the workers wanted an improved POWA program .
this minister has no compassion .
jean Dup 茅 r 茅 , I remind the House , is prepared to do his share , a substantial share , he says .
he is prepared to go as far as $ 3 million in active measures .
does he not understand that forcing workers who are 55 , 56 , 58 or 59 years old , to sit in a classroom is not only unrealistic , but stupid coming from a minister who claims to manage this country ' s human resources ?
it is not surprising -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Cooperation .
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the for International Cooperation , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the minister is sensitive , open and always willing to listen to Canadians .
the federal government recognizes the difficulties experienced by Canadians who lose their jobs , particularly those affected by the closing of the mine in Black Lake , in Quebec .
however , these layoffs cannot be covered by the Program for Older Workers Adjustment , or POWA .
that program was terminated last March because , among other things , it was not fair and equitable to older workers in Quebec and across Canada .
the Department of Human Resources Development Canada has changed its focus from passive income support to active measures in order to help workers reintegrate into the workforce .
provinces are also moving in that direction .
i assure the member this decision was not taken lightly and we will continue to help Canadians affected by layoffs in the best way possible .
with regard to Lab Chrysotile , this is reflected in the generous offer of close to $ 3 million made by our government to help the employees at the BC mine re - enter the workforce .
people will benefit from adequate active measures including self - employment , targeted wage subsidies and skill development , which will increase the employability of these people and help them re - enter the workforce as quickly as possible .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted .
accordingly , this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
( the House adjourned at 7.30 p.m. )

house OF COMMONS
Wednesday , November 5 , 1997
the House met at 2 p.m.
prayers
the Speaker :
as is our practice on Wednesday we will now sing O Canada , and we will be led by the hon. member for Edmonton East .
statements BY MEMBERS
WINNIPEG BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB
Mr. Reg Alcock ( Winnipeg South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to draw the attention of the House today to the Winnipeg Boys and Girls Club and its Floodbusters program .
after the flood that Winnipeg suffered this summer , the department of human resources and the Winnipeg Boys and Girls Club got together and organized a program that hired 193 students .
they worked all summer long cleaning up properties and helping homeowners repair their homes .
they removed some 400,000 sandbags .
they ran a summer camp for kids displaced by the flood so their parents could work on their properties .
when the Red Cross was having trouble getting relief out , 12 members of the Floodbusters team worked with the Red Cross to ensure people got the compensation they needed .
the program was run by Mike Owens , executive director of the Winnipeg Boys and Girls Club , and Heather Popoff who actually directed the program .
they did a superb job .
i would like all members of the House to congratulate them .
* * *
sports
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , why strike a subcommittee to study sports in Canada ?
is it because our national passion , hockey , is going south ?
do we need a study to know the NHL is a multi - billion dollar , multinational business funded by $ 80 tickets , special viewing box seats and TV revenue from mass markets ?
NHL owners and players are pricing hockey out of its cradle , our home , Canada .
the study is either a waste of time or a blank cheque .
why are we doing it ?
Canadians are proud of their athletes but this study will do nothing to support -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Parkdale - High Park .
* * *
environment
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , on October 30 I held the first of a series of pre - budget consultation meetings with the constituents of Parkdale - High Park .
the message I received is that they are proud of the hard work done by the government that has resulted in today ' s healthy economic environment .
Canadians in my riding want the government to stay the course and continue the process of debt reduction and fiscal restraint .
we are all looking forward to the elimination of the deficit during this Parliament .
my constituents have told me that we should reinvest any surplus dividend in health care , education , youth employment and the environment .
as well , my constituents would like to see continuing support for small business .
it may interest my hon. colleagues across the floor to learn that we did not talk about sweeping tax cuts .
Canadians , especially those in Ontario , know too well the real costs of these tax cuts borne by them in the areas of the health care system and the education of their children .
they are not willing to pay this huge price for political pandering .
* * *
veterans AFFAIRS
Mr. Maurice Godin ( Ch 芒 teauguay , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , today the Bloc Quebecois expresses its thanks to all those who served in the army , navy , air force and merchant marine , all the nurses and all of the other men and women who risked their lives , or gave their lives , to enable us to overcome tyranny .
as the years pass , and the veterans of that time get older and pass on , each new generation has a duty to perpetuate the memory of their sacrifice and courage .
on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois , I honour the women and men who gave their lives to defend freedom and democracy during the two world wars , the Korean war and the numerous UN peacekeeping missions .
we salute you all .
* * *
KOREAN WAR VETERANS
Mr. George Proud ( Hillsborough , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this year ' s Remembrance Day poster honours our Korean War veterans .
today on the first day of Veterans Week I think it is appropriate that we pause and give some thought to the sacrifices made by these veterans .
for those who fought in it , the Korean War was as bloody and dreadful as the two world wars that preceded it .
we should remember that when we joined 15 other nations to resist enemy aggression , Canada was the third largest contributor to the multinational force .
in all , over 26,000 Canadians served in Korea , 1,558 became casualties , of whom 516 died .
in the Memorial Chamber in the Peace Tower hon. members will find the names of those 516 Canadians in the Korean Book of Remembrance .
it is our great loss that they did not make it home .
may they rest in peace .
* * *
lest WE FORGET
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , on November 6 , 1997 a resident of my riding , Margaret McKenna , will make a trip to Belgium for what is truly a sober reminder of the sacrifice made for us during World War II.
Margaret McKenna ' s eldest brother , Jack Summerhayes , was a gunner on a 426 squadron Halifax bomber , which was shot down on the night of May 12 , 1944 over Belgium .
thanks in part to the efforts of the Canadian and Belgian governments and the Belgium Aviation History Association , on September 6 of this year Pilot Officer Jack Summerhayes was found in a Belgian swamp still at his post .
jack Summerhayes and two other crew members also trapped in the bomber will be buried alongside the five other other crew members who perished that night in 1944 .
as we approach Remembrance Day , may the pilgrimage of Margaret McKenna and the other Canadians travelling to Belgium to bury their loved ones some 53 years after their deaths serve as a statement that we as Canadians will never forget the supreme sacrifice they made .
* * *
lieutenant COLONEL BILLY BARKER
Mr. Inky Mark ( Dauphin - Swan River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , we can tell much about a country by its heroes and how it treats them .
Billy Bishop called him the deadliest air fighter who ever lived .
this forgotten Canadian hero was the first president of the Toronto Maple Leafs and first acting director of the Royal Canadian Air Force .
canada , it is time to give Lieutenant Colonel Billy Barker , VC , this Canadian hero from Dauphin , Manitoba , the recognition he deserves .
* * *
premier OF NOVA SCOTIA
Mr. Joe McGuire ( Egmont , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is my great pleasure to congratulate the Premier of Nova Scotia , Russell MacLellan , on his election yesterday in the riding of Sydney North .
Russell was the choice of his party and the people to be Premier of Nova Scotia .
Russell is an 18 year veteran of this place where he made his mark as a parliamentarian noted for his honesty and integrity , a great representative of his province and as a man of the people in all his deliberations .
we wish Russell well on his victory and that of his colleague Dr. Ed Kinley in Halifax Citadel .
these victories bode well for a re - election of the Liberal government in Nova Scotia in the next few months .
* * *
the ENVIRONMENT
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu 茅 bec , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , at a Liberal fundraising dinner at $ 325 a plate , the Prime Minister emphasized that Ottawa would not be arriving in Kyoto empty - handed .
but what is going on , really ?
canada is the only G - 7 country without a specific target to propose at the Kyoto conference .
has the Prime Minister forgotten that Canada made the commitment at the Rio Summit in 1992 to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 ?
his government has , moreover , maintained that commitment , particularly by inaugurating a set of voluntary measures in 1995 .
the outcome : the Royal Society of Canada estimates that , by the year 2000 , greenhouse gas emissions will be 9.5 % over the 1990 reference level .
this wait - and - see attitude , backed up with virtually no strategy whatsoever , contradicts the Prime Minister ' s statement that " If we are really concerned about the next century - "
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Vaudreuil - Soulanges .
* * *
QUEBEC PREMIER
Mr. Nick Discepola ( Vaudreuil - Soulanges , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , once again we have a fine example of the " Do as I say not as I do " politics of the sovereignist government of Lucien Bouchard .
this is how Le Devoir put it in its headline " Quebec City imposes its aid on Montreal '' .
Lucien Bouchard is very good at accusing others of meddling , but I would like to know what his government is up to if it is not meddling in the management of the City of Montreal .
his government is going back on its promise in the financial agreement and is now telling the mayor of Montreal how to manage his city .
Montreal is , to all intents and purposes , under protection .
i put the question again : should we not look askance at any partnership Mr. Bouchard might propose to Canada ?
* * *
environment
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , in 1966 the Liberal government rushed the sale of nuclear Candu reactors to China without following the rules laid out in the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act .
back then the Liberal government showed a complete lack of respect for the safety of citizens .
the Liberals have done it again .
now they are trying to push another Candu sale , this time to Turkey .
the Liberal government is kidding itself if it thinks that setting up a sham of a shallow assessment will stop the lid from blowing sky high on this issue .
it is another sneaky backroom political deal .
the recent decision by Ontario Hydro to shut down seven operating reactors proves that safety concerns better be addressed before we sell these things to other countries .
to add even more insult to Canadians the Liberal government is using taxpayers ' money to finance these deals .
* * *
contaminated EARTH
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , PCB contaminated earth from Toronto is on its way to the Saguenay - Lac - Saint - Jean area with the permission of Lucien Bouchard ' s PQ government but without the permission of the people there and the people of Quebec , who were not consulted .
fifty thousand tonnes amounts to some 2,000 trucks a year or 10 trucks arriving every work day in Saint - Ambroise with a load of contaminated earth after passing through a number of towns and villages in Quebec .
the danger facing the people of Saint - Ambroise is that tomorrow it could be 100,000 tonnes of earth and 4,000 trucks a year .
it is a former minister of the environment in Ottawa who is responsible for the shipment of contaminated earth from Toronto to the Saguenay - Lac - Saint - Jean area without complying with the Quebec regulations on holding public hearings .
* * *
rights OF CHILDREN
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Oslo conference on child labour reflects a growing concern about the urgent need to end the economic exploitation of children .
speaker after speaker at this conference identified the liberalization of trade agreements as a key cause of the escalation of this worldwide problem .
statistics show there are 250 million child labourers in the world .
many work in conditions that jeopardize their health , their safety and their social and moral development .
our party believes that governments and consumers in developed nations can and should use their influence to put pressure on those who exploit child labour .
we believe the Canadian government should pass legislation similar to the Harken bill in the United States which would ban the importation of goods made by child labour .
canada should join the other nations of the world in signing ILO convention No. 138 which limits the minimum age of workers entering the workforce .
canada should not enter into any international trade agreements that do not clearly outline acceptable labour standards .
* * *
smelting INDUSTRY
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabasca , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , earlier in the week , Magnola , a smelting company and a subsidiary of Noranda , announced the construction of a $ 720 million magnesium smelter in Asbestos .
this project will create 1,000 jobs during the construction phase and 350 once the smelter is in operation .
as a result of this announcement , Quebec and Canada will become the second largest magnesium producer in the world .
having held the office of mayor of Asbestos until June 2 , I hasten to congratulate the people at Magnola , as well as all the players in the social and economic development of Asbestos .
this very good news does credit to the people of my hometown of Asbestos , my riding , my province , Quebec , and the country as a whole .
* * *
reform PARTY
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , over the past several weeks I have listened to my Reform colleagues make accusations about financial contributors to my party .
i listened to them challenge the credibility of the prime minister , who happens to be the most respected politician in Canada .
fund - raising , mining .
fund - raising , mining .
i wonder if Canadians realize that many thousands of dollars donated to the Leader of the Opposition came directly from these same mining companies .
talk about representing a special interest group .
reformers should be ashamed .
there is no end to their hypocrisy .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
the ENVIRONMENT
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , for weeks now the Liberals have refused to reveal what their position is on greenhouse gas emissions .
the countdown to Kyoto is just 26 days now and yet the Liberals have resorted to empty rhetoric , saying and pretending they are the only Canadians who really care about mother earth .
yeah , right .
i would like to ask the prime minister this question .
why did the government ignore its own environmental laws and sell reactors to China and Turkey without the proper environmental assessments ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the affirmation of the hon. lady is not true .
we have followed Canadian regulations .
the law permitted us to do what we did .
we believe that exporting Candu reactors is very important for the Canadian economy .
it is extremely important for countries which will use the electricity generated by nuclear power to replace coal , which is causing a lot of climate problems .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , this government bypassed the entire process .
the only environmental assessment that the Liberals are doing for these nuclear plants is some meaningless shadow assessment .
the deal has already been approved for these reactor plants .
it does not matter what the government does .
no nuclear reactor would ever be allowed in Canada with this meaningless , shallow shadow assessment .
what a double standard .
why does the prime minister pretend to be Mr. Green Thumb at home here in Canada and yet around the world he is known as Mr. Uranium ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , again the Reform Party is up in the House of Commons .
when this bill was before the House of Commons Reform members voted against it .
they did not want to have anything at all .
this bill called for assessments to be done according to the laws of Canada and they voted against it .
now they dare to get up in the House .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am dead serious about quoting from the second Liberal red book : " Domestic action alone is not enough to protect Canada ' s environment .
ensuring a healthy environment for Canadians is a major foreign policy goal '' .
there is no such thing with nuclear reactor plants in China and Turkey .
i want to ask the prime minister once again , can he stand in his place here today and say that he is proud of being known as Mr. Recycle in Canada when he is actually known as Mr. Radioactive in China and Turkey ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am happy to know that they are against nuclear energy .
i am happy to know that members of the Reform Party do not appreciate the fact that we have developed in Canada the safest system in the world for nuclear energy with the Candu reactor .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the prime minister stood in the House and made the ridiculous claim that he gives a damn about the environment .
let us take a look at his damn , China ' s Three Gorges Dam .
while in opposition the current environment minister condemned Canada ' s involvement in the project , calling it " the world ' s largest disaster '' , but his own government is financing at least $ 153 million in loans for the Three Gorges Dam .
can the prime minister explain his own government ' s damn hypocrisy ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , with respect to AECL and its business around the world , as a matter of policy the Atomic Energy Corporation of Canada Ltd. conducts an environmental analysis of all its projects .
in relation to the bid process , which is still under way in Turkey , one of the bid specifications was the complete satisfaction of all relevant environmental regulations and assessments .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , nice answer , but it is completely irrelevant .
i was asking about Three Gorges Dam .
the government wants to punish the Canadian taxpayer with the Kyoto deal when it turns out it does not give a damn about the environment .
why will the prime minister not admit the closest he has ever come to a green policy is on the golf course ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , again they do not have a position .
we want to do what is important for Canada .
the only thing the Reform Party is proposing is to do nothing .
we will not listen to the Reform Party .
we will do what is right .
the Speaker :
colleagues , I wonder if I might ask you to please back away from using the word damn .

drinking WATER
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Minister of Health claimed that he had " the support of all the provinces to introduce " Bill C - 14 on drinking water .
the Government of Quebec , however , has never given its support for this bill .
will the minister admit that he has never had the agreement of any minister of the Government of Quebec to go ahead with Bill C - 14 on drinking water ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , obviously things are getting seriously diluted .
everyone knows that it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Bloc Quebecois to justify its presence here in Ottawa .
every day , it looks for significant problems .
today , the focus is water .
it is truly bizarre .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , If the minister wants to wade in , I will give him a tip : he should start by answering the questions .
i repeat my question to the plumber of health .
did he receive the support of a minister of the Government of Quebec before saying that he had Quebec ' s support in tabling Bill C - 14 ?
there is nothing watered down about that , that is a question he should understand .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the subject matter of Bill C - 14 is entirely within federal jurisdiction .
we have fully respected the jurisidiction of the provinces .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question to the Minister of Health will be clear and simple .
could he tell us whether or not he has the Quebec government ' s approval to go ahead with Bill C - 14 ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the answer is yes .
let me quote a letter from the Quebec health minister dated May 2 last year , stating that " from a public health protection point of view , we have no problem with this bill being enacted '' .
that is the answer given by the Quebec health minister .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the minister is referring to a bill from the last Parliament .
bill C - 14 was introduced last Friday .
does he have the Quebec government ' s approval specifically for Bill C - 14 , which is before us now ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I plan to share the contents of this letter with the hon. member .
i have a copy here for him .
the hon. member cannot get around the fact that the Government of Quebec was in agreement .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
the Speaker :
i would ask you not to do that .
* * *
the ENVIRONMENT
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the prime minister .
just hours before the Liberals called the spring election cabinet pulled another fast one on Canadians , approving $ 1.5 billion in financing and agreeing to circumvent an environmental assessment of a Candu reactor sale to Turkey .
in six years this reactor reported 1,100 nuclear incidents .
politically unstable , Turkey has a disturbing human rights record and it is an alarmingly high credit risk .
how does this sordid deal promote environmental safety abroad and Canada ' s good reputation in the world community ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , if and when AECL is successful in its bid and actually negotiates a contract to sell a Candu reactor to Turkey it will of course comply with all applicable Canadian standards and Turkish requirements .
those Turkish requirements are in fact one of the very bid specifications .
as a matter of policy AECL conducts an environmental analysis of all its projects .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I hope the prime minister will address this question .
ever since he was energy minister 13 years ago , the prime minister has been bound and determined to sell nuclear technology to Turkey .
now he is at it again .
can the prime minister not find a better way to rack up club Kyoto points than spending billions of dollars to promote the sale of nuclear technology to an economically and politically unstable country like Turkey ?
hon. Sergio Marchi ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the member obviously has a very profound misunderstanding about the whole financing .
second , Canada has sold thus far nine nuclear reactors .
the Canadian public has not lost one cent on any repayment .
in fact , not only has it made money but it has also created jobs .
last , the state of Turkey is guaranteeing this loan and as a member of the OECD and as an ally in NATO and as a country that has kept up with its international repayment schedule -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Sherbrooke .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is difficult for the House to take the government seriously when the Minister of Natural Resources tells us that AECL is doing an environmental assessment on itself .
i would like to know from the Prime Minister , since he is ready to manipulate the courts and also circumvent the law by producing a secret shadow assessment on the Turkish deal , if a secret shadow assessment has been done on the China deal .
if yes , will he take it out of the shadows , allow it to glow in the dark and take the credit that he wants but that he does not deserve ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , everything was made public when we signed the deal with China .
everybody knows everything .
we always respect the law .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , when he was the environment critic in 1991 , today ' s finance minister said " I unconditionally support the principle of the environmental assessment legislation in Canada '' .
i guess he just does not support the practice .
he then went on to say " The environmental assessment process in this country must not be open to political manipulation '' .
if selling nuclear reactors to other countries without environmental assessment is not political manipulation of assessment laws , what is political manipulation ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as I have indicated , the policies of AECL are to conduct environmental analysis of all of its projects .
the bid projects from other countries around the world typically include environmental requirements with which AECL must comply .
finally , in terms of the application of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act , the hon. gentleman will know that is a matter of litigation at the present time and neither he nor I should comment until the litigation is complete .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
i ask him not to evade it or avoid it but to just answer it .
how is the government going to pay for the Kyoto deal , by raising the gas tax or by cutting into the surplus ?
which will it be ?
how is it going to pay for it ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we have a very good record .
we have run a good government and have managed to reduce the deficit to almost zero in four years .
therefore , we know how to manage the affairs of the nation .
among the responsibilities of the nation is to make a contribution to the problem of climate change , something the Reform Party does not want us to do .
we need to have a strong position because we believe in the protection of the environment on this side of the House .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I asked a straight question and I got another crooked answer .
why will the Prime Minister not tell us -
some hon. members :
sit down .
the Speaker :
we are pushing the envelope a little bit today .
the question , please .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the cabinet apparently made a decision to rack up costs on the Kyoto deal .
how is the government going to pay for it ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is exclusively the Reform Party that is talking about this doomsday scenario .
the hon. gentleman should know that there are a variety of ways by which the climate challenge can be addressed : by broadening and deepening the voluntary initiatives in the private sector which the private sector is already anxious to do ; strengthening energy efficiency , encouraging co - generation ; promoting science and technology and the commercialization of science and technology ; fostering renewables ; the whole point about jointed limitations ; the whole point about credits trading throughout the world .
all of those will be part of the equation .
canada will have a position that works .
* * *
drinking WATER
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Health has just been capitalizing on a letter dated May 2 , 1996 , in which , according to him , the Government of Quebec gave its agreement .
if the minister has read the letter , can he deny that what is written is the following : " I would like to inform you that it is the Ministry of the Environment and Wildlife that is responsible for water management .
it is the responsibility of that department to advise you of a definitive agreement on this legislative process '' ?
does the minister know how to read ?
does he still claim that he has the agreement of the Government of Quebec , as he has just stated ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the plumbing is still plugged .
some hon. members :
hon. Allan Rock :
it is too late now to protect the Bloc ' s position .
they made an enormous mistake .
we obtained the prior agreement of Quebec and of all the other provinces .
Mr. Louis Plamondon :
that ' s not true .
hon. Allan Rock :
may I quote a letter from the Quebec Public Health Branch , which says that the bill " is a positive element to protect public health '' .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , let ' s be serious .
we are in this House and we are speaking to the government .
the Minister of Health has no right to falsely interpret statements , as he is doing .
how can the Minister of Health claim to have the agreement of the Government of Quebec when his letter not only comes from the Department of Health but also states that it is up to the wildlife ministry -
some hon. members :
the Speaker :
dear colleagues , I would ask that you refrain from showing letters .
letters may be quoted , but you are asked not to display them like that .
i would ask the hon. member from Roberval to pose his question .
Mr. Michel Gauthier :
Mr. Speaker , my question is very simple .
is the minister aware of the letter signed by the present Deputy Minister of Health and sent to his environment colleague in Quebec , and of the denial by the Quebec Minister of the Environment of what the minister has just said in this House ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is really strange .
i simply read what Quebec government officials wrote about this bill .
some hon. members :
hon. Allan Rock :
the simple fact is that the provinces have jurisdiction over the quality of drinking water and that the federal government has the power to make laws concerning the materials used to transport water .
our bill deals with this and it is an area of federal jurisdiction .
* * *
visas
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration .
yesterday , former ambassador Joe Bissett issued his report into a Los Angeles visa office with regard to the issuing of a visa to a known triad gang leader .
the report contained 11 recommendations .
can the minister advise the House and all Canadians if she agrees with those recommendations ?
when will she enact those recommendations not only in Los Angeles but in all visa offices around the world ?
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , following a problem in the Los Angeles office , I personally asked the deputy minister to prepare a detailed report on the situation .
the deputy minister asked an outside consultant to review the processing procedures in our Los Angeles office .
we just received Mr. Bissett ' s report .
it includes some very interesting recommendations and we intend to follow up on them .
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , my supplementary question is for the same minister .
does the minister know today where the triad gang leader is ?
has her department issued a deportation order against the triad leader and his family ?
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Reform member is well aware that the Privacy Act precludes me from providing details on the private lives of those involved in any departmental matter .
* * *
nuclear REACTORS
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
yesterday evening , CBC National News announced that the federal government intends to fund the sale of two CANDU reactors to Turkey , to the tune of $ 1.5 billion , without conducting environmental impact studies .
can the Prime Minister explain why his government is prepared to circumvent its own legislation for the sole purpose of selling nuclear reactors to Turkey , while here in Ontario , nuclear reactors are being closed down because of the risks to the environment ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. gentleman should be careful of the aspersions he may cast with respect to the Candu technology around the world .
that technology has proven to be efficient and safe and is respected .
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , are we to understand that the federal government is prepared to do anything for money , including violating its own laws ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as I have already said , if and when AECL is successful in its bid and if and when it is successful in negotiating a contract subsequent to that bid , it will of course comply with all applicable Canadian standards and all applicable Turkish laws .
environmental specifications were a part of the bidding process imposed by Turkey .
in addition to that , AECL , as a matter of policy , has an environmental examination process that is built into every one of its projects .
* * *
the SENATE
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , Albertans mourn the untimely death of Senator Walter Twinn .
may I remind the Prime Minister that he said in 1990 " I pledge to work for a Senate that is elected '' .
will the Prime Minister keep his word and allow Albertans to elect their next senator ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we were for an elected Senate .
it was a proposition in the Charlottetown accord that the Reform Party campaigned against .
reformers want to have it both ways .
they did not want to make any compromises and they voted down an elected Senate .
i will name the next senator the same way as the father of the Leader of the Opposition was named .
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , this does not require constitutional change .
may I remind the Prime Minister that in Alberta the precedent has already been set .
the late Stan Waters was elected as senator to the Senate in 1989 .
now we have members of all sides of the Alberta legislature , including provincial Liberals , asking for an elected senator .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister of the land is obliged to respect the Constitution for Alberta and the provinces of Canada .
* * *
search AND RESCUE HELICOPTERS
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Public Works and Government Services .
the government will soon announce its decision regarding the purchase of 15 search and rescue helicopters , without having even debated the issue in Parliament .
will the government do what it usually does when a difficult decision must be made and announce its choice of helicopters on Friday afternoon or next week , when Parliament will not be sitting ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the process for the purchase of 15 helicopters has been unfolding for a long time .
we had four bidders whose names made the news .
we are currently studying the bids and once this review is completed , I will make recommendations to cabinet and a decision will be announced .
* * *
youth EMPLOYMENT
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Secretary of State for Western Economic Diversification .
Canadians know the importance of job creation for young Canadians and its impact on the future of the nation .
young people from Vancouver Kingsway want to know how western economic diversification has addressed the creation of jobs for youth in western Canada .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel ( Secretary of State ( Science , Research and Development ) ( Western Economic Diversification ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , western diversification has made great progress specifically targeted to young people .
the first area is in science and technology where it has created almost 100 jobs .
it hires young people to help small business -
some hon. members :
oh . Oh .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel :
Mr. Speaker , they are not interested in jobs .
it hires young people to help small business in science and technology .
second is the international trade personnel program which has enhanced exports and has created approximately 400 jobs .
third is the western youth entrepreneurial program that encourages young people to get involved and start out in small business .
it has created almost 500 jobs .

fisheries
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , Spanish overfishing off the east coast prompted this government to respond with guns and Captain Canada .
meanwhile on the west coast , Americans continue to overfish and continue to violate the Pacific salmon treaty and this government does nothing .
my question is for the Prime Minister .
why the double standard for British Columbians ?
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member comes from Vancouver Island , British Columbia and he should know better than to ask such a foolish question .
the fact is that the salmon resources on the west coast are shared between Canada and the United States .
to have a decision which will be lasting and in the best interests of fishermen of both countries and at the same time to protect conservation , it is essential to have a joint agreement with the Americans .
there is no other way of handling this matter except through an agreement which both sides feel is in their interests .
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am from British Columbia , just like the minister of fisheries .
i am representing the people of British Columbia and they are insulted to be called foolish .
they want action .
when is this minister going to get up off his seat and do something for the people of British Columbia ?
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , at the end of the day what counts is not the rhetoric in the House .
what counts is an agreement with the Americans .
we must have a lasting agreement that we have not had because of the flaws in the Mulroney treaty which was negotiated in 1985 .
instead of coming here and putting forth the comments he has , he should be supporting the process so we can get to an agreement which will solve the problem we face on the west coast .
Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the fisheries committee heard eloquent evidence from B.C. coastal communities and aboriginal people about the devastating socioeconomic impact of the Mifflin plan .
i want to ask a question of the Minister of Human Resources Development .
the Community Fisheries Development Centre has prepared an excellent active labour market transition plan costing $ 375 million over three years .
on the east coast fishery so far , $ 3.4 billion was spent .
i want to ask the minister to finally meet with representatives from British Columbia who are here today .
will he support their proposal and not give us more rhetoric ?
what will he finally -
the Speaker :
the hon. Minister of Human Resources Development .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my colleague , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans met with them yesterday .
i think it would be irresponsible to pit one region against another and make comparisons .
the situation in B.C. is serious but is on a different scale than the one we have in Atlantic Canada .
i think the member will grant that .
my department has already invested in a number of programs for the communities in British Columbia -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Bras d ' Or .
* * *
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources .
during a recent meeting with the auditor general , we were informed that a special examination of the crown corporation Devco will be concluding soon but only Devco ' s board of directors have the right to see the results of this audit .
taking into account the latest questionable activity of Devco ' s management , and on behalf of the members from the United Mine Workers of America who are in Ottawa today , will the minister live up to the standards of openness and accountability that his party campaigned on and table -
the Speaker :
the hon. Minister of Natural Resources .
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am sure the hon. member shares the sentiment expressed by the union , by the Government of Nova Scotia and by our government to have success stories related to Devco .
the special examination is part of the process to try to ensure that the corporation is operating in a correct and proper basis .
the study is being conducted by the auditor general .
when the report is prepared , it will be handled in the appropriate way according to law .
i will take the hon. member ' s request under advisement .
* * *
environment
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy - Royal , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , when referring to Canada ' s position on greenhouse gas emissions , the Prime Minister said last week in this House " Our position will , I hope , be acceptable to all Canadians '' .
one month before Kyoto all they can do is cross their fingers and hope .
apparently it is a coin toss whether the Prime Minister impedes the progress of industry or negotiates away Canada ' s reputation as an environmental world leader .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government is committed to legally binding targets in Kyoto .
we are dealing with every partner in this country in reaching our goals and timetables .
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy - Royal , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question was quite precise .
i asked whether any positions derived from Kyoto would be subject to a vote in this House ?
that was the question I asked .
the Minister of the Environment has just stated that she has been in dialogue with her provincial counterparts .
next week on November 12 there is a meeting with the provincial energy ministers and provincial environment ministers and today they still do not know what the agenda for that meeting will be .
when will they know the agenda ?
what will be discussed ?
more important , they will be asked to sign on to a position that they have no idea -
the Speaker :
the hon. Minister of the Environment .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I and my colleagues are in constant dialogue with all the partners on this important agenda , including the provinces .
yes we will be meeting with the energy and environment ministers next week in Regina .
the agenda for that meeting is known to them .

customs TARIFF ACT
Mr. Janko Peric ( Cambridge , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Finance .
the Customs Tariff Act is currently before the House .
concerns have been raised by many , including Toyota in my riding of Cambridge , whether any changes will be made to the current tariff policy on imported automotive parts .
can the minister assure this House a level playing field for all auto manufacturers in the country , including Toyota -
the Speaker :
the hon. Minister of Finance .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member has been an extremely strong advocate for the interests of the auto makers in his riding .
i can assure him that the government will not remove the provision that permits duty free entry for auto parts used in vehicle assembly in Canada from the tariff simplification bill .
i can also assure him , as he has asked , that we sent a letter last week to the Canadian Motor Vehicle Manufacturers ' Association confirming this commitment .
* * *
IRAQ
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , Saddam Hussein is asking Canada to drop trade sanctions against Iraq .
the minister has two choices .
he can go with France and Russia and drop the sanctions , or he can go with the U.S. and stick with the sanctions .
does the minister have a position , or is he going to waffle like this government does on most issues ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the fact is that we stand four square behind the United Nations ' decision to have sanctions against Iraq .
* * *
bilingualism
Mr. Louis Plamondon ( Richelieu , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the President of the Treasury Board .
yesterday , the Commissioner of Official Languages stated that budget constraints had resulted in a 20 % reduction in the number of federal offices designated bilingual .
how can the President of the Treasury Board , himself a francophone , justify this kind of doublespeak on the part of his government , which claims to support French - speaking minorities while continuing to cut services ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
* * *
veterans AFFAIRS
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , for over 50 years the men and women who bravely served in Canada ' s wartime merchant navy have been treated as second class veterans , deprived of many of the benefits accorded veterans of other services .
the Minister of Veterans Affairs when questioned on this in the House yesterday referred to Bill C - 48 , which he knows full well excludes members of the merchant marine from many of the benefits received by others .
will the government show the veterans of the merchant marine the honour and respect they deserve before it is too late ?
hon. Fred Mifflin ( Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State ( Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ) , Lib . ) :
the hon. member , when he refers to this government , should know that the main agitators for that bill were three members of the opposition party , which was the Liberal Party , and a member of the NDP .
it was the initiative of those members which caused the government of the day to come across with a bill which basically allowed those brave merchant seamen to receive the same benefits as those veterans in uniform , including a veterans independence program -

the hon. member for Sherbrooke .

fisheries
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
it has to do with the west coast fishery .
i see he has just stepped out of the House .
i hope he will be able to join us again .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
the Speaker :
if the hon. member for Sherbrooke has a question , I would like him to put it now .
hon. Jean J . Charest :
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans in question period referred to envoys Ruckelshaus and Strangway .
both envoys met with Premier Clark last week and his advisory committee .
both envoys said they were ready to submit an interim report when there is a bilateral meeting between the Prime Minister and the President during the APEC conference .
will the government accept their offer and finally do something for the people on the west coast who want some action on this issue ?
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it was the hon. member ' s party which signed a treaty which is so defective that the annexes ran out after seven years .
there was no provision in it for continuing those annexes or for settling disputes .
his party signed that defective treaty which is the cause of our current problems .
Strangway and Ruckelshaus are able to report when they wish .
however , we will not make the same mistake that the Conservative Party made in putting on artificial deadlines .
that led the treaty to come forward to the shamrock summit when it was not ready .

points OF ORDER
tabling OF DOCUMENTS
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , according to citation 347 of Beauchesne ' s and according to the reference within that section to Standing Order 32 , there are two methods in this House by which documents can be tabled .
today during question period , documents were passed from the health minister to the leader of the third party and vice versa .
i would ask that those two documents be properly tabled in the House so that all of us can be aware of the contents .
i hope that that process does not occur again .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I know of no provision for tabling a document coming from an opposition member but in so far as the government document is concerned , I will endeavour to have it tabled before the end of the day .
the Speaker :
the hon. House leader for the Reform Party is accurate in what he says .
if ministers quote from documents , they should be tabled .
i would not like to see any minister using one of the pages during question period to bring a document across the floor of this House .
the pages are here to help us and they should not be brought into our debates or battles .
i take the word of the hon. government House leader that the documents that were quoted from will be tabled .
i urge him to have these tabled before the end of today ' s session .
routine PROCEEDINGS
interparliamentary DELEGATIONS
Mr. Bill Graham ( Toronto Centre - Rosedale , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise pursuant to Standing Order 34 ( 1 ) .
i have the honour to present to the House , in both official languages , the report of the Canada European Parliamentary Association to the sixth annual meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization of Security and Co - operation in Europe , the OSCE , which was held in Warsaw , Poland from July 5 to July 9 , 1997 .

committees OF THE HOUSE
foreign AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE
Mr. Bill Graham ( Toronto Centre - Rosedale , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the first report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade .
in accordance with its mandate under Standing Order 108 ( 2 ) , your committee has considered the fifth and seventh reports of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade presented to the House during the second session of the 35 th Parliament , entitled respectively " Ending Child Labour Exploitation , a Canadian Agenda for Action on Global Challenges " and " Canada and the Circumpolar World Meeting the Challenges of Co - operation into the 21 st Century " and has concurred in the findings of these two reports .
in accordance with the provisions of Standing Order 109 , the committee requests that the government provide a comprehensive response to these reports .
Mr. Speaker , this may seem rather unusual .
it is a rare procedure that reports presented in the last House after an election are re - presented .
our committee is of the view that these reports are extremely important and therefore want to re - present them to the House so we can get the government ' s response .
library OF PARLIAMENT
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi ( Bramalea - Gore - Malton , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the first report of the Standing Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament .
procedure AND HOUSE AFFAIRS
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present the seventh report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs regarding the associate membership of some committees .
if the House gives its consent , I intend to move concurrence in the seventh report later this day .
procedure AND HOUSE AFFAIRS
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present the eighth report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs regarding its order of reference from the House of Commons of Thursday , October 23 , 1997 , in relation to supplementary estimates A for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 1998 , in regard to Vote 5 a under Parliament ( House of Commons ) .
the committee reports the same .
aboriginal AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the first report of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development .
the committee has considered Bill C - 8 , the Canada - Yukon Oil and Gas Accord Implementation Act , and reports it back to the House without amendment .

privacy ACT
Mr. Speaker , the purpose of this bill is to vest the privacy commissioner with the power to determine whether personal information should be disclosed by a government institution under subsection 2 ( 1 ) of the Privacy Act .
the power is currently exercised by the head of such an institution , namely a cabinet minister .
this bill will ensure that ministers cannot hide behind the Privacy Act for political reasons .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

criminal CODE
i believe that section 43 contravenes the charter of rights and freedoms and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child .
we hear a lot about societal violence and abuse of children .
this section of the Criminal Code legally sanctions corporal punishment which leads to the physical and emotional injury of children .
it is high time that this section of the Criminal Code was repealed to make it clear that this ancient law no longer has a place in a society that upholds and values the rights of children .

i am happy to support that .
joyriding
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :

Mr. Eug 猫 ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the pleasure to present three petitions .
in the first , the petitioners are asking that the phrase sexual orientation not be included in the Canadian Human Rights Act .

Mr. Eug 猫 ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my second petition urges the federal government to join with provincial governments to make the national highway system upgrading possible .

Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present a petition which has been signed by almost 80 % of the residents eligible to vote in the town of Hudson .
they urge parliament to make clear and present a commitment to honour and protect the Canadian territorial status of the town of Hudson pursuant to the expressed will of its residents as herein presented and demonstrated by the local results of any future provincial referendum on separation .
i would like to pay tribute to Mrs. Thompson , who is the initiator of this petition .
she is in the gallery and has worked very hard and diligently to keep our country united .
for that I salute her .
nuclear WEAPONS
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to present a petition on behalf of concerned constituents of Brandon - Souris , more particularly the town of Killarney , Manitoba .
it has to do with the abolition of nuclear weapons .
it requests parliament support the immediate initiation and conclusion by the year 2000 of an international convention that will set out a binding timetable for the abolition of all nuclear weapons .
as it seems the House has done such a wonderful job on land mines , I think it is now time to go up one more stage and accept the petition on the abolition of nuclear weapons .
criminal CODE
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is with great pleasure that I present two petitions on behalf of my constituents .
in the first the petitioners are concerned that the possible removal of section 43 of the Criminal Code would strengthen the role of bureaucracy .
they petition to affirm the duty and responsibility of parents to raise their children according to their own conscience and beliefs .
they want to protect section 43 of the Criminal Code .
rights OF CHILDREN
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the second petition is with regard to the United Nations convention on the rights of the child and the fact that not all provinces support that move on the part of the government .
they petition support for Motion No. 300 which would recognize the fundamental rights of individuals to pursue family life free from undue interference from the state and furthermore recommend the fundamental right and responsibility of parents to direct the upbringing of their children .
it is with great honour that I present these two petitions .
criminal CODE
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have a petition to present today calling on the government to end the legal approval of corporal punishment of children by repealing section 43 of the Criminal Code of Canada .
rights OF FAMILY
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have three petitions to present today .
the first ones has to do with the family .
the petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the House that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its value to our society .
they also point out that the Income Tax Act does not take into account the real costs of raising children .
the petitioners therefore pray and call upon parliament to pursue initiatives to assist families who choose to provide care in the home to their preschool children .
labelling OF ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the second petition has to do with the issue of alcohol misuse .
the petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the House that the consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems , particularly fetal alcohol syndrome and other alcohol related birth defects which are 100 % preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy .
the petitioners therefore pray and call upon parliament to mandate the labelling of alcoholic products to warn expectant mothers and others of the risk associated with alcohol consumption .
public SAFETY OFFICERS
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the final petition has to do with our everyday heroes , police officers and firefighters .
the petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the House that police officers and firefighters are required to place their lives at risk on a daily basis .
the employment benefits they receive often provide insufficient compensation to the families of public safety officers killed in the line of duty .
they also point out that the public mourns those losses .
therefore the petitioners pray and call upon parliament to establish a public safety officers compensation fund for the benefit of families of police officers , firefighters and other public safety officers killed in the line of duty .
criminal CODE
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to present a petition , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , containing well over 12,000 signatures .
all the petitioners are from the Kamloops constituency .
thousands of people from my constituency are saying that this does not seem right at all and should be repealed .
i have another petition that has to do with section 43 of the Criminal Code of Canada .
the petitioners feel that it is not right for parents to inflict physical pain on children at young ages .
when they are determining their values and the basic morals of society it is not right for parents to inflict pain on children for disciplinary purposes and goes against the spirit of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
they are asking for a repeal of section 43 .
national HIGHWAY SYSTEM
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have a whole list of truckers from the Kamloops constituency .
they call upon parliament to develop a national highway system upgrading program , using infrastructure money to make sure Canada ' s highway system is in first rate condition from coast to coast to coast .
taxation
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , another set of petitioners are concerned about the unfair tax system in Canada presently .
they point out that it is unjust , unfair , biased and a disaster , to put it mildly .
they consider it to be so haywire that it needs a complete overhaul .
they call for a cost benefit analysis for every tax exemption to ensure , whatever the cost is , that the people of Canada , in particular the taxpayers of Canada , are getting the best bang for their dollar .
national HIGHWAY SYSTEM
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is a request by petitioners to dedicate the federal excise tax on gasoline , or at least a part of it , to rehabilitate Canada ' s crumbling highway system , again a dedicated tax for highway construction .
nuclear WEAPONS
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have a petition from concerned Manitobans with regard to the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons .
canada and all state parties to the 1968 United Nations treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons reaffirmed their commitment in May 1995 to undertake to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date .
the petitioners simply would like the House and the government to enter into a binding timetable for the abolition of all nuclear weapons .

that the Committee be empowered to appoint , from among its members , such sub - committees as may be deemed advisable , and to delegate to such sub - committees , all or any of its power , except the power to report to the Senate and House of Commons ;
that the Committee be empowered to adjourn from place to place within and outside Canada ;
that the Committee be empowered to authorize television and radio broadcasting of any or all of its proceedings ;
that the Committee present its final report no later than November 30 , 1998 ; and
that a Message be sent to the Senate to acquaint that House accordingly .
before I do , since this is my first opportunity to rise in the House while you have been in the chair , Mr. Speaker , I want to say what a great pleasure it is .
on behalf of my constituents in Edmonton West I want to say what a great pleasure and honour it was for all of us when you were appointed Assistant Deputy Speaker in the House .
i look forward to working with you in the months and years ahead .
the motion calls for a special committee to examine and analyse issues relating to custody and access arrangements after separation and divorce and , in particular , to assess the need for a more child centred approach to family law policies and practices that would emphasize joint parental responsibilities and child focused parenting arrangements based on children ' s needs and best interests .
i know there is a great deal of interest and concern about these very important issues .
when a marriage breaks down , arrangements have to be made for the care , upbringing and maintenance of the children .
some parents , many parents , are able to work together to decide what these arrangements should be .
they are able to focus on the interests of their children and can agree on where the children will live and how decisions will be made about the children ' s schooling , religious upbringing , medical care and participation in extracurricular activities .
for other parents , however , this is a difficult task .
divorce is a complex and emotional time in people ' s lives .
as parents , most will want to try to do what is best for the children , but they may be confused , hurt or angry .
they may be unable to agree about what arrangements are best for their children .
they may vie for the loyalty of their children .
there can also be genuinely complex issues that need to be resolved .
there are also concerns that parents who cannot agree about parenting issues involving their children must often resort to an adversarial system that tends to promote the anger and hurt associated with separation and divorce .
many believe that the very terminology of custody and access in family law legislation reflects a winner and loser approach that encourages the parties to compete with each other for the status of real or best parent .
too often the legal process contributes to the conflict between the parents and results in outcomes that do not resolve matters but in fact further promotes ongoing difficulties and pain .
recent experience with child support reforms suggests that these issues to be dealt with by the committee will promote vigorous debate , dare I say at times probably contentious debate .
there are many different views about what problems should be emphasized and about what reforms are required .
the difficult and controversial nature of the issue should not dissuade us from beginning the process of reform .
the many transitions and reorganizations that accompany family breakdown greatly affect the children involved .
while the long term effects of divorce should not be exaggerated by any of us , there is no doubt that divorce is a painful experience for children .
there is a real need to look at custody and access issues and attempt to reform the family law system to minimize the negative impacts of divorce on children .
the motion asks that the committee specifically look at the need for a more child centred approach to family law policies and practices .
i believe this is very important .
the goal must be to identify the legal rules , principles and processes that will emphasize what is best for the children .
this can be done if the committee is steadfast in focusing on children .
i believe there is an obligation to examine this issue through the lens of the needs and rights of children .
all concerned Canadians , ourselves included , must reject the temptation to cast this debate as one between the interests of mothers versus fathers .
if we are to move forward in dealing with the challenge of parenting after divorce , both individually and in our public policy , we must be vigilant in making the needs and rights of children our primary source of inspiration .
to help in this task the committee can review the professional literature about the developmental needs of children and examine models being used in other jurisdictions that have attempted to alleviate the negative impact of divorce on children .
the committee can also meet with and listen to the many individuals and groups that care about the quality of life for our children .
i know there is a great deal of interest , concern and insight that Canadians will bring to these issues .
i urge all members of the House to support the motion .
it is time to find ways to help parents better resolve their differences and focus on what is in the best interests of their children .
unfortunately , because of prior engagements , I have to leave the House in a few minutes .
but I want everyone to know that I am going to follow and review with interest the speeches that follow in this debate because I do believe this is an opportunity for all of us , in the Senate and the House of Commons , all parties , to work together to do something that is not only right but very important to ensure a better quality of life for all our children and families as we approach the millennium .
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i am also pleased that the Minister of Justice is still with us .
there is another matter before that department , Bill C - 16 .
there have been deliberations among all the parties about this subject matter .
i believe I have the consent of the House for the following motion :
that , notwithstanding any standing order , if Bill C - 16 has been reported from committee no later than November 6 , 1997 , the House may consider the said bill at the report stage and at the third reading stage on November 7 , 1997 .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the House has heard the terms of the motion .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
( motion agreed to )
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise to speak to the motion to establish a joint committee of the House of Commons and the Senate .
last February a rather historic and public discussion ensued across the country on Bill C - 41 , an act to amend the Divorce Act .
by the time the bill got to the Senate , alarm bells began to be heard in the community .
the groundswell was enormous and powerful .
public support for the Senate ' s actions to slow down and review Bill C - 41 was profound and unprecedented .
public concern for fairness in the divorce law was strongly expressed .
we only have the motion today because the government was forced into a situation in order to get Bill C - 41 passed in the last Parliament .
the government , in rushing the bill to passage , rushed the committee ' s work .
in fact , public support for the position taken by the Senate surprised the government .
the dominant public wish and the one which most frequently and repeatedly was articulated was the wish that we in Parliament would return balance , fairness and equilibrium to the Divorce Act , to the practice of family law , to the courts and to the administration of justice .
i quote one letter written by Toronto lawyer Bruce Haines , Queen ' s counsel .
he wrote in part :
during that same period I have watched spousal social expectations change in that husbands have embraced a full participation in all aspects of family functions , particularly in the nurturing and raising of their children .
changes to the divorce law have rarely kept pace with changing attitudes and , despite the gender neutral language of the Divorce Act , its actual implementation in the areas of child custody and child support has continued to be marked by an entrenched systemic gender bias that " mother knows best and father pays best '' .
the administration of justice does not treat spouses equally when it comes to assigning child custody .
by and large , custody is almost always assigned to mothers and the most fathers can hope for is a generous access order .
where fathers interfere with custody orders they will ordinarily bear the full weight of the law while mothers who flaunt access orders will , by and large , receive judicial admonitions with usually little other consequence .
section 16 ( 10 ) of the Divorce Act requires courts to take into consideration the willingness of the person for whom custody is sought to facilitate contact of the child with each spouse .
practising family lawyers know that this section is almost never invoked .
- you have an opportunity to correct at least some of the mischief inherent in this deeply flawed legislation .
i urge - to reject Bill C - 41 in its present form and to approach all of the issues on a remedial basis .
in considering custody and child support , there is a need to restore greater balance between the rights of mothers and fathers .
i have not ventured into other areas of family law where the similarly entrenched systemic gender biases seems to exist .
this was one of the many letters of the view that divorce legislation must be balanced and fair .
that was widely held across the country by most Canadians , men and women .
senators amended Bill C - 41 and passed the amended bill on February 13 , 1997 .
the House of Commons concurred with the amendments the next day .
as part of the passage of Bill C - 41 , the government , in response to the concerns of senators and non - custodial parents , committed itself to studying the issues of custody and access .
the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada said :
- this government will take the steps necessary to introduce a motion in this session to establish a joint Senate - House of Commons committee to study issues related to custody and access under the Divorce Act .
the government is offering this commitment in response to concerns raised by some senators on behalf of non - custodial parents , who believe that this issue should be re - examined .
family issues are fundamental to our society .
in the last election our party made a commitment to make families a priority .
we said among other things that we made a commitment to the country to make families a priority and ensure that government policies and regulations are family friendly .
we would help provinces and local governments ensure that deadbeat parents live up to their responsibility to support their children when families break down .
we would ensure that agreements concerning access to children are respected an enforced .
a zero tolerance policy would be enacted on family violence and we would crack down on child prostitution and child pornography .
we also said that we would make families a priority .
i quote from our literature :
while the federal government has been catering to special interest groups , the voice of Canadian families in the policy debate has grown weaker and weaker .
this has resulted in social and economic policies that undermine the security of Canadian families , causing unnecessary levels of stress , burnout , and financial hardship .
family time is not a luxury .
it is absolutely essential if we are to preserve health and happiness in our homes .
it ' s time to make families a priority again .
for too long these issues of custody and access have been begging Parliamentary committee study .
witnesses related to the numerous and extensive problems in the areas of custody and access and the problems facing non - custodial parents .
they also described many problems including parental alienation syndrome , commonly known as PAS , and false sexual abuse allegations in divorce and custody disputes .
the new payment guidelines of Bill C - 41 sound good , but I have a letter from one parent who claims that the change has brought a loss to the children , a loss of relationship .
he says in part :
as you may have gathered I am one of the so called non - custodial parents .
i have paid my share of my children ' s expenses through child support payments for the past eleven years .
now the government has decided that I am really just a wallet for my kids - It seems to me that pressures have swung the pendulum all the way to the other side .
i am now having to pay so much to my ex and Revenue Canada that I will no longer be able to visit with my children or have them come to stay with me .
i think that when the law was enacted too much consideration was given to the custodial parents - and not enough to the non - custodial parents .
again I tell you that this law has now made it so that this will be the last summer that I will be spending with my children and I don ' t anticipate visiting as often as I live 600 kilometres away .
i just cannot afford the luxury and that is what the new law has made it .
i hope you understand what is happening and can do something about the law to make it fair .
parental alienation syndrome is an effort by one parent , the custodial parent , to eliminate access between the children of divorce and their non - custodial parent .
elimination of access is often a significant indicator in an effort to alienate the non - custodial parent , eliminating access on a permanent basis .
Dr. Richard Gardner coined the term parental alienation syndrome to describe the process whereby one parent initiates the systematic vilification of the other parent by manipulation of the child with the intent of alienating the child from the other parent .
the manipulation of time becomes the prime weapon in the hands of the alienator .
parent alienation syndrome occurs when one parent is engaged in an attempt not merely to destroy the other parent and the other parent ' s relationship with the child but also to cause the child to join in the process .
the child enters the dynamic becoming a weapon , a spokesperson , a co - combatant in the process .
another problem is the use of false sexual abuse allegations in divorce and custody proceedings .
of particular note is that these peculiar false allegations arise in the context of divorce and custody disputes .
false allegations , as in the case Plesh v. Plesh , the trial judge , Mr. Justice Carr of the Manitoba Court of Queen ' s Bench in his 1992 judgment stated about an applicant " I conclude she never believed that their son had been abused , not when she reported the abuse and not now '' .
these are only some of the many problems in the operation and application of the law with respect to custody and access .
in the last Parliament , former member of Parliament Daphne Jennings championed a grandparents ' right private member ' s bill to extend better legal standing for grandparents in court contested custody cases .
on the issue of access , the 1995 Supreme Court of Canada decision in Gordon v. Goertz was significant .
the issues for adjudication were custody access and contact between the child and non - custodial parent .
in her reasons for judgment Madam Justice Beverley McLachlin wrote " Important as contact with the non - custodial parent may be , it should be noted that not all experts agree on the weight to be given to such contact in assessing the best interests of children '' .
that statement and judgment caused a lot of anxiety and anguish to non - custodial parents across this land and caused many to ask Parliament to study the issues of custody and access .
as Mr. Haines pointed out earlier in the letter that I quoted " Marriage and society in general have moved toward joint parenting and joint responsibility for children .
as a former divorce mediator , I have special awareness of these kinds of problems .
however , in 1991 the justice minister , then professor of law , wrote a discussion paper for the Alberta Advisory Council on Women ' s Issues entitled " Women and the Process of Constitutional Reform '' .
such devolution , she believes , would result in joint custody after a divorce .
she apparently was not in support of it .
she stated " If through constitutional reform , divorce became a matter of exclusive provincial jurisdiction , provinces could legislate comprehensively in the area of the family .
some provincial legislatures may choose to impose a presumption of joint custody and require mandatory mediation in the resolution of family disputes '' .
the minister also said " An increasing number of commentators now suggest that joint custody may simply perpetuate the influence and domination of men over the lives of women '' .
what an incredible statement .
the terms have been read out by the Speaker .
in general the courts typically deal somewhat acceptably with money , but they deal very poorly and handle with great difficulty custody , access and guardianship .
the federal Divorce Act and similar provincial family court acts leave a messy jurisdictional problem within the area of family law .
therefore , the renewed parliamentary attention to outstanding issues on family law is welcome .
reformers recognize the fundamental importance of family to society and Reformers agree that changes to family law need to be addressed to ensure the rules are more family friendly .
we will certainly emphasize the need for such an issue to be raised in Parliament in order to raise the profile of the family and family issues as it clearly is a priority topic in the community .
consequently we will fully participate and will work to ensure reasonable cost in the conduct of the committee while we also ensure we have balanced deliberations .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is a rather odd motion we have before us today .
when I first looked at it , I was not all that surprised at the government ' s approach , because as justice critic I have had to look at a number of bills and am becoming increasingly aware that the federal government is , under the guise of the preponderance it claims to have under the Constitution , under the guise of peace , order and good government , or under the guise of criminal law , encroaching more and more on areas under provincial jurisdiction .
this week we had another striking example , Bill C - 14 on drinking water .
is there any area more provincial than water ?
things are getting more and more complicated with the government over there .
a while ago , we found it somewhat amusing to watch the matter of which jurisdiction the St. Lawrence River came under .
you will see that there is a parallel in this .
so there you are , what a fine great country Canada is .
finally , we address a subject similar to this motion .
when a couple separates in Canada - this is referred to directly in the motion - this is provincial legislation .
but when they divorce , this is federal legislation .
and if that were not sufficiently complex , the federal government has decided in its wisdom as a centralizer , of course , to table a motion and mandate some of the dear senators .
i hope they will find enough of them awake to fill the positions .
there will be 7 senators and 16 MPs with the two co - chairs , making up a nice little committee to examine child custody , visiting rights , parenting and so on .
this motion is worded so broadly that it encompasses large areas directly under provincial jurisdiction .
i will give you a few examples of this .
in Quebec , the mechanisms for implementing custody and visiting rights when there is a separation come under the Civil Code .
the federal government has nothing to do with it .
parenting of children comes under parental authority , a jurisdiction of the Quebec National Assembly .
the federal government has nothing to do with this .
as regards the school system , which is under provincial jurisdiction , the federal government has no business intervening .
then there is the federal government ' s unwarranted intrusion in the lives of individuals .
the motion talks about " practices that would emphasize joint parental responsibilities and child - focused parenting arrangements based on children ' s needs and best interests '' .
what is the federal government doing in this area ?
tell me .
it is provocation , pure and simple .
it has no business in this area of jurisdiction .
i wondered how the people opposite , who are supposed to be intelligent , can be guilty of such provocation ?
an hon. member :
they are supposed to be .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
yes , they are supposed to be , as one of my colleagues said .
but , perhaps we should look at the background to this motion .
we have to go back to the 35 th Parliament , where little deals were made here in the House , not with the duly elected members sitting here , but with the two or three senators who were not sleeping in the other place .
deals were made with the federal government and they were told " Let Bill C - 41 on child support pass , and we will find you a little something to do .
we will arrange it so you can look at the issues of custody and access after divorce '' .
that was the deal made at the time to get C - 41 through .
what is this motion about ?
it concerns both divorce and separation .
it is much broader .
however , the many members opposite who support the minister ' s motion should open their ears to what a member of the Bloc Quebecois has to say on the matter rather than watching what is happening above .
our comments are important , and perhaps if they paid a little more attention to Quebec ' s historical demands , we would not be here discussing the distribution of powers or anything else .
the problem between Canada and Quebec would have been settled 35 years ago .
that having been said , I understand that the topic , which has to do with child custody from a financial or parenting point of view after separation , is a serious one .
we are not saying that it is not serious or important .
on the contrary , it is very much so , but it is up to the provinces , not the federal government , to legislate in this area .
as far as Quebec is concerned , I am well placed to address this issue , first because I am an MP from Quebec , and second because I am a lawyer .
i argued matrimonial cases before I was elected to office .
since that time , things have even improved in Quebec with the recent reforms introduced by the PQ government , some of which took effect on May 1 , 1997 , and others of which took effect recently on September 1 , 1997 .
we in Quebec have a model for setting support payments that reflects the importance Quebec places on its children .
this model takes into account the income of both parents and the length of custody .
in addition , a form and a guide for determining amounts are made available to parents , mediators , counsel and judges .
the model is so good that the federal government has agreed to apply it in cases of divorce , while we naturally applied it in cases of separation , since separation comes under provincial jurisdiction .
and all this has been in effect since May 1 , 1997 .
they are talking about family mediation as though it were the discovery of the century .
there is therefore a market , and this service is used in Quebec .
the legislation provides for a process of registering decisions with a special clerk in order to speed matters up , because there is also an important issue at stake : there is no stalling around when it comes to children ' s rights , parents ' visiting rights , salary , family income ; decisions must be taken quickly .
a follow - up committee will submit a report on the process to the Minister of Justice , in the fall of 1998 . Serious work is being done ; measures are being applied and a follow - up will take place .
as you can see , whether it is child support setting , mediation , children ' s rights , the right to attend school , alimony , etc. , Quebec has already adopted major legislation on all these issues .
today , if the federal government really wanted to show its good will in this regard , it could withdraw without any problem from family law and even divorce matters .
we can dream , but we know the federal government will not do it .
in the last 30 years , it has been increasingly interfering in areas under provincial jurisdiction , including those of Quebec .
the motion shows that , when it comes to parenting , the federal government does not hesitate to get involved in this area , which comes under provincial jurisdiction .
as I said earlier about the federal government interfering in people ' s lives , I think that too is not its jurisdiction .
all this to say that my initial reaction to this motion was to say " We in the Bloc Quebecois must not take any part in this charade .
we in the Bloc Quebecois must not be a party to this centralizing approach , an approach that does not in any way reflect Quebec ' s demands '' .
they wanted us to be there to voice our opposition to this extremely centralizing bill .
and that is what we shall do .
the hon. member for Longueuil , whose professionalism is well known , will take part in this committee to represent Quebec ' s point of view .
she will also make the point that , in Quebec , we are at the forefront in several areas , and family issues in particular .
if at all possible , because I am a perpetual optimist , we in the Bloc Quebecois will try to bring the government and those senators who are not asleep round to our opinion .
we will try to convince them that they should not interfere in this area but rather give it over to each province ' s legislative assembly .
but if we are unable to change their minds on a matter as important as this one , I am confident that the hon. member for Longueuil will let our caucus know and , if the government does not yield to the Bloc ' s arguments , in her wisdom , she will table a minority report .
that having been said , you will understand that , yes , we will take part in the work of this committee if it is struck .
we will pay close attention and very strongly insist that Quebec ' s demands in this area of jurisdiction be met .
i have been hearing all sorts of comments coming from the other side since I rose to take part in this debate .
there is one thing I would like to say : if it is true that the members opposite are so committed to the interests of children , why then have they not yet endorsed the Quebec - France agreement on child support ?
this agreement directly concerns the children of Quebec , and yet the government opposite is wrangling over procedures , scrutinizing every comma and preventing thousands of Quebec families from receiving child support from overseas .
if the government is truly committed to the interests of children , it should endorse the agreement that has been signed between Quebec and France , and maybe then we will be able to believe them when they say they are committed to families , to sound management in this area of responsibility that does not belong to them .
we will be showing openness by attending the hearings to be held by this committee , although we find it useless and a waste of time , and I hope that the government opposite will at least be smart enough to listen to our demands and to take them into account in any future legislation .
Mr. Claude Drouin ( Beauce , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I was listening to my colleague opposite speaking about his experiences and his background in the legal profession .
i was once a policy advisor at the provincial level and I can tell you that I have seen more than one woman having difficulties with provincial laws .
i don ' t think there is much to be proud of in this respect .
either he is out of touch , or he was being selective in his choice of cases .
he often makes reference to the senators .
i can introduce him to some of them and he will realize that they are people with a lot of experience and knowledge and that , even if a few were caught with their eyes closed , that does not mean they are all sleeping .
it is important that he realize this .
i have a question for the hon. member .
if a couple separates and one of the partners moves to another province , would national standards not make it easier to settle matters ?
that was my comment and my question .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would ever so politely say to the hon. member that he ought to have remained a political adviser , because as a politician , at least as an MP representing a Quebec riding - unless I am mistaken - he ought to know that the remarks he has made are totally inaccurate , totally coloured by very negative stereotypes on Quebeckers , who have passed family legislation that is superior to what there is in many other provinces .
there are many MPs who speak in this House but are rarely seen in committee .
i invite the hon. member to the justice committee , among others , where subjects like this will be discussed .
i hope that the hon. member will , at the very least , be appointed to the joint committee which will examine this matter and which will hear qualified witnesses in this area , from Quebec and elsewhere .
very often , people from outside Quebec are the ones who quote Quebec legislation .
i often heard , during the 35 th Parliament , people from Vancouver , from Alberta , from the maritimes , quoting legislation , citing Quebec ' s various social measures as examples .
i think that the hon. member across the way is completely unaware of this .
for that reason , I repeat that he might have been better off remaining a politicial adviser .
i can understand that perhaps giving opinions like that to the MP he worked for before may be what put an end to his career as a political adviser .
as for the rest , I do not understand the hon. member ' s question on how divorces in Ontario , in Quebec , in some other province , can be handled if it is not the same law that applies .
what happens with separations ?
the same law does not apply , it depends on whether it is in Quebec , Ontario , British Columbia or the maritimes .
but do some people end up worse off as a result ?
No. Because the provinces have passed legislation which reflects what they are .
we in Quebec do things differently than they can in Ontario , for example , or in western Canada .
the men of the 1990 s in Quebec are not the same as those of the 1970 s .
our experience in Quebec is not necessarily the same as that of Ontario or western Canada .
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is with pleasure that I rise to speak to the issue before the House today .
it is one that I have some particular interest in .
hon. members indicated in their earlier comments the experience they have had .
my own experience in this area goes back as a legal aid lawyer for some 12 years , dealing with people in society who do not perhaps have the financial ability in many cases to afford social workers or counsellors and who find themselves locked into litigation of the courts and litigating over the custody of and access to their children .
it is no argument that family law lawyers who deal with these problems deal with one of the most difficult and fractious areas of law in the country .
it is no argument that social workers who deal in this area of the law find themselves confronted on a daily basis with very difficult decisions .
it is no exaggeration to say law enforcement agencies that are forced in some cases to enforce court orders dealing with custody and access find themselves in very difficult situations .
i know because I have seen the children put in police cars when one parent demands to exercise access .
i have also seen children tortured and torn between two parents saying on one hand " I want to be with this parent " to please the custodial parent and on the other hand " I want to be with this parent " to please the access parent .
it is clear in the area of divorce and family law that we are not dealing in a very sensible and certainly not in a very effective way with the needs of the children who find themselves caught in that arrangement .
at the end of the day there has to be a better way to deal with family breakup .
i am pleased to support the structuring of this committee .
i welcome its views .
it can perform a very real service for all the people I have mentioned who work in family law services and in the family courts by helping us come to grips with what should not be an adversarial process but a conciliation process dealing with children .
before I was a member of Parliament , as a lawyer and a private citizen I submitted a report to the then minister of justice in the last parliament which sought to reform the Divorce Act .
i dealt with the very issues this committee will be examining , whether or not there ought to be a presumption of joint custody , whether or not there ought to be other presumptions in terms of determining which parent has custody .
when we look at the Divorce Act as it currently stands , unfortunately in many ways it encourages litigation and takes us away from a reconciliation process or a mediation process .
the framers of the act did not intend this but once we take the family and put it before the courts in a litigious manner , in an adversarial manner , then right off the bat we find ourselves acting in ways that might be in the best interests of clients or might be in the spirit of the legislation , but are not in the spirit of the family .
just as an example , section 16 of the Divorce Act allows for an interim order for custody .
as every family lawyer knows , the courts have developed over the years many tests to determine which parent ought to be the custodial parent .
i can go back to the parents patria jurisdiction of the court , the tender years doctrine , which was used by the courts for many years to determine in most cases that the mother ought to be the custodial parent of children who were of tender years .
the courts then revised that and dealt with the status quo doctrine .
of course the overriding principle is always the best interests of the child but it is the difficulty in determining that which the courts have to grapple with .
it is with that difficulty that these tests have been developed .
one of the predominant tests is of course the status quo doctrine , which is that the parent who has custody of the children and provides a good environment for them immediately after the separation ought to be the parent who has custody .
it is not good for the children to have constant upheaval .
as sensible as that test may be , when we put it into the litigation context , it encourages family law lawyers to make an application for interim custody right off the bat .
they know that in many cases the first one at the bar takes all .
when we look at it in that adversarial context , that is the kind of thing which the act encourages .
for families that have sufficient means , and the justice minister alluded to some families who are able in many situations to work out their own custody and access arrangements , many parents can .
many poor parents can because they put the needs of the children first and allow themselves to work within that framework .
however there may be more success among wealthier people because of course they can avail themselves of mediation services which in many provinces are currently privately run and run for profit .
obviously there is a need to take this out of the litigation process and move it into a more conciliatory process .
as I have indicated , that is one section of the Divorce Act which encourages litigation .
while there is a presumption of joint custody or access , the act itself looks at other factors .
it says that the court ought not to look at the past conduct of a parent in determining which parent ought to have custody or access .
yet we know that many judges in the litigation process are influenced by many things .
while the court says we ought not to look at past conduct unless it is in relation to the children , if we are in a win or lose situation , it is not unusual for litigation lawyers in a family law practice to bring up events from the past which have no impact on raising the children but which may appeal to a particular judge ' s sense of what is morally correct and what is not .
the act itself in its current form may encourage litigation which is not always in the best interests of the child and certainly does not go the distance in helping to determine a better mode of dealing with the children who are the subject of divorce proceedings .
the tests that I have indicated filter down into provincial legislation .
my hon. colleague in the Bloc talked about the jurisdictional problems .
those jurisdictional problems are there .
there is no question that upon separation , the family finds itself in family court .
upon divorce , they find themselves in the federal or supreme courts .
therefore what has been determined by a lower court is not necessarily binding in the federal court .
it is extremely difficult .
so the jurisdictional problem is one I think this committee could look at in a very real way .
it would be remiss if I did not say , coming from a legal aid background , that unless we look at resources in the legal aid system which deals with the vast majority of family law cases in this country , unless we look at ensuring there is a solid legal aid system in place in each of the provinces , all of the rhetoric about the best interests of the children and all of the conclusions this committee can come to will be nothing more than a report placed on a shelf to be dusted off occasionally .
unless we are committed to putting in place mediation services , legal aid services , family court services , then it may well be a waste of time .
i respect the comments made by the hon. member , my colleague from the Reform Party , when he talked about the presumption of joint custody .
i think most parents would agree on that until such time as there is a breakup .
at that time families need someone to discuss with them the interests of their children separate and apart from maintenance payments and support payments in a way that they can understand the joint obligations as well as the joint rights that parents have .
there has been some indication that this committee will look at all of those questions .
it may well lead to guidelines in the Divorce Act that can then be applied to provincial acts .
i look forward to hearing and examining the situation in Quebec that has been referred to by my hon. colleague .
i would support the committee and the creation of the committee .
it can only benefit the children and the families of this country as they struggle in what is obviously a difficult situation .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre , Labour ; the hon. member for L 茅 vis , Railway Transportation ; the hon. member for Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , Tip Employees .
the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons on a point of order .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I believe you will find consent for the following order :
that at the conclusion of today ' s debate on government business No. 7 , the Speaker shall put all questions necessary to dispose of the said government order , a recorded division shall be deemed requested and deferred until the expiry of government orders , Tuesday , November 18 , 1997 .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
does the hon. parliamentary secretary have unanimous consent to move this motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the House has heard the terms of the motion .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
( motion agreed to )
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
September 2 , 1997
in Montreal this morning , Quebec ' s Minister of Justice and Attorney General , Serge M 茅 nard , unveiled the new family mediation program .
as of yesterday , there is a new way to approach separation or divorce in Quebec and it is free .
bill 65 , an act adding family premediation to the Code of Civil Procedure and amending other provisions in this Code , which was passed by the National Assembly on June 13 , came into effect on September 1 .
for the first time in Quebec , it will now be possible for couples with children to reach agreement on custody , visiting rights , outings , support payments and even the division of property , at no cost .
that is pretty clear , as press releases go .
i also think it is pretty clear as to the approach taken by the National Assembly .
does he not think the federal government should withdraw entirely from the family law sector and leave this completely up to the provinces ?
Mr. Peter Mancini :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to answer the hon. member ' s question in French , but my French is not good enough .
so I am forced to answer in English .
unfortunately the program is not in place in the way that we would like in the province .
i would see an opportunity at the federal level .
if this kind of program could be enacted as divorce mediation at the federal level , the different provinces might then see the benefit in this kind of a program and follow the federal lead .
i certainly commend the province of Quebec in taking this type of action but I would not at this point indicate that the federal government ought to withdraw completely .
i think it has a role to play , as a leader , in those provinces that might not be as forward thinking as the province of my hon. colleague .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
i would like to know exactly what he means by " role to play , as leader " in the area of child custody , alimony , education in terms of level of studies and access .
i would like him to tell me not in terms of the Constitution we want , but in terms of the Constitution of 1982 .
Mr. Peter Mancini :
Mr. Speaker , perhaps my English is not as good as it could have been in delivering the previous answer .
what is the role I see for the federal government .
i will use as an example my own province .
obviously the parties have the option of separating and dealing with provincial jurisdiction later on , or immediately the option of divorce and dealing with federal jurisdiction .
they could avail themselves of what might be available and provided at the federal level in the supreme courts of the provinces with federal funding .
that would be the leadership role I would see in child custody and access cases .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
Mr. Speaker , I think that the debate we are having this afternoon is a very interesting one .
the hon. member has just said that the federal big brother may be there to protect his province in the event that there is not enough money available to set up family mediation .
he says that there might be financial assistance to set up mediation .
Mr. Peter Mancini :
Mr. Speaker , I would have no objection to the federal government paying the way , in whatever province .
Ms. Diane St - Jacques ( Shefford , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to start by congratulating the government on presenting this motion to set up a joint committee to examine custody and access in response to the concerns expressed by certain senators on behalf of non - custodial parents .
the government must provide direction on this issue , as it did earlier this year on Bill C - 41 , an act to amend the Divorce Act , with respect to child support payments .
in the course of the debate on Bill C - 41 , many parents requested on behalf of non - custodial parents , whose access rights are guaranteed by order , that similar legislation be passed regarding support orders .
they wanted legislation that would provide for more effective and less costly ways to enforce access orders .
the points raised by witnesses at the hearings on Bill C - 41 included questions on the effectiveness of existing mechanisms to enforce access rights , the rights of second and third families , the opportunity for mandatory mediation in the case of divorce , the rights of grandparents or third parties to apply for custody or access , parents ' freedom of movement after the divorce , the right to information and other non - custodial parent rights and the effects of divorce on a child ' s mental health and development .
we must look at the language of divorce in terms of the divorced parents and the children , as Senator Jessiman pointed out during the debate on this motion .
the language of divorce , the terms used , such as " custody " and " access '' , come from criminal law and property law and are not appropriate to designate the relationship between parents .
the parental approach to custody and access has been taken in a number of states , where joint custody is considered the best solution for divorcing couples , and sole custody is accorded only if it is in the child ' s best interest .
some people are opposed to joint custody .
in 1991 , when she was teaching law at the University of Alberta , the Minister of Justice wrote a working paper for the Alberta Advisory Council on Women ' s Issues entitled " Women and the Process of Constitutional Reform '' .
if , through constitutional reform , divorce were to become an exclusively provincial jurisdiction , the provinces could pass comprehensive family law .
some people would opt for the presumption of shared custody and make mediation obligatory in the resolution of family disputes .
increasingly , commentators feel that sole custody serves only to perpetuate the influence and domination of men over the lives of women .
we all know that education and mediation are the best solution in any dispute , and some witnesses have spoken about education with respect to divorce , an approach that has been taken in a number of Canadian and American cities .
parents seeking divorce take courses about the impact on their children of certain behaviours or attitudes they might adopt - such as involving their children in their dispute - and which are the most likely to have harmful psychological effects on the children .
one of the witnesses before the Senate Standing Committee on Social Affairs , Science and Technology , Paul Carrier , a family counsellor with the Royal Ottawa Hospital , said : " Disputes over custody and access affect children ' s self - esteem - In the interest of children , it is preferable for parents to maintain a harmonious relationship .
money is important , but the quality of the relationship is even more important .
many people have grown up in poor environments but are still happy .
money is important , but it is not the only thing .
the quality of the relationship is still more important '' .
in connection with Bill C - 41 , he said : " The bill does not address the question of access properly .
its approach is not in the children ' s best interests .
it could , and should , attach more importance to parent - child relationships .
if the division of resources does not foster more prolonged contacts between parents and children , the legislator will be neglecting one of children ' s basic needs '' .
article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states as follows : " A child shall not be separated from his or her parents against their will , except when this is in the best interests of the child .
a child who is separated from one or both parents has the right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis '' .
article 18 states that " both parents have common responsibilities for the upbringing and development of the child .
states shall render appropriate assistance to parents in the performance of their child - rearing responsibilities '' .
i have raised some of the questions I wish to see the joint committee examine .
this is an important study and one which , I am sure , will generate measures that will make it possible to create a custody and access system to protect the rights of the child as defined in the UN Convention and will also enable children to continue to benefit from the presence of both parents .
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask the hon. member whether she finds it acceptable for the federal government to be striking a special committee to examine questions of agreements on custody , visiting rights and parenting after parental separation or divorce , when separation is known to be a provincial jurisdiction and the federal government has no right to meddle in this area of provincial jurisdiction ?
Ms. Diane St - Jacques :
Mr. Speaker , the member was saying that separation is a provincial matter , but divorce is federal .
i think that the committee will be set up in the best interests of the children .
it should be set up .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I did not quite understand the hon. member ' s approach .
she cited the rights of children and they indeed have the right to visit their parents and to have a relationship with them .
is the hon. member saying that a province such as Quebec could not legislate the rights its children are entitled to ?
is she , in her centralist and federalist way , saying that provinces like Quebec cannot provide for children the rights they are entitled to ?
Ms. Diane St - Jacques :
Mr. Speaker , I am not saying that Quebec is not able to provide the same rights to children .
what I am saying is that these issues could perhaps be raised before the committee .
i think today ' s debate concerns the establishment of a joint committee to try to find ways to improve the situation for children .
that is what I am saying , and we can raise these issues before the committee and perhaps they can be decided there .
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I enjoyed listening to the speech .
in many cases , we have found in the past that there seemed to be a preponderance of decisions that favour giving the children to the mother when that need not necessarily be the most appropriate decision .
i wonder what the member ' s thoughts are on these types of issues .
as we recognize , the need for equality and for the lack of discrimination in this country are extremely important , but it shows up in more than one place .
here is an example where it has shown up and it has been quite detrimental for many fathers who have made representations to me in my constituency office .
they felt that they have been denied access to their children and are looked on as a means of providing cash .
it is one of the serious injustices that we have .
i would like to get the comments of the member as to how she feels about ensuring that the legislation , if it does become legislation , demonstrates a commitment to equality .
Ms. Diane St - Jacques :
Mr. Speaker , I think in my speech - I am not sure the member was here earlier - I mentioned that we preferred the option of joint custody , with both parents having access .
should one of the parents be unable to care for the child , then things would be different .
but our preference goes to joint custody .
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) :
thereafter the mother abducted their two - year - old child and took her to Jordan .
the father who had legal custody could not have access to the child .
he went to Jordan to fight with the government and the legal system there so that he could bring the child back to Canada because his daughter is a Canadian citizen .
i would like to ask the hon. member what she feels about this kind of situation when the children are abducted and they are carried out of the country .
they are not in a position to come back to Canada and the Canadian government has been unable to follow it up .
what would be the hon. member ' s reaction and what would she feel this motion might do to follow up on these kinds of situations ?
Ms. Diane St - Jacques ( Shefford , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am very sad for those to whom this happens , but this is precisely the kind of problems that could be brought to the joint committee so that a solution can be sought .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , either the member misunderstood the question by the Bloc Quebecois member for Drummond or I misunderstood her answer .
i shall be brief .
one thing is clear : the whole area of separation is under provincial jurisdiction .
members on both sides will agree that separation is under provincial jurisdiction .
divorce , however , under the Canadian Constitution , is a federal jurisdiction .
is the hon. member in favour of having a joint committee consider the issues of custody , visitation rights and parenting following separation or divorce ?
that was my question .
Ms. Diane St - Jacques :
Mr. Speaker , my answer is that , if he attends the joint committee , the hon. member will have the opportunity to raise his question there and we can discuss it in then and there .
the specific purpose of this motion is to set up a joint committee and , personally , I am in favour .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have a few short comments to make on this topic .
i am not sure whether they will find it necessary to meet over in some foreign countries .
perhaps in the middle of winter it would be nice to go south and have a government paid trip .
maybe this is what is contemplated .
surely what we should be looking at is the experience , the needs and the aspirations of Canadian parents .
we have many children who are the products of relationships where the parents are not married to each other .
i am not sure the motion will direct the committee to look at the implications of that .
many of those couples stay together for a while .
they produce one , two or more children , fall into disagreement and walk away from each other .
those children are just as much at risk as those who suffer the experience of a divorce .
i do not know if all members have had experience with couples who have gone through this , but my wife and I have .
it is heart wrenching to see the children being jerked around .
my last comment in this extremely short intervention , which I know is unusual for me , is that I think we need to pay attention to equality .
now there is a cry to bring equalization into it so that fathers also have access to their children and the children to their fathers .
that is a noble goal .
my concern is that when it comes to judging these matters it is a false assumption that the courts always evaluate it correctly .
sometimes we land up with built - in prejudices and biases .
i am afraid that perhaps the bias could go the other way so that in these cases family court judges would have a predilection to choosing fathers instead of mothers for equal or greater advantage .
that may not necessarily be the case .
i simply urge that in all studies like this one we truly urge objectivity and a true evaluation .
that would include much more than just highly paid , court appointed counsellors and psychologists , very frankly some of whom I am not convinced are really competent in their job .
once again the children are the ones who suffer .
these are the few comments I wanted to make in the moments available to me .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to ask a question to the Reform Party member , with whom I sat on several occasions , during the 35 th Parliament , on the Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs .
unfortunately , we had rather different views on many matters .
but that was part of the debate , and each one presented his arguments .
as for the motion we have before us , I have a question similar to the one I asked to other members in this House , but I would like to know his opinion as a Reform member .
does he believe that in the interest of greater harmony , of better enforcement of family law , this whole issue of rights relating to custody , support , visits , and other rights concerning separation or divorce , would be better dealt with if it were the province that had complete jurisdiction in this area ?
Mr. Ken Epp :
madam Speaker , I never was on the justice committee .
i think the member is recalling days when he substituted on public works and government services .
perhaps it was the ethics committee that we worked on , the Bill C - 43 committee .
be that as it may , in answer to his question , where should jurisdiction lie ?
is it provincial or is it federal ?
it is one of those areas where there is a crossover , as I understand it .
in general principle the closer to the people we have the jurisdiction , the better democracy is served .
sometimes it is very difficult to get politicians in distant Ottawa to hear the concerns of the people , whereas those who are in our provincial legislatures simply because they are closer geographically will sometimes be able to get the message a little better .
i give guarded support to saying let us have the legislation as close to the people as possible , in general principle in the provinces .
where a federal law currently has jurisdiction it is under the terms of parliament .
perhaps the committee should look at how to devolve the issue to provincial courts , provincial child care agencies and so on , the people who deal with these issues , so that we get the absolute best expression of concern for the children and their welfare .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
madam Speaker , I wish take the opportunity to set a matter straight for the member .
we sat together on the ethics code committee .
we did not succeed in agreeing there more than on the justice committee .
he made a particular comment that I agree with 100 % .
he said that very often we should ask ourselves which jurisdiction could more properly deal with the matter .
he said that we should always give the responsibility to those who are closest to the people .
i do not think there is a matter more appropriate than this one , on that score .
which jurisdiction , the province or the federal government , can more properly apply the law on divorce or separation ?
i believe that the answer is obvious , it is the provinces .
there is already a lot of social legislation to assist families .
i think this is like a puzzle and there is a piece of this puzzle that is missing and without which Quebec and the other provinces cannot have full jurisdiction , and that piece is divorce legislation , which would complete the whole area of family law .
but my question is the following :
is the Reform member familiar with the Quebec example in the area of family law , including separation ?
also , is the Reform Party member familiar with how we have decided to proceed in Quebec since September 1 , 1997 in the area of family mediation , which is offered to everyone free of charge , which accelerates the process for separation and divorce , and which deals with the issues of custody , child support , joint accounts , assets and other things ?
is the member familiar with the Quebec example and does he recognize that it goes well beyond what the federal government can provide by asking a committee to review this issue ?
Mr. Ken Epp :
madam Speaker , I must concede that I am not aware of the full details of the Quebec bills .
i have heard of them and he has alluded to them in the debate today .
i certainly agree with the member that if there is a good system in place in that province it should be allowed to work .
there is absolutely nothing wrong with that idea .
however , when we are talking about the welfare of children it is very important for children to be in a home in which there is a stable relationship between their parents .
it is distressing to me when I look at the demographics across the country that there is a variation among people who enter into long term , permanent , legal relationships with each other in order to make a family and have children .
i simply respond to the member by saying that the issue in Quebec is no less than it is in any of the other provinces with respect to the care of children .
we need to make them our focus .
there is a great need there .
many of our children are growing up in homes where the parents are not permanently committed to each other .
in those situations statistics show that children are at greater risk in terms of their own personal well - being and welfare .
personally I think we ought to emphasize more the stabilization of families .
one book I read recently indicated that one of the greatest stresses in a marriage relationship is financial .
more husbands and wives argue about money than just about anything else .
in this country we are nigh taxed to death .
the government with its high taxation rates is adding to the stresses of families and thereby contributing to family break - up .
if we could only get that part solved and leave more money in the hands of families so they could provide for each other and their children , we would have less stress and a smaller problem in terms of looking after children from broken homes and from broken relationships where there was no marriage .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
pursuant to order made earlier this day , the question on the motion before the House is deemed to have been put and a recorded division deemed deferred until Tuesday , November 18 , 1997 , at the end of the period reserved for Government Orders .
Mr. Yvan Bernier :
madam Speaker , I rose earlier to ask a question and when you announced we were resuming debate I thought a member opposite was going to speak before me .
i wish to inform the Chair that I still had something to say on the previous motion , which is why I rose .
i would like to know if it was my turn to speak on the motion dealing with child custody , or if it was the turn of the hon. member opposite .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i must tell the hon. member I did not see him at that moment .
with the House ' s consent , we can resume the debate .
does the House gives its unanimous consent ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp 茅 - 脦 les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) :
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
you have 20 minutes .
Mr. Yvan Bernier :
madam Speaker , I also thank hon. members for allowing me to address this motion .
sometimes , there are issues in this House about which we care deeply .
the motion , in part , reads as follows :
- to examine and analyze issues relating to custody and access arrangements after separation and divorce , and in particular -
- and in particular , to assess the need for a more child - centred approach to family law policies and practices that would emphasize joint parental responsibilities and child - focused parenting arrangements based on children ' s needs and best interests ;
you will understand that this motion is of great concern to us in the Bloc Quebecois .
the subject of children strikes a chord .
we believe - not only do we believe , but it is a legislative fact - that the education of children is a matter of provincial jurisdiction .
separation is a provincial matter as well .
when the federal government decides to strike a committee to examine a question , I have never seen it - in my short experience at any rate - spend time addressing a subject and then come up empty , saying " Oh no , we are not going to deal with that any longer '' .
why , when writing these lines , this motion , did the minister or ministers concerned not say " That ' s not really our jurisdiction .
we have no business messing about where we don ' t belong .
there are provisions already in place '' .
they say that the purpose of this is to clarify things for people .
i would just like to address the comment by the Reform member who has just said that this issue merits examination because children undergo great upheaval at the time of separation .
yes , I can imagine .
it is precisely to avoid having both a provincial and federal inspector looking into the welfare of the child .
i do not want to see any more battles over who is in charge of what , jurisdictional squabbles between the province and the federal level when parents separate , ending up with the children having two sets of people concerned with their well - being , looking into their case .
it is all the more confusing when the children are already the victims of a problem between their parents , children who are undergoing the emotional shock parental separation or divorce can represent .
the wording of the motion embraces - a fancy word - areas under of provincial jurisdiction just a little too much .
the word " embraces " may be rather inappropriate when used in connection with divorce or separation , but it is important to point out that what this committee wants to examine embraces areas under provincial jurisdiction too much .
child rearing comes under parental authority , and when it involves the education system , under the province .
the strangest part of the motion is the tail end - and I would say that it is scary - as it refers to an approach that will focus on the responsibilities of each parent to assess the children ' s true needs .
this approach focusses on the responsibilities of each parent , on the needs of the children and their best interests at the time agreement is reached on their education .
if education is a provincial matter , what business do they have sticking their noses in this ?
an hon. member :
meddling .
Mr. Yvan Bernier :
yes , meddling .
i thank the hon. member opposite .
sometimes you have to grab their attention .
i think this is inexcusable intrusion by the federal government in family matters .
i recognize that the federal government wants to get involved in a relationship where the family is on its last legs , but this means going into the bedroom after the parties have left it .
it means going into the parents ' bedroom to see if the parents are making the right decision on the education of their children .
i find that outrageous .
for the benefit of members from other regions besides Quebec , I would like to mention certain elements of Quebec legislation .
in the past year , Quebec has passed two laws .
i will identify them and then we will discuss them a bit .
the second concerns family mediation and has been in effect since September 1997 .
what does this mean ?
it means that Quebec looks after parents who are separating or divorcing .
it is already set up .
family mediation is a new program allowing couples with children to agree at no cost on issues such as custody , visiting rights , child support and the division of assets in every judicial district .
the important thing in all this is that people are doing something .
i see some movement across the floor .
i realize it is getting a little late .
that is the purpose of my speech this afternoon .
i want people to know that .
moreover , I do not understand why a committee is being set up to review this issue , when everything is already in black and white .
as I said earlier , I have never seen the federal government review something and then say that it does not make sense , that the government will not to come up with something .
however , I will give other members an opportunity to address this issue and I am prepared to answer questions if there are any .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
pursuant to order made earlier this day , the question on the motion before the House is deemed to have been put and a recorded division deemed demanded and deferred until Tuesday , November 18 , 1997 , at the expiry of the time provided for Government Orders .

drinking WATER MATERIALS SAFETY ACT
Ms. Beth Phinney ( Hamilton Mountain , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , Canada has a remarkable history of collaboration and co - operation among the federal government , ten provinces and two , soon to be three , territories in the north .
i say remarkable because this is a vast country , an impressive land mass of nearly 10 million square kilometres from the tip of St. John ' s , Newfoundland , in the east to the Queen Charlotte Islands off the coast of British Columbia in the west .
this level of agreement and working together is something most countries have come to envy and in some cases study to see how we do it .
the protection of drinking water is one of our proudest co - operative achievements .
this new legislation , Bill C - 14 , the drinking water materials safety act demonstrates our continuing partnership with the provinces and territories and the vigilance with which we guard the health and safety of all Canadians .
according to the Constitution acts of Canada , drinking water quality from the source to the tap falls under the provincial and territorial jurisdictions .
the federal government however is responsible for protecting Canadians from unsafe materials that come into contact with that water along the way , from the raw water intake through the filtration plant and then through the water mains to our faucets .
the new act will help better protect drinking water by guaranteeing the safety of the materials that come into contact with that water while it is moved to the consumers .
again we are doing this with the support of the provincial and territorial health authorities .
canada has one of the largest safest supplies of fresh water in the world .
we want to keep it that way .
but the quality of that water has often been threatened and in the 1990 s it is falling prey to some new hazards .
a rapidly increasing population puts more pressure on the existing water supply and distribution systems .
there are new concerns about the use of pesticides and chemical effluents runoff from spraying farmers ' fields .
the public at large is becoming more and more concerned about its tap water and is rightly demanding guarantees of safety .
municipalities need to replace aging infrastructures and they need health based standards to ensure that new materials they buy are safe .
all of these concerns and more were cited when the provinces and territories put their support behind the drinking water materials safety act currently before this House .
i cannot emphasize too strongly that the distinct federal , provincial and territorial jurisdictions with respect to drinking water quality will continue to be recognized after the introduction of this bill .
in fact this bill affirms both the federal government ' s responsibility to provide guidance and expertise in the area of drinking water quality and the right of the provinces and the territories to define legally enforceable standards within their own areas of authority .
this bill also acknowledges the federal government ' s role in developing water quality research in collaboration with the provinces and territories .
responsibility for the overall quality of water that flows through the system will remain with the provinces .
the federal government with this new bill will guarantee that all the materials that come in contact with our water are certified to national health based standards .
we will be responsible for the regulation of drinking water materials that make up the distribution system along the way .
these fall into three categories : treatment devices , treatment additives and system components .
quite simply , drinking water materials can be anything , including products and substances , that comes in contact with our drinking water from the time it leaves the water supply until it touches our lips .
why do we need to do this ?
because safe drinking water is an essential resource .
because Canadians expect their water to be protected .
and because present federal legislation and existing voluntary compliance on water materials safety are inadequate .
i know that just moments ago I was boasting about our enviable supply of safe drinking water .
indeed we have some of the best drinking water in the world .
this is partly a fortunate circumstance of history and geography .
but the ongoing protection of our fresh water is no accident .
in partnership with the provinces and territories , we have spent years developing the guidelines for Canadian drinking water quality .
since 1968 Canada has published these guidelines for safe drinking water .
they recommend maximum levels of many chemicals , micro - organisms and radioactive substances .
we are pleased to note that the sixth edition of these important and respected guidelines was published last fall .
these guidelines serve as the basis for drinking water quality enforcement in the provinces and territories .
Alberta and Quebec have both enacted water quality regulations based on these guidelines .
other provinces are enforcing them through their own provincial mechanisms .
this partnership has been working extremely well but we must do more .
these guidelines do not have the added weight of being federal law .
the provinces and territories have asked us for that added leverage in protecting drinking water materials right across Canada .
this bill will ensure that drinking water materials are certified to health based standards enforced by law .
they will give Canadians better control over potentially hazardous drinking water materials that could contaminate drinking water .
home water filters are a good example .
there are many of these products available to consumers at every hardware store , department store and shopping mall .
when we buy one of these filters , we have no guarantee that it will do what the maker claims , which is to improve the quality of drinking water .
in fact we know that while many of these products are reliable , a full 50 % would fail a health based test .
this is a growing industry .
there are false health and safety claims being made and consumers do not always have the means to compare one product against another .
this bill will allow direct comparison based on the same standards tests .
these devices are just one area of concern .
there is the sale of chemicals of uncertified quality to water treatment plants and the leaching of contaminants , such as lead and cadmium , from water storage and delivery systems .
this bill will guarantee the quality of these chemicals and the safety of water system components .
i am also proud to say that the drinking water materials safety act will build upon the unique collaborative and co - operative working relationship Canada has enjoyed with the other jurisdictions in this country .
the Assembly of First Nations in partnership with Health Canada and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is currently working on a project to identify solutions to assist First Nations communities in protecting and enhancing the quality of their drinking water .
this project is known as the drinking water safety program for native people .
since the drinking water materials safety act is national legislation which will regulate all drinking water materials on the market in Canada , it would of course affect future purchases of material for use on Indian lands .
ongoing discussions with provincial and territorial members of the subcommittee on drinking water indicate continued support for federal legislation to improve the safety and effectiveness of devices , additives and components .
direct consultation with the provincial departments of health also revealed strong support for this legislation .
when Health Canada crafted this legislation , its officials wanted to make sure they were not adding a layer of red tape to the existing guidelines .
this proposed legislation will not duplicate or replace local and provincial plumbing codes for example .
in fact it will give much needed support to the provinces in their efforts toward compliance and enforcement of these codes .
current Canadian plumbing codes do not contain health based performance standards and the vast majority , a full 70 % , of plumbing materials are not certified as free from harmful contaminants .
this is simply unacceptable .
again provincial drinking water authorities have asked the federal government to act as a clearing house by guaranteeing health based standards through a process of third party certification .
this bill will do that .
it would be far too costly for each province to run its own separate certification program .
if they did , a costly and confusing patchwork of legislation would result .
i also want to assure my colleagues that this bill will not force the provinces and territories to rip out their existing water systems and put in new ones .
what it will do however is ensure that those municipalities who need to build new water distribution systems will buy safe infrastructure materials .
the provinces and territories will also find their home grown products on a level playing field , opening the door to international markets but closing the door to unscrupulous manufacturers and substandard products which right now can easily be dumped into Canada because there is no federal legislation to prevent it .
i think many members of this House and many consumers will be shocked to discover that a country like Canada has not had such a basic piece of legislation in place long before now .
in fact drinking water legislation was first proposed by a Liberal government in 1983 but it is only now that the Liberals are finally in a position to make good on this commitment to protect the health of Canadians .
the public is worried about issues concerning health and the environment , such as the contamination of drinking water .
Canadians will remember this government ' s strong commitment to protect the health of women and children and the need to stop long term toxic pollutants from entering our water .
this legislation will make good on these promises .
as I said earlier , the protection of drinking water quality is a co - operative venture in Canada , one which we can all be proud of .
we have made great strides in making drinking water safer over the past century and we have done so in partnership with our many distinct regions .
i urge my colleagues to seize this opportunity to once again work in conjunction with our provincial and territorial constituencies .
i urge members of the House to give their wholehearted support to this legislation .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
before we resume debate I should inform the House that the House will be moving to Private Members ' Business at 5.30 p.m. The hon. member for Macleod will have two minutes and would then come back when the legislation comes forward again .
on a point of order , the hon. opposition whip .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is there unanimous consent to call it 5.30 p.m. ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
it being 5.30 p.m. , the House will now proceed to the consideration of Private Members ' Business as listed on today ' s Order Paper .
private MEMBERS ' BUSINESS
criminal CODE
they do not have to be a member of the government .
they can find an issue that is of importance not only in their community but to the country and try to convince other members in the House in a non - partisan way that it is a good idea .
at one time joyriding was equated to someone coming along and borrowing uncle Jim ' s car and going to a barn dance .
that was called a joyride .
joyriding is no longer a joy .
it is now very much a serious crime .
it is not a victimless crime .
it is something that causes a lot of dollar damage , a lot of social problems and unfortunately a lot of injuries and deaths .
i brought forward this bill to try to correct this , the Criminal Code amendment , because of the problem of widespread auto theft in Canada .
in the city of Montreal there are 40,000 auto thefts every year .
there is a total of $ 1.6 billion in damage and loss of vehicles in this country due to auto theft and joyriding .
most of the vehicles that are taken out for what used to be called a joyride are indeed taken , damaged and left .
the practice of joyriding is covered under section 335 of the Criminal Code under the title " Offences Resembling Theft '' .
it reads :
everyone who , without the consent of the owner , takes a motor vehicle or vessel with intent to drive , use , navigate or operate it or cause it to be driven , used , navigated or operated is guilty of an offence punished on summary conviction .
the problem is that this section of the law dealing with joyriders is so weak that young offenders do not even worry about it .
young offenders , underage drivers , are the most common abusers of this section of the Criminal Code .
they do not do it for the money .
they do not do it to sell the cars .
they realize that if they get caught there will not be serious consequences .
so they steal cars .
the average joyrider causes $ 4,000 in damage per car .
that is not a joyride .
that is a serious crime and a serious amount of damage to the vehicle of the unfortunate victim of this crime .
this section of the code is unfortunately tailormade for young offenders .
it does not want to saddle the teenager who is out for a thrill , so it just calls it resembling theft .
unfortunately , because of the changing societal problem we have , this misnomer means that teenagers caught stealing cars do not pay a serious penalty for it .
the courts allow some discretion for judges .
if it is your car that got ripped off with an average of $ 4,000 damage done to it , it is a little disturbing when the penalty does not fit the crime .
a $ 100 fine for $ 4,000 average damage is out of proportion and needs to be fixed .
that is why this bill is before us today .
there is only $ 3.5 million a year stolen in bank robberies .
we are justifiably worried about bank robberies and take the necessary steps to make sure we call it a serious crime .
this is a case of $ 1.6 billion in penalties and we shrug our shoulders and say boys will be boys .
i do not think we should continue with that .
i say that because too much damage is done and too many innocent people are injured by so - called joyriding .
a couple of years ago my brother , a logging contractor , was going to work in the morning and found a kid on the road all covered in mud .
he waved him down and asked for help .
he stopped and helped the kid .
he had driven off the road , down into a creek .
his friend , who was in the car , had a broken back .
my brother got on his cell phone and called for an ambulance and the police .
when the police arrived on the scene they said to this young guy " hi , Jim , took another car , eh ? "
they took the other fellow down to the police station .
before my brother could get there to fill out the papers about being a witness to this event , the young man was on his way out of the police station .
he waved at him and said " see you around '' .
he did that every weekend .
it seemed as though there was nothing the police could do .
they caught the guy .
they knew who he was and yet that young guy went away , shrugging his shoulders .
nothing could be done .
the innocent victim , his friend who came along for the joyride , ended up with a permanent lifetime disability .
that is very unfortunate .
in my riding of Fraser Valley people held an auto theft awareness town hall meeting .
an RCMP officer gave a presentation at that meeting .
i was asked to give my point of view with respect to a Criminal Code amendment .
the RCMP officer informed us of things we could do to prevent auto theft .
ICBC was there as well , our local insurance company .
they also went through some of the things we could do .
they told us to always lock our cars and to put an auxiliary lock on the steering wheel .
they suggested an increased use of bike squads , an increased use of auxiliary police , as well as the use of crime stoppers and community patrols , such as block watch and citizen patrols .
they went through all the things we could do to address the crime of auto theft .
in my home town of Chilliwack auto theft went up 90 % last year .
there is a bunch of things we can do to prevent it , but the bottom line is after the patrols are done and the bike watches and other community efforts are made , and the cars are locked up , put in the garage and everything else , the net result is a 90 % increase in auto theft .
i would even argue that it is a bit like the horse thievery of the old days .
it is more than just the $ 4,000 in damages .
the RCMP officer went on to say that it is not a police problem , that it is a community problem .
it is a national problem .
he asked how the police could do their job when they go through all the work involved in arresting and processing the young offender and the courts fine them $ 100 and ask them not to do it again .
this bill would address that problem .
it would give direction to the police and to the courts .
my bill would make this a serious offence under the Criminal Code .
it should be treated as a serious offence .
they could be sent to a group home or to another appropriate facility .
this bill also stresses the fact that at times it is possible to tell parents of young offenders that they too share a responsibility .
the bill particularly addresses the idea that where it can be shown and where the judge is convinced that the negligence of a parent or guardian has contributed to the crime , then the parent or guardian would be obligated to help pay for the damage .
in other words , a young offender might have a curfew already imposed by the court with restrictions on travel or where they could be or whatever the court has imposed .
the parent might say " What can you do with these young people ?
Jimmy steals cars and that is the way she goes '' .
under the bill , if the court were convinced there was negligence it could tell the parent " Your kid has stolen a car .
he was out at one in the morning , but he was told to be in at midnight .
therefore we are going to hold you responsible for some of the damages '' .
i think that could give parents and guardians some second thoughts as to whether they should be negligent in their duties .
i hope people here in the House recognize the seriousness of this problem .
i believe it is a national problem and one that affects not only the criminal justice system , the courts and the police , and the people who have their cars stolen , but it affects the victims of joyriding , people who are passengers , people who may be involved in a hit and run situation or someone who goes along as an innocent person in what they think is a fun trip to a show and it turns into a very serious accident .
it also affects the young people themselves .
i would argue that in dealing with young offenders who are beginning a habit of breaking the law at a very young age , the kinder thing would be for our police , court system and community not to shrug our shoulders and say that is the way it goes , they are just growing up .
as a country and as a Parliament I think we have an obligation to step in and say that it is serious and we are going to step into their lives at a young age , while they can still possibly be saved from the hardened criminal life .
we should get them help , let them know it is a serious problem that we also take seriously .
if we could send that message clearly to young offenders , perhaps we could start the clean - up .
i think of cases in New York where they have now started to prosecute very minor crimes such as graffiti , defacing walls , breaking windows .
they are starting to prosecute the small stuff because they are finding that if they look after the small stuff then people do not progress in their criminal activity to become habitual criminals .
i hope people will take this into account and I hope the minister gets a draft of the bill and of the message I am trying to send today .
i hope the House of Commons will accept the idea that this has been a long time coming and it is now time to deal with it .
i wonder if there would be unanimous consent to make this a votable motion , to send it to committee for consideration at that stage .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member has asked that his bill be made votable .
is there unanimous consent ?
some hon. members :
No.
Mr. John Maloney ( Erie - Lincoln , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member for Fraser Valley has presented several amendments to section 335 of the Criminal Code which he claims will create a tougher and more effective law , one that will have a real deterrent effect on joyriding by young people .
i would like to commend him for his work in this field .
however , these changes will result in a more draconian law .
i would like to outline a few of the changes : a minimum penalty of six months imprisonment ; a minimum fine of $ 1,000 , with a maximum of $ 5,000 ; a provision for damages to be paid by the offender directly to the victim ; a clause which would make the parents of a joyrider , if he or she is a young offender , liable for any fines or damages in certain circumstances .
as responsible parliamentarians we have an obligation to examine any change in the criminal law very carefully to determine whether tougher penalties will be effective and fair .
we have a special responsibility to scrutinize any law that would impose additional imprisonment and fines on young people who come into conflict with the law .
as we know , joyriding is predominantly a young persons ' offence .
in order to answer that question we should examine how the courts have actually used the joyriding section .
in case I am accused of diminishing the importance of this offence , let me state for the record that I do regard joyriding as a very serious offence .
the involvement of a young person in the appropriation of an automobile is always a significant matter .
it is all the more serious because joyriding so often results in personal injury or costly damage to property .
the problem with Bill C - 209 is that its drafters have not paid sufficient attention to the way section 335 is used by prosecutors and the courts in relation to other criminal charges , in particular the offences of theft , criminal negligence and the possession of stolen property .
the hon. member suggests that there are a huge number of joyriding incidents but relatively few convictions .
i will not debate the numbers but I do recommend that he look at the number of convictions for theft and possession of stolen property at the same time as he analyses the joyriding statistics .
he will likely find that joyriding incidents frequently result in more serious charges or charges in addition to joyriding .
several decades ago Parliament wisely decided that joyriding should be a distinct offence separate from the theft of a motor vehicle .
the difference lies in the intention of the person who takes the vehicle .
the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the distinction between theft and joyriding in a 1972 decision , stating that the joyriding offence was created in order to provide a penalty where it may be difficult or impossible to establish the offence of theft .
the difference lies in the intent of the taker .
the courts have said that if the intent is to merely drive a car and then return it the owner , then that is not theft but rather a separate offence .
these decisions provide the key to understanding how joyriding should be dealt with under the criminal law .
if joyriding charges are not laid as often as the hon. member would like , it is because serious joyriding incidents , which result in injury to other persons or damage to the car or to other property , are often prosecuted with a charge of theft or possession of stolen property , perhaps criminal negligence , careless driving or dangerous driving .
an obvious concern arises here .
can someone who steals a car claim that he really intended to return it to the owner and therefore avoid a theft charge ?
the courts have provided us with the answer .
each case must stand on its own facts .
for example , how long did the offenders keep the car ?
how far did he drive it ?
did he make an effort to return it ?
did he drive the car recklessly ?
all the circumstances must be considered .
this is what I am asking the hon. member to ponder .
rather than applying a mandatory minimum jail term in every case , why not give the courts some flexibility in structuring the penalties for the young joyrider in view of all the circumstances of the individual case ?
what about the youth who has no previous record ?
there are so many ways to handle this problem short of sending every young joyrider to prison .
a probation order for a first time offender combined with an order of restitution may be quite adequate .
i would also point out that it is unusual to see a custodial term imposed for a first offence of possession for stolen goods .
i do not see why we would opt for mandatory minimum of six months jail time for a first offence here .
i also cannot understand why the hon. member wants to take sentencing out of the realm of the Young Offenders Act .
the bill says , notwithstanding the Young Offenders Act , the offender is liable to a term of imprisonment .
the Young Offenders Act provides all the remedies needed in conjunction with a penalty structure of the Criminal Code .
section 3 of the Young Offenders Act sets out 10 principles that apply to the sentencing of youth offenders .
i quote the first principle :
crime prevention is essential to the long - term protection of society and requires addressing the underlying causes of crime by young persons and developing multi - disciplinary approaches to identifying and effectively responding to children and young persons at risk of committing offending behaviour in the future .
these principles should be applied so that all of the circumstances surrounding the offence , including parental involvement , can be considered .
i can see that Bill C - 209 would continue to require that young offenders be tried in youth court but I cannot understand why he would want to add a notwithstanding clause that would suddenly take sentencing outside the structure of the Young Offenders Act .
i have no objection to prosecutions under section 335 .
joyriding is a problem in itself , aside from damage to property or personal injury that may result from it .
in the last session , the government introduced a series of amendments to the Criminal Code in Bill C - 17 , which is now chapter 18 in the Statutes of Canada , 1997 .
these amendments included section 335 , a change that for some reason is not reflected in the hon. member ' s bill before us today .
the amendment deals with the responsibility of occupants of the vehicle .
young people who take cars often do so in the company of others and these passengers may be aware of their immunity from prosecution even when they clearly know that the car has been taken without the consent of the owner .
furthermore , it is often difficult to determine who took the vehicle when several young people are involved .
the new law solves this problem by making passengers liable to a charge of joyriding unless they make an effort to leave the vehicle .
this amendment shows that the government does take the section of the code very seriously .
let me give an example of how section 335 has been used .
in 1991 in a Saskatchewan case , an offender took a vehicle and claimed that he was going to use it to pull another vehicle out of the mud .
however , he made no attempt to restore the vehicle to its owner and the accused appeared to be responsible for the later destruction of the car in a fire .
the offender received a conditional discharge combined with 18 months of probation but he was forced to pay restitution to the victim for the loss of the vehicle .
this is an example of how section 335 in combination with the restitution sections in the Criminal Code can be used to benefit the victim where property damage and loss have occurred .
the amendment in Bill C - 209 is not really necessary .
let me give a quite different example .
this is an Alberta case .
the offender admitted to taking the vehicle for purposes of joyriding .
he began driving too fast , misjudged a turn and slammed into a trailer parked on the other side of the road .
of what was he convicted ?
not joyriding as the offender hoped , but rather dangerous driving , which carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and 10 years if there is personal injury .
finally , I wish to comment briefly on the second part of the bill which tries to make parents responsible for fines and damages incurred by a young person who is convicted of joyriding .
this idea was examined recently by both the House of Commons committee and a federal - provincial task force on youth justice .
neither group recommended that parents be required , under the Criminal Code , to pay damages for neglecting to exercise due care .
the task force did recommend that provinces develop legislation governing the civil recovery from grossly negligent parents for damages or losses arising from the criminal acts of their children .
i understand that Manitoba recently created legislation making parents civilly responsible to a limit of $ 5,000 where it is proven that the parents bore some responsibility for the offence .
in terms of the parents actually participating in an offence , the Criminal Code and the Young Offenders Act already contain offences of aiding and abetting .
for these reasons , I suggest that the amendments of Bill C - 209 are not needed and will not improve the capacity of the criminal justice system to deter joyriding .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
before we return to the debate , the Chair would confirm that the member for Fraser Valley West did not receive unanimous consent to have this bill made votable .
unanimous consent was not received .
this is for the record .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
the problem is not as bad as it seems or as the member from the Reform Party made it out to be .
let us call a spade a spade .
what does this subsection say ?
335 . ( 1 )
every one who , without the consent of the owner , takes a motor vehicle or vessel with intent to drive , use , navigate or operate it or cause it to be driven , used , navigated or operated is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction .
this is another offence which , while not being as serious as theft , is also punishable .
this is the case where a young person , or an adult for that matter , decides to use an automobile or another vehicle without the owner ' s consent , but does not have a criminal intent , has no intent to defraud , there is no fraudulent intention , and the lawmakers leave it up to the crown to decide whether to prosecute under section 322 of the Criminal Code or under subsection 335 ( 1 ) .
i think that , in a free and democratic society as ours in Canada and Quebec , it is healthy to let those who enforce the law use their head in laying charges to try to see what would be most appropriate in each case .
as the government member said earlier , the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada , in 1973 , however , not in 1972 , handed down a clear ruling in Lafrance v. Regina to the effect that the offence as worded in section 335 ( 1 ) is not a lesser offence than ordinary theft .
they created two separate offences , each with its own characteristics .
the two are distinct and the crown may decide on the charge according to the circumstances of the case .
this interpretation by the courts seems to show the effectiveness of the standard set by the present wording .
the amendments or speeches by Reform members I have heard sometimes seem to indicate an interest in seeing everything covered in the Criminal Code .
each situation would have its own section in the Criminal Code .
the goal would be to limit the judge ' s discretion as much as possible .
i have the impression that the Reform Party wants to see the courts turned into legal robots , heartless machines operating on the basis of sections , statistics , sometimes even stereotypes .
it looks like they want to remove any possibility of discretion , of a decision based on a particular case .
in the field of justice , I learned very early on that nothing is black and white .
in this field , as in many others , some things must be analyzed , and I think that judges in the existing system - if everyone does not agree with me on this , we have a big problem - have the training and the skill to analyze and judge the offence before them , which the crown has decided to prosecute under either section 322 or section 335 ( 1 ) .
once again , the intention is to prevent judges from exercising their discretion , from using stiff fines to make a distinction between cases .
it is true that sometimes this will be the result of a joyride , but other charges will be laid against the wrongdoer , the adolescent or young man who uses a car without the owner ' s consent , because damaging another person ' s property is also an offence .
and it is the crown prosecutors who look at the facts presented to them by the police and decide which sections they will rely on in court .
there is also a major shortcoming in Bill C - 209 , and you will agree with me that it is another reason to reject this bill .
it undermines the Young Offenders Act .
i know that when it comes to the Young Offenders Act , there is a tremendous gulf separating the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party .
i think we will never succeed in sharing the same views on this matter .
this is what I concluded when we studied the Young Offenders Act last year .
there is an attempt to increase the penalties for this offence .
let it be clear , I do not want to minimize that .
i have every reason to believe that today the courts are applying properly sections 322 and 335 ( 1 ) of the Criminal Code .
there is another reason why we should reject this bill - this will my last point - and it concerns parental responsibility .
in fact , I remember when I was 15 or 16 , I was attracted to cars .
are not all young people at that age attracted to cars ?
i am not saying that I stole cars , I am not saying that I used cars without my parents ' consent , but I was nevertheless attracted to cars , especially in a county like Berthier - Montcalm .
Berthierville is in that county , and with the Villeneuves , it is natural down there to be attracted to cars .
on a whim , the young person used a car .
does this make that child a criminal ?
i know that the members of the Reform Party would want that child to be called a criminal , but I tell you that is not the case .
that child , on a whim , used a vehicle .
in such a situation , the crown attorney can at his discretion decide to refer to theft under section 322 or to an infraction resembling theft , use without consent , under section 335 ( 1 ) of the Criminal Code .
i know that it upsets Reform members when they are told such truths , but that is what is found today in the Criminal Code .
i do not think the Criminal Code is the greatest thing since sliced bread , and there are things in it that should be changed .
if we really want to change it , let us review it completely , rather than trying to do patchwork , as the Reform Party is doing with Bill C - 209 .
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , Bill C - 209 brought forward by the member for Fraser Valley outlines the member ' s concerns about the serious increase in and problems with joyriding and car theft .
no one would question the concerns and the seriousness we have seen in Canada with the growing problem of car thefts which the bill seeks to address .
between 1990 and 1994 the number of car thefts increased by over 40,000 and the number of vehicles stolen per 1,000 registrations increased by 50 % .
it is generally known in the community that most car thefts are used for joyriding , in fact something like three - quarters .
there is a concern in the community that dangerous behaviour associated with joyriding makes it a threat to the safety of not only the police but the public and often tragically the joyriders themselves .
probably most of us are aware of various instances and circumstances that have taken place in our local communities and neighbourhoods which involve joyriding and often result in serious injury or even death .
in addressing this bill , which is non - votable and being debated for the record , there is also widespread agreement that we really need to examine new ways of dealing with crimes by young offenders .
in the NDP we believe very strongly - and there is a growing sense in the community - that we need to promote a renewed sense of social responsibility .
our focus must be on finding ways of making young offenders aware of the consequences of their actions .
that is important but most important is that the information and studies that have been done show the most critical actions we can take and the most effective things we can engage in are crime prevention and addressing the underlying issues which drive young people to antisocial behaviour and criminal activities .
unless we can understand the issues and provide the resources and tools to local communities to address underlying issues of antisocial behaviour and crime , the NDP believes that we will not make much progress .
there are different opinions on how we have to build a sense of responsibility among young offenders .
certainly for the member from the Fraser Valley the idea of minimum penalties for joyriding requiring parents to pay for their children ' s actions is seen as the way to go .
the bill before the House sets out a minimum penalty of a $ 1,000 fine or six months in prison .
it also stipulates that parents or guardians could be required to pay the fines or other penalties incurred by their children if it was felt somehow that their neglect of parenting duties resulted in the child committing the offence .
the problem with this approach is that there is little or no evidence to show that increasing penalties will actually work and will actually deal with the issue of joyriding or many of the other issues facing us in terms of increasing crime among young people .
that member ignored that Saskatchewan already incarcerates a higher proportion of youth than most provinces and has now recognized that it has not reduced crime .
simply criminalizing young people , throwing them in jail and increasing fines , has not dealt with the issue most people would recognize as a problem .
it is also very questionable whether simply holding parents responsible for the actions of their children will actually impact young people and make them consider the consequences of their own actions .
there are cases where better parenting may have prevented the child from committing an offence .
however , the more important point is that if the relationship between the parent and the child is so bad that the courts feel the parents have failed , it is not clear at all and there is no evidence to suggest that penalizing the parent will improve the situation .
it should lead us to be very suspicious of superficial approaches put forward by the Reform Party .
it should lead us to understand that these approaches have failed .
when looking at the bill we must ask ourselves how we will address the problem by having parents pay their children ' s fines .
holding parents responsible , even in a limited sense , for the crimes of their children sends out a wrong message .
when dealing with young people who have committed crimes , the goal should be to persuade them to take responsibility for their actions and to prevent these actions from taking place in the first place .
holding responsible someone other than the person who committed the crime seems to us to be a step removed from the objective .
the main problem with the bill is that we cannot deal with issues like joyriding in isolation .
we must address the social and economic conditions that cause these acts of antisocial behaviour , criminal acts in the first place .
we must also find more effective socially responsible ways to deal with young offenders .
criminal activity by our young people does not happen in a vacuum .
while it is important to state that each individual , whether a young person of 18 years of age or an adult , is responsible for his or her actions , we must recognize that there are societal factors at work which often push young people toward criminal activity .
if young people grow up in poor circumstances and in an environment that shows little respect for the rights and needs of children , we should not be surprised that children grow up not respecting society ' s rules .
one approach that is having some impact in terms of dealing with young offenders rather than jail sentences or penalties is to deal with restorative justice .
the objective is to bring about understanding and recognition of the damage that has been done to a victim or to a community at large .
in a program in Maple Ridge , British Columbia , local businesses allow young offenders to pay their fines by working at the local businesses .
there is an attempt to bring about better understanding of the crime that has taken place .
at the Maple Ridge program only 6 % of the participants reoffended in the following year .
we believe in the NDP that we need to understand the risk factors that increase the chances of a young person being victimized or engaging in antisocial behaviour .
we need to ensure early prevention for high risk youth .
we need to ensure we are investing in education .
we need to ensure families have good support in the community .
we need to ensure families have good paying jobs and that there are family friendly workplaces .
our concern with the bill is that the approach of the Reform Party is to further criminalize young people .
this is no answer .
it is an answer that may pander to the concerns of the community and may offer a very superficial response , but it does not deal with the underlying issues at work in terms of young people at risk .
we do not agree with the bill and suggest that it is a short - sighted measured to deal with what is a very serious problem .
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for Fraser Valley for bringing forward Bill C - 209 .
i also appreciate his thoughtful and rightful initiative in doing so .
we all know joyriding is a serious crime and a serious problem .
it is not a joyful ride .
it should be called a painful ride .
this problem affects communities all over the country and any one of us could be a victim of this crime .
we do not know who will be a target tomorrow in our communities .
the hon. member for Erie - Lincoln said even he was a victim of this crime .
it is disappointing to hear members from the third and fourth parties opposing the bill .
in my riding 27 cars are stolen every day .
most of them end up being used for a so - called joyride , which I call a painful ride .
the fine imposed for this type of crime is unproportional to the loss and damage caused , including the innocent lives which are lost in these types of accidents .
as a result of this , insurance premiums are increasing .
they are skyrocketing .
innocent victims are affected not only by the damage but also by the increased insurance premiums .
the hon. NDP member for Vancouver East stated that an increase in penalties , fines or holding the parents responsible will not help .
what else will help to reduce this type of crime ?
let us consider the record of other countries , such as Singapore .
there are no more joyrides in those countries because the penalties are harsh and tough .
young criminals know that the penalties are tough .
that is the way to control these crimes .
someone has to be held responsible for these painful rides .
who else will be held accountable ?
these young kids are stealing cars and going for joyrides .
why not hold the parents responsible ?
this is an excellent bill .
we need to bring about these changes .
measures to deal with joyriding should be in the Criminal Code .
someone has to take the initiative .
the parents should be held accountable for the actions of their kids who are not properly controlled .
i appreciate the initiative of the hon. member for Fraser Valley .
considering the seriousness of these crimes , we need to take corrective action and hold someone accountable .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
i recognize the hon. member for Fraser Valley .
the Chair should point out that as is the convention , as it is the member ' s bill , he will have five minutes but there will be no further debate at the conclusion of the five minutes .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it has been an interesting debate .
it is almost like a take note debate .
of course there will not be a vote on it because not all Private Members ' Business is votable which is unfortunate .
nevertheless it has been interesting to hear the different points of view from the different parties .
i always find it a little unfortunate in Private Members ' Business that people do not seem to listen to the speeches .
they all craft a speech in advance and regardless of what anybody might say in presenting their opinion , it is as if they had never said a thing .
therefore I would like to run through again very quickly the reasons for this bill .
the NDP member mentioned that we have to do things to prevent crime rather than just come down like a ton of bricks on someone who steals a car .
i went through the list .
i fully support that .
the trouble is we cannot put all of that in the Criminal Code .
of course I cannot put all of them into this bill .
i talked about the increased use of bike squads , getting out among the kids so they see a friendly police presence .
i talked about the increased use of crime stoppers , nipping the crime in the bud before it becomes a big problem in the community .
then we have the increased use of street crews as we call them in my area which deal not only with crime , but also with drug use , drug abuse and so on .
that is an initiative which works well in our area .
there is the block watch program where people look after not only their own assets but those of their community .
if they see kids trying to break into a car , they can stop the crime .
to prevent the crime of course is far better .
citizen patrols have been very successful in my riding .
the lock it or lose it campaign initiated by our local insurance company has been very successful .
ten to fifteen per cent of all auto thefts result from vehicles not being locked .
that is a shame .
it almost entices someone to steal .
we have an education program in our schools about the serious effect of this crime .
it is a very good program which should be continued and expanded .
all of this I believe is Reform Party policy as well .
parliament has the privilege and the requirement to say that we treat this as a serious crime .
by all means part of the restorative justice campaign is to pay back , to make restitution for damages , to pay for those crimes by perhaps working at the local stores .
one comment made in the speeches here today was that we should just make young people aware of the consequences of their actions .
they are well aware of the consequences of their actions .
two - thirds of young people who steal cars end up in an accident of some sort , many causing bodily harm .
if we send the message to young people that if they steal a car , wrap it around a telephone pole and get caught , they can figure on about $ 100 fine , those are the consequences .
these young people think they are immortal , they are young and do not think about the damage done to themselves or their friends .
they just drive hell bent for leather and often hurt themselves and others and the consequence is a $ 100 fine .
we need to send the message that the consequences are serious , that we treat this crime seriously .
we hope the young people will treat it seriously and that the courts , police and parents will treat it seriously as well .
all the talk about holding the parents responsible is very interesting .
i hope that everyone has read the bill and the sections that I have tried to amend .
in subsection 2 of the bill I brought forward today it says that notwithstanding all the other portions of the Young Offenders Act , if the court is of the opinion that the case would be best met by the imposition of a fine , damages or costs and the court is satisfied that the parent or guardian of the young person who contributed to the commission of the crime , then they can step in .
in other words -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
i regret , but the time has expired .
as no other member wishes to speak , and the motion has not been made a votable item , the time provided for consideration of Private Members ' Business has now expired and the item is dropped from the Order Paper .
the adjournment proceedings are to start in seven minutes .
is there unanimous consent ?
some hon. members :
agreed .

labour
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Oslo conference on child labour reflects a growing and worldwide concern about child labour , particularly the urgent need to eliminate its most extreme and intolerable forms .
all the delegates at the Oslo conference agreed that the countries of the world must take every step possible to suppress such atrocities as the sale and trafficking of children , forced and compulsory labour , debt bondage and child slavery , and the use of children for any type of work that is likely to jeopardize their health , their safety or their moral and social development .
the use of child soldiers in recent armed conflicts was identified as an issue that requires immediate and specific attention .
there was less than consensus opinion , however , on how to best address the larger issue of the 250 million child labourers between the ages of 5 and 14 who are forced to work to survive .
everyone everywhere agrees that poverty is both the root cause and a major consequence of child labour .
in that light strategies to fight poverty are central to any serious efforts to alleviate child labour .
canada falls short in this regard .
the international community has targeted 0.7 % of GDP as the level of industrial development aid .
canada now stands at 0.34 % , a drop of $ 780 million .
canada falls short in other tangibles as well .
the Canadian government says that it does not support the use of boycotts or labelling programs .
it does not agree that projects like the Rugmart labelling system will end the exploitation of children in the carpet industry even though there is broad support for that program in many parts of the world .
the government does not believe in legislation such as the Harken bill in the United States which bans the importation of goods made by bonded child labour .
it has refused for over 25 years to sign International Labour Organization convention No. 138 which deals with the minimum age of workers entering the workforce .
the government does not agree that international trade agreements must include labour standards in spite of the fact that speaker after speaker at the Oslo conference cited liberalized trade agreements as a key cause in the escalation of the use of child labour in the world .
consumers and governments in developed nations can and must use their purchasing power and any other instruments at their disposal to put pressure on those who participate in the economic exploitation of children .
voluntary compliance with codes of conduct will not help the child who sits chained to a loom as we speak .
do we know that consumer boycotts and non - tariff trade barriers work ?
the garment manufacturers of Bangladesh at the merest hint of a boycott by the United States cleared their workplaces of child labour within three years and now use the fact that they are child labour free as a marketing tool .
critics would say that boycotts result in these children being thrown out of the workplace and winding up in the streets or some worse form of exploitation .
my point is that there are 50 million child labourers in India and over 100 million heads of households who do not have meaningful work .
it is simple .
the government has not done enough .
when questioned on October 3 , the Minister of Foreign Affairs again repeated he was not willing to engage legislation and tools such as the Harken bill in the United States and he was not willing to sign convention No. 138 of the ILO .
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I also want to thank my hon. colleague from Winnipeg Centre .
some child experts question the effectiveness of measures such as the one my colleague has just been speaking about , that is banning imports of forced or indentured child labour .
the underlying cause of child labour is poverty and the long term solution is to attack poverty .
this point came out clearly in the speech of the minister for international development at the Oslo child labour conference last week .
the conference was hosted by the Norwegian government in conjunction with the ILO and UNICEF .
it unanimously adopted an agenda for action which appears consistent with our policy on the issue of child labour .
our efforts are focused on three issues : providing affordable access to primary education particularly for girls ; improving the status , role and economic security for women as equal partners in development ; and encouraging governments to enforce existing laws governing the employment of children .
canada is actively supporting the work of the ILO to develop a new convention by 1999 on the most intolerable forms of child labour including bonded labour .
canada is to host a preparatory meeting in Ottawa for principal donor countries that were invited to the Oslo conference .
within our region , the United States , Mexico and ourselves are examining the child labour and working conditions of young people .
our labour minister spoke at a trilateral conference in Ottawa last month which was attended by over 100 government , labour and NGO representatives .
we also believe that business can play a role that reinforces international action by government response to ethical , environmental and social concerns .
a private sector alliance developed an international code of business ethics for firms operating overseas .
railway TRANSPORTATION
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅 ( L 茅 vis , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , on October 24 , I put a question in this House to the Minister of Transport .
the secretary of state was quoted as saying that the station in L 茅 vis would close on December 1 and that rail service would be transferred to the north shore , in Sainte - Foy .
i thought that statement was rather strange , which is why I wanted to ask the Minister of Transport a question .
i asked him if the decision had been made at his level , even though there had been a recommendation by the national transportation agency .
he said no .
during question period in the House , we do not have much time .
i would like to use my time today to get further information on the subject I raised in my question .
i found the answer of the minister very interesting when he said :
we are looking at a number of options for rail service across the country .
on the matter of the L 茅 vis station , no decision has yet been made .
i will gladly consider any idea or opinion my colleague or anyone else might have on the subject before I make my decision .
afterwards , I called for public consultations and I tried to find out if the national transportation agency had held public hearings , because it did hold a few public hearings in 1991 .
but there were no public hearings this time because the NTA decided there would not be any .
because of public interest , since there had been no agreement between Via Rail and CN , the then Minister of Transport , under the Conservatives , decided , on March 16 , 1993 , to close L 茅 vis station .
it seems that the situation is the same today because , on February 22 , 1996 , CN got permission to abandon lines along the St. Lawrence River .
in the meantime , two trains stopped at the Charny station every day , but VIA announced in an internal bulletin that they would no longer stop in Charny , which means no more train station on the south shore .
today , I ask the transport minister ' s representative to help me by insisting that VIA Rail make all pertinent documents public , which it has refused to do until now , so that people can express an informed opinion .
Mr. Stan Keyes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , first , let me assure the hon. member for L 茅 vis that the minister is very aware of the situation involving the L 茅 vis station and he is intent on resolving the matter soon .
consultations with stakeholders and local community leaders have been ongoing since 1990 .
because of the very divergent views on the subject of the L 茅 vis station and the Montmagny line , a number of extensions have already been obtained in order to keep this station open .
first and foremost , the government ' s primary consideration is to ensure that any solution is safe and that it minimizes the inconvenience for the roughly 17,000 rail travellers who use the L 茅 vis station every year .
i know the hon. member for L 茅 vis is anxious about the situation in his riding , but I am sure that , at the same time , he would not want the minister to make any decision without first considering all the possible options .
the minister is extremely concerned about looking at all the options in order to make the right decision .
for this reason , the minister wrote some time ago to Mr. Ivany , the president of VIA Rail and asked for opinions with respect to the L 茅 vis station .
let me assure my hon. friend that his concerns have not gone unnoticed .
on behalf of the Minister of Transport , I would like to assure him that a decision on this matter will be made shortly .
in the meantime if the member learns of any opinions from his constituents at his hearings next week , please , I would ask him to forward them to the minister because I know that he is open to suggestions .
tip EMPLOYEES
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , on October 29 , I asked a question of the Minister of National Revenue concerning the employment insurance eligibility of tip employees .
the minister stated that consultations were ongoing between the Minister of Finance , the Minister of Human Resources Development and himself to find a solution to ensure that the policy implemented by the Quebec government is compatible with employment insurance eligibility .
i wanted to come back on the matter because , in a way , it requires urgent action .
the bill introduced in the National Assembly is now at the clause by clause study stage before a committee and we need to know if the federal government will make the necessary technical changes .
we must remember that the Quebec government wants tip employees to claim their tips , in consideration of which they could use those revenues for their employment insurance entitlement , something that is easily understandable .
the analysis made led to the conclusion that employers should collect only 20 % of tips to simplify the process .
we are waiting for the federal government ' s decision .
we know there was some kind of agreement in principle , but the regulatory change is yet to come .
would it be possible to have an announcement on the matter by the revenue minister , the Minister of Human Resources Development , the Minister of Finance or the three of them if they wish ?
we would like to finally go ahead with the new system designed by Quebec . I know that it could interest other provinces as well .
if the necessary regulatory changes were made , the new system could be implemented for the coming fiscal year , thus allowing tip employees to earn employment insurance benefit entitlement for the tips they actually earned .
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question .
in its 1997 budget , the Quebec government announced measures to help ensure that the tips of workers in the restaurant and hotel industry are reported and subject to tax .
it announced that this would be accomplished in part through new measures to be introduced in legislation which would oblige the workers to remit their tips to their employers .
the Quebec budget also announced that tips would be eligible income in the calculation of various social benefits , notably employment insurance .
prior to the Quebec budget announcement , Quebec officials had explained to federal officials that employees would be required to remit tips daily to employers who , in turn , would record them , withhold the appropriate deductions and return the remainder to the employees .
on that basis , Quebec was advised that tips would be insurable for employment insurance purposes because they would be employer controlled .
under the current employment insurance legislation , tips can only be regarded as insurable if they are employer controlled as a result of being remitted by the employee to the employer on an ongoing basis .
we are aware of the underlying objective of the Quebec government to curb the underground economy and address the under reporting of income , more specifically tips in restaurant and hotel industries .
the federal government also understands that following the publication of the Quebec proposals , major concerns were expressed by employers as to their added administrative burden .
as a result , Quebec considered a number of options for alleviating this burden and has asked the federal government to advise whether these changes would be acceptable for EI coverage purposes .
these are being actively reviewed .
i will assure the House that the federal government is aware of the importance of the issue and the tight time frame of the Government of Quebec to implement its program by January 1 .
the government is treating Quebec ' s request as top priority .
Quebec will soon be advised of the federal government ' s position on the matter .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted .
accordingly , this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
( the House adjourned at 6.41 p.m. )

canada PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD - SPEAKER ' S RULING
the Speaker :
i am now ready to rule on the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Fraser Valley on October 29 , 1997 concerning a government news release announcing the membership of the nominating committee for the proposed Canada pension plan investment board .
i thank the hon. member for Fraser Valley for raising the matter and for providing the Chair with a copy of the document in question , and I thank the Leader of the Government in the House for his comments on the matter .
the hon. member for Fraser Valley referred to a news release dated October 23 in which the Department of Finance announced the membership of a committee that will nominate candidates for the proposed Canada pension plan investment board .
he pointed out that clause 10 ( 2 ) of Bill C - 2 , the Canada pension plan investment board act specifically provides for this nominating committee and he reminded the House that this bill had only been taken up by the Standing Committee on Finance on October 28 .
thus , the hon. member argued , the Minister of Finance had established this nominating committee under the provisions of a bill not yet adopted by the House and not yet even considered by the standing committee .
according to the hon. member , the case he put before the House is much more serious .
he argued that , in designating a committee defined in clause 10 of Bill C - 2 , the Minister of Finance had acted as if the bill is sure to be passed in its present form .
in response to the arguments raised , the Leader of the Government in the House made the claim that the press release did not in any way seek to influence the House in its decision to adopt or reject the bill .
he added that the government ' s action was merely a prudent step so as to have sufficient lead time to prepare definitive appointments to the investment board if the bill were adopted .
i have carefully examined the submissions from the hon. member for Fraser Valley and from the government House leader .
i think it may be useful to review the sequence of events on this matter .
as I understand it , on October 8 , 1997 , the House adopted Bill C - 2 at second reading and referred it to the Standing Committee on Finance .
on October 23 , the Department of Finance issued its press release and the next day , on October 24 during question period the hon. member for Calgary - Nose Hill asked a question on the establishment of this nominating committee and its effect on legislation before the House .
the hon. government House leader replied that the government was simply acting responsibly in putting in place the arrangements necessary to proceed if the bill were adopted .
one of the first tasks of the Speaker , when dealing with a question of privilege , is to determine whether the matter has been raised at the earliest possible opportunity .
as I have just indicated , the hon. member for Calgary - Nose Hill brought this matter to the attention of the House during question period on the day following the issue of the news release .
clearly there was ample opportunity to raise the matter as a question of privilege at that time , yet three sitting days elapsed before the hon. member for Fraser Valley raised this question in the House .
now , if I may , I shall move on to the question of privilege per se , in order to determine whether any parliamentary privilege has been breached .
in the present case , the Chair cannot conclude that freedom of speech has been adversely affected since members will have the opportunity to debate Bill C - 2 and propose amendments to it , either in the finance committee or in the House during report stage .
one might further ask whether this action has unduly prejudiced debate in committee or in the House .
like Speaker Fraser in his October 10 , 1989 ruling on GST advertising , I would say that this House has never had any difficulty in expressing its opinions when dealing with controversial situations .
the House is a forum for debate and the consideration of different points of view .
members do not work in a vacuum .
they are constantly aware of pressures and factors outside the House itself .
while an action like this one may offend some hon. members , it would be hard to make a case that it prejudiced debate .
similarly , in examining the privilege of immunity from obstruction and intimidation , I cannot conclude that any hon. member has been obstructed in the performance of his or her parliamentary duties by the minister ' s action .
in deciding a question of privilege , the Speaker must find whether , prima facie , there is sufficient cause to set aside the business of the House so that the House can consider a breach of one of its privileges or , more generally , a contempt of its authority .
in this case , I find that no specific privilege has been breached .
the authority given to this House to debate freely has not been compromised , nor has there been any obstruction or intimidation of members .
nonetheless , the Chair acknowledges that this is a matter of potential importance since it touches the role of members as legislators , a role which should not be trivialized .
it is from this perspective that the actions of the Department of Finance are of some concern .
this dismissive view of the legislative process , repeated often enough , makes a mockery of our parliamentary conventions and practices .
that it is the Department of Finance that is complained of once again has not gone unnoticed .
i trust that today ' s decision at this early stage of the 36 th Parliament will not be forgotten by the minister and his officials and that the departments and agencies will be guided by it .
after very carefully reflecting on this matter , and for the specific reasons explained , I have concluded that the matter submitted by the hon. member for Fraser Valley does not constitute , prima facie , a breach of privilege .
i thank hon. members for their contributions to this discussion .

allotted DAY - GOODS AND SERVICES TAX
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) : moved :
that this House condemn the government for blatant unfairness to Quebec in the matter of the GST , the government having denied it compensation without letting it submit its arguments to an independent arbitration panel made up of three experts , the first to be appointed by the federal government , the second by the government of Quebec and the third jointly by the first two .
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron ( Verch 猫 res , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would simply like to mention that the Bloc Quebecois will split the first speech , with the member for Mercier speaking first followed by the member for Louis - H 茅 bert .
Mrs. Francine Lalonde :
Mr. Speaker , it is with a true sense of the importance of this motion that I table it in the House .
i will read it again :
that this House condemn the government for blatant unfairness to Quebec in the matter of the GST , the government having denied it compensation without letting it submit its arguments to an independent arbitration panel made up of three experts , the first to be appointed by the federal government , the second by the government of Quebec and the third jointly by the first two .
why did I move this motion ?
because we are convinced that Quebec is being treated with blatant unfairness regarding the harmonization of the provincial sales tax with the GST , compared to the three Atlantic provinces .
this is such a major restriction that , through its finance minister , the Government of Quebec undertook to put up $ 500 million , if the federal government agrees with Quebec ' s figures , to complete the incomplete business harmonizing .
it is extremely important to mention that , like the Bloc Quebecois ' position on this matter , this motion in no way constitutes an attack on the Atlantic provinces , which benefited from the federal proposal .
we have nothing against equalization , on the contrary .
but this is a completely different matter .
the way we see it , discouraged at being unable to convince all the provinces except for Quebec , which had readily agreed to harmonize , signing an agreement to that effect with the federal government back in 1990 , the federal government looked for some way of proving that it had acted , in part , on its promises .
finally , an agreement was reached with the Atlantic provinces , providing that they would harmonize their sales tax with the federal sales tax in exchange for $ 1 billion .
in so doing , and this is one of our main reasons for presenting this motion this morning , the federal government gave the Atlantic provinces the means to intensify economic competition , by enabling Mr. McKenna , who was Premier of New Brunswick at the time , to compete unfairly with Quebec using full page ads announcing that better conditions could be found in New Brunswick for businesses .
Quebeckers were stunned to see him do that .
in fact , the federal proposal allowed the Atlantic provinces to reduce their sales tax by four percentage points and to fully refund the tax paid by businesses on their input , which Quebec cannot do , since it paid for all this without any assistance .
how did the federal government achieve this result ?
simply by devising a formula designed to favour the maritimes .
without getting into details , the federal government ' s compensation formula provides that only the reduction of the sales tax level is to be compensated , and since that level exceeds 5 % , it means the formula was tailored to the needs of the Atlantic provinces .
hon. Jim Peterson :
it is true .
Mrs. Francine Lalonde :
this confirms that the federal government does not recognize the costs involved .
over a four - year period , the shortfall will be $ 1.9 billion , or $ 2 billion if you take into account the federal finance department ' s own figures .
moreover , the support does not only come from Quebec . When they met in St. Andrews , all the premiers supported Lucien Bouchard ' s claim for $ 2 billion .
so , everyone in Quebec and all the provincial premiers support it .
what are the federal government and the finance minister waiting for ?
in order to give a chance to the government , we say " Let us ask experts - one appointed by the federal government , one appointed by the Quebec government , and a third one appointed by the first two - to evaluate the amount '' .
if the government is so confident in its calculations , why does it refuse to establish such a committee ?
and I would also say that , if the Government of Quebec was worried , why would it go along with the idea of a committee ?
this is an extremely important issue .
so , if the government thinks it is right , then it should at least be willing to submit its figures to a panel of experts for review .
and if it is not willing , we will continue to say , with the support of Quebec ' s partners , with the support of Canada ' s premiers , that the central government treated Quebec with blatant unfairness in the matter of the harmonization carried out by that province , the first with the federal GST , a promise made by this government it will be recalled .
i hope that this motion will be passed unanimously by the House as a sign of minimal good faith towards Quebec .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie ( Louis - H 茅 bert , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , it is with pleasure that I take part in this debate on the opposition motion by the Bloc Quebecois , which asks :
that this House condemn the government for blatant unfairness to Quebec in the matter of the GST , the government having denied it compensation without letting it submit its arguments to an independent arbitration panel made up of three experts , the first to be appointed by the federal government , the second by the government of Quebec , and the third jointly by the first two .
let me outline the background for the motion moved today in the House of Commons .
Quebec did what it had to and harmonized its sales tax .
it did so without any financial assistance .
there were of course considerable financial costs involved .
these costs were absorbed by increasing the tax burden for corporations and by applying restrictions to input tax refunds .
under the Quebec sales tax system , large corporations can apply for an input tax refund only on certain goods and services acquired to conduct their business .
for these corporations , this represents additional costs totalling $ 500 million annually .
so those who are in fact being penalized by the federal government , which refuses any financial compensation for the Government of Quebec , are Quebec businesses .
these still cannot benefit from the tax breaks that harmonization gave to competing firms in the three Atlantic provinces .
this situation is especially unfair when you consider that the tax benefits given to corporations in the Atlantic provinces were in part financed by the taxes paid by individuals and businesses in Quebec .
with this compensation , the Atlantic provinces were able to harmonize their sales tax in one single operation .
in Quebec , harmonization is not yet completed ; it is being phased in over several years due to the fact that it is impossible to remit the input tax refund to businesses because this would entail , according to conservative estimates , a loss of around 10 % in provincial sales tax revenues .
the federal government also announced that Quebec , the only jurisdiction to have harmonized its tax , could not benefit from this new readjustment program .
questions are being raised concerning this financial compensation program .
was it designed so that only certain groups could receive this funding ?
it should be noted that the share of provincial sales tax revenues compared to total tax revenues for 1994 was 8.6 % for Quebec compared to 12.9 % for the Atlantic provinces .
these figures are real and can be verified , since they come from statistics on government revenue published by the OECD and Statistics Canada .
the federal government established that the compensation is equal to 100 % of the cost of harmonisation exceeding 5 % of the provincial sales tax returns before harmonisation for the first two years , 50 % for the third year and 25 % for the fourth year .
Quebec believes it is entitled to compensation and the Bloc Quebecois supports that claim .
this compensation would represent an amount of $ 273 per person , which is clearly less than the amount of $ 423 paid to the Atlantic provinces .
yet , the federal government still refuses to pay compensation to Quebec on the ground that harmonization of the PST and GST has cost it nothing .
now , one only has to look at the public accounts and budget documents to see the magnitude of the costs involved .
the annual conference of premiers of August 1996 , which was held in Jasper , supported the position of the Quebec finance minister by saying that all provinces should benefit equally from the agreements on harmonization , including compensation .
we have had support from various sources .
participants to the 1996 socio - economic summit , even the Leader of the Opposition in Quebec , whose political leanings are well known , supported Quebec ' s position .
last but not least , premiers meeting in St. Andrews in 1997 renewed their support for Quebec ' s position .
on the strength of such overwhelming support , the Bloc Quebecois would like the federal finance minister to admit his calculations are flawed .
this is the reason why , during the last federal election campaign , the Bloc Quebecois leader asked the Liberal government to create an independent arbitration panel to put an end to the deadlock .
to this day , the minister has turned a deaf ear to this request .
he insists his numbers are accurate and says that he has taken the right decision .
why then is he so afraid to face independent experts and show he is right when Quebec ' s deputy premier and finance minister are willing to compare their numbers with Paul Martin ' s so that justice may be done ?
the Bloc Quebecois believes that voting against this motion means that the arguments used so far by the federal finance minister would not stand the comparison with Quebec ' s .
we want to settle this dispute once and for all so that independent experts may come to a clear and fair decision .
i would even go so far as to amend the motion .
therefore I move :
that the motion be amended by deleting the word " blatant " and substituting the following therefor : " flagrant '' .
Mr. Alex Shepherd ( Durham , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I listened with intent to the hon. member for Mercier and also the last intervener .
the harmonization of the GST is a positive thing economically .
i will give one example .
my riding is highly influenced by General Motors which pays provincial sales tax on its input costs .
when it exports it does not get a relieving provision which is what the GST basically does .
it means that the costs for automobiles manufactured in Ontario and landed in the United States are greater than for those produced in St. Therese , Quebec , for instance .
the fact that Quebec harmonized the GST quickly gave it a tremendous economic advantage .
if there is anyone who should receive compensation I would argue that it is the laggers such as my own province , which has refused to move into the area of harmonization .
the Quebec economy has received great economic advantage for doing that early .
i wonder if that is part of the calculation , how much benefit has been realized from looking forward to export trade which Quebec has already received by harmonizing quickly .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie :
madam Speaker , the member is right on one thing : we had a vision .
we were the first ones , in 1990 , to harmonize our tax without expecting anything in return .
speaking of shortfall , we feel it is only fair to receive compensation .
a loss of $ 500 million on inputs is a lot of money for Quebec businesses .
if they want to argue over numbers , let us talk numbers .
Mr. Ren 茅 Laurin ( Joliette , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , our colleagues on the other side seem to forget one thing when they say the sales tax harmonization was profitable for Quebec .
of course we benefited from that , but we paid what was required for it before we could reap the benefits .
i would compare that situation to a landlord investing $ 100,000 in renovations on a house in order to increase the rents afterwards .
they will only take into account revenues and advantages obtained by Quebec because it implemented harmonization voluntarily but they will refund New Brunswick since that province was somehow forced into harmonization because the Liberal government wanted to show it had changed its GST .
when comparing things , one should do it properly .
if the government is so certain it was not both judge and jury in this instance , it should submit its figures to a committee , as we are asking .
let the government submit its data and let the committee look at them impartially .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie :
madam Speaker , I would like to add a comment to what my colleague just told the House .
in any case , consumers would have been very unhappy .
the fact that a sales tax is calculated only on the sales tax and not on the tax base harshly penalizes the province of Quebec . We will get back to this later today .
however , we demonstrated a lot of wisdom .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the amendment proposed by the member for Louis - H 茅 bert is in order .
hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , the reason why Quebec and other provinces entered into an agreement with Canada to harmonize sales taxes is very clear .
instead of two taxes , there is only one ; a single tax base , a single tax form and a single tax administration .
for small and medium size businesses this means an end to the burden of overlap and duplication .
this is the reason why Quebec entered into an agreement with Canada .
Quebec acted in a very practical manner .
with today ' s motion , the Bloc is again shooting blanks .
its motion is based on the wrong assumption that harmonization of the Quebec sales tax and the GST was unfair to Quebec .
i would like to go over some facts which have been pointed out many times in this House over the last few years .
in a sense , what the Bloc is doing today is really business as usual , it is twisting the facts to try to discredit the federal system , a system which has no place in the separatists ' future .
on several occasions , our government went over the facts with representatives of Quebec and explained to them why Quebec did not meet the objective eligibility requirements for adjustment assistance .
moreover , officials received a detailed technical brief on this subject explaining , among other things , our federal program .
in 1996 , provinces were offered an adjustment assistance if they were willing to implement a value added tax which would be fully harmonized with the GST and who , as a result , would suffer significant losses in sales tax revenues .
it has been clearly demonstrated that Quebec demands did not meet the factual eligibility requirements to get this kind of financial assistance .
in the preset formula , we consider that significant losses should be higher than 5 % of sales tax revenues .
the trigger level has been set at 5 % for two reasons .
first of all , heavier losses between 7 % or 8 % would be too hard to factor in , and the revision of already established fiscal plans a difficult exercise .
and losses of less than 5 % are similar to normal revenue variations governments can adjust to when they reorganize their programs and services .
secondly , the same percentage is used , and for the same reasons , in the federal stabilization program .
with this formula , Ontario , Quebec , British Columbia and Alberta would not qualify for assistance .
sales tax revenue losses in Quebec would not have been high enough to warrant any adjustment assistance .
moreover , the stated goal of the Quebec sales tax initiative was not only to avoid any revenue loss , but also to generate higher revenues .
since the tax was harmonized , revenues have gone up $ 3.46 billion .
they did not drop .
even the Quebec government public accounts confirm this .
what the Quebec government is trying to do right now is to include annual losses resulting from a reduction in the tax rate on fuel and tobacco products .
that has nothing to do with the sales tax .
with these losses excluded , the amount the Quebec government is demanding would be $ 1 billion less .
elimination of other irregularities would bring the estimated amount to zero .
the Quebec government has also underestimated by more than $ 300 million its harmonized sales tax revenues .
the federal government co - operated fully with Quebec officials in these discussions and this analysis .
in August 1996 , we provided Quebec with the precise method used to determine adjustment assistance , the results of our calculations and the figures Quebec could use to determine its own eligibility .
the federal government had numerous discussions and exchanges of information in order to clarify its numerous figures .
once again in the history of our great country , facts prove that Quebec , far from suffering a loss , benefited in fact from Canadian federalism by harmonizing its provincial sales tax with the GST .
that is the only role of the Bloc Quebecois .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I would like to ask a question to the Liberal member .
our offer is to appoint an independent committee of experts that would analyze our numbers and the government ' s numbers .
if this assessment would show that we are wrong , we would humbly admit it .
however , if we are right , the committee would have the power to force the federal government to pay the $ 2 billion .
that is my first remark .
i have a second one .
if this is like shooting blanks and if this is a feeble attempt by the Bloc Quebecois to sow dissension , I would like the member to explain to me how it is that all provincial premiers , who are not members of the Bloc Quebecois - Mr.
Harris and Mr. Clark are not members of the Bloc Quebecois - support the Quebec government in this request for a payment of $ 2 billion ?
i would like him to explain this to me .
hon. Jim Peterson :
madam Speaker , it is obvious .
we openly and on several occasions provided the details of our program .
according to its own calculations , the Quebec government did not incur any loss of sales tax revenues .
following harmonization , the province ' s sales tax revenue increased by more than $ 3 billion .
the figures were openly discussed with Quebec officials .
for all those who remain objective in this debate and really want to know the facts , instead of trying to demolish the Canadian Confederation , the facts are so obvious that it is pointless to waste any time discussing them .
Mr. Ghislain Lebel ( Chambly , BQ ) :
rather than having a higher income tax rates they had chosen , as a way to collect taxes , to have a higher sales tax .
rather than having a fairer tax rate they had preferred to have a higher tax rate .
the fact remains that harmonization has cost and is still costing a lot of money to the Government of Quebec .
i would like to ask a question to the minister who just spoke .
if there had been a sovereignist government rather than a federalist one in Quebec City when this deal was signed in 1990 might things have been the same ?
in fact , I put this question to Quebecers :
do you see how a federalist government in Quebec City has served us in the harmonization process with the federal government ?
i would like him to answer that .
hon. Jim Peterson :
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , it is a pleasure to rise to this motion today .
i must tell members that our party will be standing in opposition .
i do think that my hon. friends from the Liberal Party and from the Bloc both missed the most important point .
i want to make my argument on three different tracks .
first of all , while we know that the Atlantic provinces did receive compensation in the harmonization deal , we should not assume for a moment that compensation was the right thing to do .
second , if it was wrong to give that money to Atlantic Canada , then it is equally wrong to offer that kind of compensation , if you want to call it that .
i think it is euphemistic to call it compensation .
it is wrong to offer it to Quebec .
finally , we should point out that Quebec entered into this deal willingly .
it asserted its independence and made this deal quite willingly in 1991 .
i want to expand on those points .
the first thing is was the money that was paid to Atlantic Canada really compensation ?
we should ask ourselves how this all came to pass .
we look back on this , back to 1993 , to the deputy prime minister ' s promise on national television about scrapping the GST .
we all know about the sorry episode that followed thereafter .
we ended up with the deputy prime minister ' s having to resign and run in a byelection .
she was eventually demoted .
she lost her job as the deputy prime minister .
it was a sorry episode in the history of the Liberal Party .
of course , what happened when the government was trying to find some way to make it look like it fulfilled its promise , it rushed out to Atlantic Canada and said " we will give you $ 1 billion in political hush money if you will go along with our harmonization deal '' .
where do my friends in the Bloc think that comes from , that billion dollars ?
it does not just come from the mint .
we do not just print it .
it comes from taxpayers , including from taxpayers in Quebec who already face the highest tax burdens in the country almost and probably in certain ways they do .
we need to remember that taxpayers had to cough up that billion dollars from all across the country .
they never have and they never will .
we absolutely disagree with the premise .
the government is talking about a fiscal dividend , however we want to define that , but certainly it will have a surplus .
instead of that money going toward reducing the debt , which sits at $ 600 billion , instead of reducing the tremendous tax burden that people face in this country , personal income tax rates that , relative to our G - 7 trading partners , are 52 % higher than the average , which is absolutely shameful , instead of granting relief to those people , including the people of Quebec who stagger under even higher burdens than the Canadian average , according to the Bloc Quebecois plan we are going to give the money to governments to do with it what they will .
we argue that the money is much better left in the hands of taxpayers .
we will make that argument forcefully over the next several months as that issue grips the nation .
it is certainly a big issue today .
we say let us remember where that money is coming from .
the final point I want to make is that Quebec is the one that entered into this deal willingly , presumably because it thought it would help its economy .
they did make their own deal .
now they are saying " we have decided that we want to change our mind ; not only did we make a bad decision back then but we want compensation for making a bad decision '' .
they cannot have it both ways .
i point out to my friends in the Bloc that almost every program we have in this country today is a transfer program of some kind .
inevitably my friends in Quebec do extraordinarily well , which is one of the most compelling arguments we can make to keep them in Confederation .
why in the world would they step out into the great unknown when they know that they have not only very generous equalization programs but even in programs like the Canada health and social transfer they do extraordinarily well .
even the infrastructure program was based on a formula that included unemployment so that higher unemployment provinces like Quebec got more money .
what about employment insurance ?
huge amounts of money are sent into a province like Quebec because we have regionally extended benefits primarily as an inducement to keep provinces like Quebec in the fold .
i am making the point that Quebec has already done extraordinarily well by Confederation .
with the greatest of respect to some of my friends in the Bloc , this is beyond the pale .
they are simply asking too much .
i am going to conclude simply by saying that compensation to Quebec for the GST deal which it entered into sets a horrible precedent .
Canadians simply cannot afford it .
if we do it for Quebec then we need to do it for every province .
we are talking about not a few billion but tens of billions of dollars .
Ontario would want $ 3 billion and on and on it would go .
where is this money supposed to come from ?
where does it come from ?
it comes from the pockets of ordinary Canadians .
we simply cannot afford to tax them ever more to give money to provincial governments .
it is absolutely ridiculous .
that is the first point I want to make in summarizing as we enter this whole debate about the fiscal dividend .
let us not give the money away before we even get to the point where we have some money to give away .
second , let us remember that two wrongs do not make a right .
it does not make any sense that because money was paid to Atlantic Canada as sort of political hush money because of a dirty political promise that the then deputy prime minister made that it necessarily follows that we give the money to Quebec .
that is ridiculous .
two wrongs do not make a right .
every child knows that and I am surprised that some members in the House do not understand that .
i point out to my friends in the Bloc that they entered into this deal willingly .
they made that decision in 1991 and rushed headlong in .
they undoubtedly will enjoy the benefits of harmonization .
they claim they already have .
are they to argue then that if they do better in the long run on harmonization than they projected they will turn some of the benefit back to the federal government ?
i doubt it .
i do not think we will hear that .
let me conclude by saying that Reformers will be voting against this motion .
we think it is a foolhardy motion .
we think the best solution of all is to take that fiscal dividend and turn it back to ordinary Canadians to spend in the most productive way possible .
Mr. Alex Shepherd ( Durham , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I was happy to hear the member for Medicine Hat admit that the harmonization system may well be a benefit .
it seems to me it was that party that argued against the harmonization in this House .
i listened with intent as the member talked about the importance of reducing taxes and getting taxes back in the hands of everyday Canadians .
he also asked where the money was coming from .
we have in this country a program of equalization payments .
it is a very complex formula but basically the object is to bring everybody in the country to common standards in health and education .
through the mechanism of the equalization payments certain portions of this country are already sending money to the Atlantic provinces .
as a nation we want to build a dynamic economy .
one of the features is a harmonized sales tax in the Atlantic provinces to allow those provinces to compete internationally .
it reduced taxes and allowed more disposable income in the hands of Atlantic Canadians .
can they not see that ?
Mr. Monte Solberg :
madam Speaker , I am surprised that the hon. member does not recall the debate a little better .
one of the reasons that the Reform Party opposed this was precisely that it raised taxes in Atlantic Canada on the most vulnerable Canadians .
as members of the NDP pointed out , in those provinces we were going to see an actual reduction in the cost of a yacht but on essentials like fuel for heating their homes and children ' s clothing we were going to see increased prices .
how can the member stand there and say that somehow this is a benefit to the people who are most vulnerable in Atlantic Canada ?
it is absolutely ridiculous .
i also point out to my hon. friend that part of this deal stipulates that it takes only a majority of the provinces to raise the rate for the harmonized sales tax but an absolute unanimity of all the provinces to lower it .
in having a debate today about what to do with the fiscal dividend , we would need all the provinces on board to say we are going to lower that rate in order for Canadians to enjoy tax relief from the harmonized sales tax .
why in the world would people who want to see some tax relief today stand up and support that type of deal when it essentially guarantees they will never see tax relief on the harmonized sales tax front ?
it is a crazy idea .
Mr. Joe Comuzzi ( Thunder Bay - Nipigon , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I want to ask the member from Medicine Hat a couple of questions with respect to the speech he just gave .
i am a bit disturbed by the tone of the debate .
an hon. member :
oh , oh .
Mr. Joe Comuzzi :
i see my colleague opposite , in his anger , has not yet begun to pay attention to what is happening .
if he would wait I am sure he would get an opportunity to speak in due course .
that is a rule of the House .
the tone of the debate seems to be heading toward divisiveness and the fostering the divisiveness in the country that we are all trying to correct .
as a result of what the member for Medicine Hat just said in the House , does he agree with the following two points ?
first , the House of Commons has a fundamental role when a country is as big as Canada .
some areas are more productive than others .
should we as a federal state be responsible for the distribution of the wealth in order to look after people living in certain regions who are not as fortunate to have the same natural resources as perhaps the people in his province ?
second , he talked about the surplus and a tax dividend .
should we not first be looking at improving health care , improving the educational system and improving the transportation system ?
are they not the best places to put our funds ?
Mr. Monte Solberg :
madam Speaker , the most important role of the federal government is to ensure equality of provinces , to ensure that provinces are treated equally .
that does not rule out equalization .
our party agrees with equalization .
we do not happen to think that three provinces should support seven .
we should also pay attention to outcomes .
most of them cannot find one today .
Canadians disagree with the hon. member when he says that we should pour more money into spending .
only 13 % want to see some spending .
instead of spending more money in absolute terms , we should focus some of the spending , take it out of unproductive areas of which there are many in government and focus it on areas that are important to people like health care , education , and research and development .
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - Orl 茅 ans , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , in Quebec we have a beautiful motto , Je me souviens .
in Quebec , we remember the love demonstration of October 27 , 1995 , just three days before the October 95 referendum , when people from English Canada came to tell us how much they loved us .
i would like my fellow citizens from Quebec who are watching us to realize how English Canada and the Reform Party love us : on our knees , on all four .
we are not able to stand up .
we have here a clear demonstration of how much they love us .
here is my question to the hon. member .
in his speech , he made much of the fact that Quebec is costing a great deal to Canada , particularly in terms of unemployment insurance .
so let us go then ; we want to go away .
let us leave !
yes , let us go , we want to leave , that is exactly what we would like to do .
Mr. Monte Solberg :
madam Speaker , Canadians are asking us to find a way to unite the country , not let them go .
the best way to unite the country is to bring economic prosperity to all and to treat all Canadians equally .
we have the highest tax rates in the G - 7 .
we have to get rid of the $ 600 billion debt and give the people of Quebec , not the politicians , more money in their pockets so they can carve out their own lives and realize their own destinies .
we do not need big government , whether it be in Quebec City or in Ottawa , telling people how to live their lives .
let us leave money in their pockets .
Mr. Michel Guimond :
madam Speaker , I would like you to rule on some terms the hon. member used earlier in his speech .
i would like you to indicate to this House if the word " stupid " is in order and can be used in our discussions here .
i would like your advice on this matter .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
we will review the blues and inform the hon. member of our decision .
in the meanwhile , we will resume debate .
the hon. member for Kamloops has the floor .
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , it is a joy for many of us to have the opportunity today to talk about the most dreaded , hated tax that has ever been levied in the country .
i guess we could say we are talking about two dreaded taxes , the harmonized sales tax in certain provinces and the GST which symbolizes most what Canadian taxpayers feel is the ultimate betrayal in recent political history .
i refer back to the election when the Liberals first came to power .
they called it a hated tax , a payroll tax , a tax that would destroy jobs , a job killer .
then when they were on the verge of becoming government they said if elected they would scrap the tax , abolish it , do away with it , because it was an evil , bad tax .
they promised that if they were elected the GST would be gone , would be history , would be scrapped , would be abandoned , would be finished , would be abolished .
many Canadians thought that meant the tax would go away , that the government would actually do away with the dreaded tax .
obviously it was one of the most regressive taxes ever levied in the country because it did not discriminate between the rich and the poor .
when a rich person buys snow tires and a winter battery , he or she will pay exactly the same tax as the poor person buying the same items .
it does not make any difference .
obviously it is a very regressive tax .
i am not saying any individual lied , but a whole group of individuals lied called Liberal candidates .
after the election the government decided that rather than abolish or scrap the GST as was promised it would harmonize the GST .
harmonize is a good word .
the harmonized tax was to blend provincial and federal taxes .
i was shocked when the Government of Quebec acted so enthusiastically .
it said that this was a great idea .
i will let my friends in the Bloc explain why this sort of enthusiastic cheerleader approach was followed .
i never understood it .
all the evidence I saw at that time , all the evidence I have seen since and all the evidence I have on my desk before me today indicate that taxpayers pay more under the blended tax .
the short and long of it is that taxpayers will pay more .
some might say that might be the NDP analysis .
let us refer to someone other than the New Democratic Party of Canada .
what about the dominion bond rating agencies ?
they thought they should do a very thorough summary , at least in the Atlantic provinces , to find out the impact of the blended sales tax in what they called the maritimes .
i will read two or three of the summary comments .
they stated that there would be a net revenue loss for the provinces .
that is not surprising .
that is what everybody predicted .
they stated that consumers would not benefit .
probably one of the ultimate goals was to hide the GST so that people would not be reminded every time they bought a good or a service that they were being taxed by the federal government .
the idea was to hide it from the consumer , and the blended sales tax would do that .
the analysis of the dominion bond rating agencies goes on for pages and pages .
i could quote it until the time I have for my presentation runs out .
they said there were two losers : provincial governments and consumers .
they said the net benefit for business was negligible if at all .
the availability of input tax credits was offset by the imposition of new taxes , as well as taxation on newly generated income .
who benefits from it ?
the federal government sees it as a way to get off the hook , but it could not fool most Canadians so easily as presumably the Government of Quebec was fooled .
it must have had its reasons .
what about the Atlantic provinces ?
i guess he said that the Government of Quebec had been conned and they had to be onside to get this thing happening .
the Atlantic premiers thought they would lose money .
the premiers could probably be bought off for a billion dollars .
they could do a lot of politicking with an extra billion dollars , and so they did .
the three Liberal premiers of the Atlantic Canadian provinces of Newfoundland , Nova Scotia and New Brunswick accepted a billion dollar bribe to force the blended sales tax , the harmonized sales tax , on the citizens of the three provinces .
in other words , the Liberal Government of Prince Edward Island would have to go to the people soon .
its members said that they could never sell it , that they did not have time to brainwash the people of Prince Edward Island , that they could never con them or fool them into believing it was good for them .
the evidence was mounting by the day .
the Liberal Premier of Prince Edward Island said they could not be bought , could not be bribed , and would not be part of it .
indeed it is not a part of it to this day .
now there is a Conservative Premier of Prince Edward Island .
the last thing he will try to do is jam the blended sales tax down the throats of the people of Prince Edward Island .
the people of Prince Edward Island know what it will do to them .
what will it do ?
the Standing Committee on Finance finished a tour of Atlantic Canada .
we went to all the capital cities .
we talked to people about the economic and fiscal situation of Canada .
a number of them indicated that the fact the average family in Atlantic Canada had to pay the blended sales tax meant the average family was paying out as much as $ 600 more a year in taxes .
my friends across the way on the Liberal benches should be hanging their heads in shame , running out the back door and having a coffee .
we know that unfortunately a large number of people in Atlantic Canada do not have jobs period .
if the average working family is making less than $ 20,000 , imagine the devastating inhuman impact an increase in taxes of $ 600 a year would mean to those families .
it means necessities have to be abandoned .
one of the most troubling days of my life as an elected representative was the day I went into an elementary Christian school in my constituency .
we talked about the life of an MP and what we did , that part of the job was to raise money to do good works .
that was the kind of theme I was trying to develop .
i even have to pay a tax on my Bible '' .
i have 20 minutes , Madam Speaker , and I have not spoken for 20 minutes .
the little girl felt it was unjust that she was paying the GST on her religious story books for Sunday school and on the Bible .
she asked me to explain why we were doing this to her .
i could not explain .
i did not want to say that the Liberals were cruel or that they had imposed this regressive tax because I do not think it is fair for a young child to hear that kind of message .
i said that sometimes governments just do odd and silly things , inappropriate things .
many other terms were on my lips at that time but I was in a Christian school -
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i must advise the hon. member that his time was only 10 minutes , being the third speaker to address this subject .
if the hon. member has the unanimous consent of the House , he could go on for another eight or nine minutes .
some hon. members :
agreed .
Mr. Nelson Riis :
madam Speaker , I thank my colleagues for this extension .
i will conclude my remarks quickly .
what is more important than what I have said so far is the fact that in my judgment the imposition of the GST and now the blended sales tax , the HST , is the straw that broke the back of the Canadian taxpayer .
people knew that our tax system was unjust , unfair and biased .
there is no question about that .
it broke the will of people to comply with the tax system of our country so the economy started to move underground in a serious way .
the most popular books for about three months of the year on Canada ' s news stands are on how to beat the tax man , how to evade taxes .
look in this morning ' s paper .
on the financial pages there were a number of seminars on how to move taxes offshore , how to set up an offshore tax haven .
these seminars are being held in the capital city .
people have lost faith in our tax system so they are finding ways and means to avoid paying taxes .
although I have seen no empirical evidence I suspect a lot of Canadians these days are not paying the taxes they are actually obligated to pay , in the underground economy or whatever .
i am loath to say these are bad citizens because they know our system is so corrupt .
as my friend said earlier , people in Atlantic Canada know the tax system is wrong when there are folks who buy expensive yachts and get tax breaks while they now have to pay extra taxes on their children ' s winter clothing , on their books and school supplies and on heating fuel .
it penalizes the working poor , the jobless and the victims of an economic downturn .
they are punished and treated more cruelly under this blended sales tax .
i look at my friends across the way in the Liberal Party .
they are nice people but why do they continue to perpetuate this cruel tax on us ?
why do they keep telling people they are going to tax children ' s clothing and books ?
with the money being taken out by increased GST premiums , increased payroll taxes and so on , every dollar we can put back into the small and medium size communities and rural areas of Canada would be helpful , to say nothing of the urban areas .
they need it simply to live .
we think that the enthusiastic endorsement of the Government of Quebec on the blended sales tax was wrong .
we believe that the bribe to Atlantic Canada was wrong in principle .
therefore we obviously are not supportive of this motion that would simply give another bribe to Quebec to say thank you for joining in this rather odd and peculiar tax scheme .
with that I will say , obviously we are not going to be supporting this initiative put forward by my friends in the Bloc .
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - Orl 茅 ans , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , we all know the values that are dear to the New Democratic Party .
this is a party that promotes more fairness , justice and openness .
i have to tell you that I find the statements made by the hon. member for Kamloops , and particularly his conclusion , rather confusing .
i do hope he was not talking on behalf of his party .
i do hope this is not the final position of his party .
however , I would like the hon. member to tell us if he thinks the province of Quebec was treated fairly and appropriately .
the province of Quebec agreed , in all good faith , to harmonize its sales tax in 1991 and never received any compensation for it .
on the other hand , the Atlantic provinces harmonize their tax and are compensated .
according to his deep values and principles , does the hon. member think this is a fair , normal and acceptable way to treat the province of Quebec ?
Mr. Nelson Riis :
madam Speaker , my friend makes a very convincing argument .
first , I do speak for my party .
no , we do not think it is fair .
we think the point being made in today ' s opposition day debate is reasonable .
there was an unfairness .
the people of Quebec through their government were not treated equitably or fairly .
they were not treated in the same fashion as the people in the three Atlantic provinces were treated .
however , he used the term compensation , which is a fair term .
i use the term bribe .
i do not believe that bribes are appropriate in any circumstance .
i do believe that the provinces in Atlantic Canada were bribed quite frankly .
it is a cruel and very brutal term but not believing in bribery I cannot say that knowing they were bribed we should probably bribe another province as well .
my friend ' s point is well taken .
there was an injustice .
yes some provinces were treated differently from other provinces .
more particularly the province of Quebec was not treated in the same way the other provinces were treated .
they were given a bribe and Quebec was not .
Mr. Alex Shepherd ( Durham , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I listened intently to the member for Kamloops as I always do .
i suppose that if , when my government showed up at this House in 1993 there had been no GST , things would have been a lot different .
the reality is that it had been implemented .
the member talked about being on the finance committee .
i did that trip .
only we were talking about a harmonized tax at the time .
the small and medium sized business people said resoundingly " Harmonize the tax .
we are dealing with two administrations here .
it is ridiculous .
the bureaucratic overlap and duplication for small businesses is inefficient '' .
it was that initiative , to make a dynamic economy , to get more money in the hands of Atlantic Canadians which we strove for .
having said that , it is not just Canada .
all these countries have moved toward a consumption tax .
i agree with the member when he says it is a retrogressive tax in the sense that it affects all income groups the same .
what I cannot understand is the member ' s acceptance of having said that and at the same time arguing for a reduction in the rate because if it is retrogressive on the upscale , it is retrogressive on the downscale .
when those reductions are given , they are being given to the wealthy just as they are being given to the poor .
why would the NDP members not argue for a more targeted tax cut ?
why do they want to reduce a retrogressive tax ?
Mr. Nelson Riis :
madam Speaker , my friend ' s question is a very valid one .
i want first of all to say that while there was some enthusiasm on the part of business for a blended sales tax , I think it was also predicated on the fact that they were assuming it would be blended across the country .
increasingly as companies do business across provincial lines and internationally , this adds even more confusion in terms of the business that they do .
however , we will set that aside and I will answer my friend ' s question directly .
our position as a political party is that we would like to see the eventual phase out of the GST .
as we get into a more fiscally realistic era it would make sense .
tax cuts obviously will become a reality one day .
we simply cannot afford that as a country at this point .
therefore , a phase down to us makes more sense .
a phase down of the GST would create a lot more jobs than an across the board corporate tax cut , an across the board personal tax cut .
i agree that some selected tax expenditures would be appropriate as well , but the GST phase down would put money in people ' s pockets immediately and hopefully one day we would see the end of the dreaded GST .
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) :
madam Speaker , we support harmonization with the provinces provided they are all treated equitably .
because the Government of Quebec benefited from harmonization at the time , there was no discussion about compensation .
now that the eastern provinces have followed the same path of harmonization at a loss of more than 5 % of their revenue , the provincial Liberals negotiated with the federal Liberals for a compensation of $ 1 billion total .
in retrospect Quebec thinks it should be compensated .
however it is not the only province that will not receive compensation upon harmonization .
Ontario will not , Alberta will not and also B.C. will not .
these provinces pay substantially to those provinces that are being compensated .
in 1993 the Liberal government verbally promised to eliminate , scrap and abolish the GST .
the Liberal red book itself was much more vague however .
the Liberal red book pledged " Give the all - party finance committee of the House of Commons a 12 - month mandate to consult fully with Canadians and provincial governments and to report on ways to achieve tax fairness , simplicity and harmonization .
in particular , the committee will be mandated to report on all options and alternatives to the current GST '' .
the Liberals led voters to believe that they would scrap the GST , not hide it in the price in three provinces which they have tried to do .
the Liberals used to think the GST was not visible enough .
as the former member of Acadie - Bathurst and Liberal finance critic once said " The whole idea of visibility was seen by many Canadians as being a deterrent to free spending governments which would just raise the tax , get the money it needs at election time for promises , spend it foolishly and then all of a sudden be in extremely difficult times '' .
even the Liberal MP for Kenora - Rainy River said " To keep the GST hidden from Canadians is despicable '' .
the Minister of Finance promised to do away with the tax and replace it with an alternative method of collecting moneys .
why has he not honoured these promises ?
because the GST is , in fact , a fair and equitable method of collecting tax for this country .
it was a well thought out plan on the part of the Tory government .
in April 1996 the federal government along with Nova Scotia , New Brunswick and Newfoundland agreed to harmonize their sales taxes and to bury them in the price .
it was no surprise that all governments involved were Liberals .
to entice the three provinces to participate , the Liberal government paid almost $ 1 billion in compensation according to negotiations struck .
this allowed the participating provinces to reduce their sales tax for a combined federal - provincial rate of 15 % .
however , they failed to realize , or maybe they did , that far more goods and services would now be taxed .
those living in the three Atlantic provinces have been hardest hit .
the HST attacks low and low middle income Canadians the most .
instead of paying only the GST , now they must pay the GST and HST , an increase of 8 % , on electricity , fuel , oil , food , children ' s clothing , gasoline , telephone , haircuts and school books .
those items that saw a decline in tax applied were those items high income Canadians can more often afford to purchase .
examples would be cars , stereos , home appliances and boats .
one billion dollars went from the pockets of taxpayers to the three maritime provinces to compensate them for lost revenues .
those provinces are receiving more than twice the money of their anticipated shortfall .
in total the three provinces would have a revenue shortfall of $ 395 million but in fact they are receiving total compensation of $ 971 million .
why was it necessary to overpay these provinces by more than $ 570 million ?
was this a good business decision or just an incentive to get the provinces to sign for a bad deal ?
all this money was paid up front .
however , the provinces may end up raising other taxes to make up the shortfall in future years .
we have heard from the provinces .
although the agreement was not announced until the 1996 - 97 fiscal year , and even though the payments are meant to cover a four - year period , Ottawa booked the entire amount to the 1995 - 96 fiscal year .
that lets Ottawa play a shell game with its deficit numbers .
the finance minister said he can do this because he said before the end of the 1995 - 96 fiscal year that he would seek such an agreement .
the auditor general has slammed this accounting trick .
the Liberal government has broken its promises over and over again .
the manner in which it harmonized the sales tax in the Atlantic provinces is evidence of this .
example , the Prime Minister in London just a couple weeks ago .
the harmonized sales tax does not even come close to matching the red book ' s fine print .
the GST is still here .
it is the three provinces which are replacing their sales tax , not Ottawa .
the red book promised a tax system that minimizes disruption to small businesses .
retailers make it quite clear that tax included pricing would have caused major disruptions .
businesses selling in these three provinces from elsewhere in Canada will be required to collect and remit both taxes .
no such burden will be faced by merchants in the three harmonized provinces when they sell to the rest of the country .
this is both another cost to business and yet another barrier to interprovincial trade .
we applaud our PC senators who were successful in amending the harmonized bill .
they were able to postpone tax included pricing until a time that provinces representing a majority of the population agreed .
tax included pricing in only three provinces would have driven up the cost of doing business .
as a result there would have been added costs for everything from national advertising to the cost of reticketing items that are normally shipped from elsewhere with the price already included .
in closing , allow me to quote the hon. member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot " The Liberals have done a patch - up job .
in the three Atlantic provinces the existing GST and the provincial sales tax are being replaced with a single tax , called HST .
they have done a patch - up job to meet their election objectives .
they have made a partisan patch - up job at public expense and at the taxpayers expense with the taxes paid to the federal government every year . "
Mr. Ren 茅 Laurin ( Joliette , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I listened carefully to the remarks of the hon. member for Markham , who seems to be blaming the government for not abolishing a tax that the Conservatives brought in when they were in power , that is , before the Liberals .
is the hon. member for Markham , who blames the Liberals for not keeping their promise and who recognizes that this tax has not been as beneficial for the Atlantic provinces as he could could have hoped , ready to adopt the motion which our party has put forward today ?
if the tax has not been good and if the Liberal government has not kept its promise , we suggest today to him that they have at least one opportunity to restore justice or to correct the unfairness created by this tax .
are the hon. member for Markham and his party ready to support the motion put forward today by the Bloc Quebecois ?
Mr. Jim Jones :
madam Speaker , I did not hear all of the question because I did not have my ear piece on for the translation .
i believe that my party supports the setting up of a panel to review this and will accept the decisions of the panel .
Mr. Jim Pankiw ( Saskatoon - Humboldt , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , the hon. member for Kamloops earlier this morning gave a very chilling account of the truth surrounding the GST and indicated what a regressive tax it is .
sounds preposterous doesn ' t it ?
the truth is we are just inches away .
we pay GST for getting our hair cut .
i cannot stop my hair from growing .
he very correctly indicated that it is a tax on low income people .
everybody has to get a hair cut .
everybody has to buy clothing and books for children .
he said if we did not have the tax that money would remain in the pockets of the people and the people would spend the money .
he should have finished that .
when you spend the money it stimulates the economy and it creates jobs .
that is the whole point .
the GST is a tax on jobs .
it is a tax on the economy .
that is why it is regressive .
furthermore it drives a massive underground economy .
i am going to do that for cash '' .
if the government would lower taxes , simplify the tax system and make it fair , people would not have an incentive to evade taxes .
furthermore , the GST is a massive burden on small business .
instead of contemplating ways to expand their business and improve the services they provide to their clients , the guy now has to hire somebody to do accounting to help the government collect its taxes .
then the government has a massive bureaucracy in Revenue Canada to collect it .
think of the downsizing we could do if we did not have to administer this ridiculous tax .
the compliance and administrative costs of operating the GST are extremely high .
why do we not have common sense and say " Let us scrap the GST and simplify our tax system '' .
it makes perfect sense .
why can the government not see that ?
Mr. Jim Jones :
madam Speaker , I do not know if I am to respond to that .
the GST has been politicized too much .
when it initially started out it was to replace the federal sales tax on manufactured goods which was 14 % .
maybe there are some items that should not be included .
we should look at the benefits the GST has accumulated to this country over the last few year .
companies are now more competitive because the hidden manufacturers ' tax is no longer there .
the tax is not included in goods that go out of the country .
the GST has not been all that bad for us .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I am very pleased to speak to the motion presented by my colleague from Mercier .
first , I would like to say a few words to Reform members .
i was listening to them lecturing us earlier and giving us advice on political correctness .
on April 23 , 1996 , the federal government concluded with three maritime provinces , namely Nova Scotia , Newfoundland and New Brunswick , an agreement harmonizing their provincial sales tax with the GST .
since the three provinces faced adjustment costs , the agreement provided they would receive in the following years a compensation worth close to $ 1 billion , $ 961 million to be precise .
how did the government come up with such a compensation for these three provinces ?
this is how it was calculated .
it is an important criteria to remember , and we will get back to it later when explaining why the province of Quebec is entitled to such a compensation .
what benefit was given to the three maritime provinces with an agreement on the harmonization of the GST and the provincial sales tax and $ 1 billion in compensation ?
that agreement gave them three benefits straight away .
the first one was the possibility to reduce sales tax by four percentage points .
that was a direct advantage for the consumers in the three Atlantic provinces concerned .
the second one was the possibility for businesses to have more competitive prices in these three provinces since the lowering of the sales tax rate allowed them to lower the price of their products .
the third one was a major added advantage for companies in the Atlantic provinces because , with the full harmonization of taxes , which has been completed since April 1 , they can claim a direct refund for all the taxes they pay on their inputs .
Quebec was not able to benefit from these three advantages .
Quebec , which harmonized its sales tax with the GST on its own in 1990 did not benefit from these three advantages that were provided for in the agreement between the federal government and the three Atlantic provinces .
that is why , in December of last year , Bernard Landry , the deputy premier of Quebec , minister of state for the economy and minister of finance , and Jacques Brassard , minister of intergovernmental affairs , demanded , on behalf of the Quebec government , compensation for the adjustment costs it incurred in 1990 and the costs it has been paying since then in terms of QST and GST harmonization .
based on a fair assessment of the costs incurred , Quebec is entitled to an estimated $ 2 billion in compensation .
the Minister of Finance told us , and the Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions repeated the same thing a few moments ago - there are a lot of parrots in that party - `` You are not entitled to this compensation because your provincial sales tax revenues have not gone down since the harmonization of the GST and the QST '' .
i will remind you of the criterion I was telling you about a few moments ago and which is included in the agreement between the three Atlantic provinces and the federal government , namely that the $ 1 billion compensation given to the Atlantic provinces is due to the fact that the harmonization of the provincial sales tax and the federal sales tax is causing them to lose over 5 % in PST revenues .
it has been claimed - and the Minister of Finance and the Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions understand this problem - by using a rationale that has been stretched to the limit , that we are not entitled to anything .
one must look at the whole tax base .
one must see if , for example , the harmonization of the tax has forced the Quebec government to make adjustments elsewhere in its tax structure that may have had a negative impact on the province ' s revenues .
one must do that .
one must look at all the facts in this matter .
by so doing , however , the difference between the old fuel and tobacco taxes and the new harmonized tax meant a loss to the Quebec government of $ 355 million .
this is the first example of data missing from the Minister of Finance ' s assessment , or rejected out of hand by him , because he does not want anything to do with an accurate overall assessment - and , what is more , he knows he is wrong .
the second major point that must be considered is the overall tax structure before and after harmonization of the GST and the provincial sales tax in Quebec .
people became aware that the cost of harmonizing the GST and the sales tax in Quebec meant that corporate tax rates had to be adjusted .
they had to be increased in order to raise supplementary revenues for Quebec to finance the harmonization of the GST and the TVQ .
i will give two examples .
the first , that the tax on profits was raised , from 6.33 % for businesses in general , to 8,9 % immediately after harmonization .
there is a link here with harmonization of the GST and TVQ , and the costs of that harmonization .
tax on capital was also raised , from 0.52 % to 0.64 % .
the third fundamental point is the one I made when I started to speak .
since Quebec was not compensated for harmonization of the GST and TVQ , we have not been able to fully harmonize our taxation system .
what that means in particular is that , normally , large Quebec corporations ought to be able to receive full reimbursement of business input taxes paid , these being intermediary products used in production of their end product for sale .
in the maritimes , with full harmonization , which has been in effect since April , businesses have a competitive edge over businesses in Quebec .
they are being reimbursed the taxes they pay on the purchase of the input used in the production of their final product .
the shortfall faced by big businesses in Quebec , which is tied directly to the lack of transition measures from the federal government to harmonize the GST and the QST - the Quebec sales tax - means a loss of $ 500 million for these businesses .
because there is no compensation , the Government of Quebec cannot reimburse the taxes paid on the input of the major firms .
when the Minister of Finance tabled his latest budget , the Quebec deputy premier and minister of state for the economy , Bernard Landry , showed clearly the link between the injustice faced by Quebec on the policy of harmonizing the GST and the QST and the fact that big business is not being reimbursed the taxes paid on input .
it is 10 % of the Quebec sales tax revenues .
i return to the criteria whose importance I stressed at the start of my speech .
we have a situation where the big businesses ' shortfall alone , in terms of a refund for the taxes paid on their inputs , totals $ 500 million or 10 % of the provincial sales tax .
the federal government must be consistent .
we are only asking that justice be done .
i will complete my presentation with a situation that could have occurred in 1990 .
at the time , Quebec could have looked at the various budget items , including direct and indirect taxes , and made other choices in terms of business and consumer taxes , etc. , and it could have ended up with a completely different tax structure than the current one .
for example , let us consider the direct sales tax revenues in comparison with the governments ' total revenues .
there are huge differences between Canadian provinces .
the ratio of sales tax revenues to the governments ' total revenues is 12.9 % for provincial governments in the maritimes .
in Ontario , it is 8.3 % , while in Quebec it is 8.6 % .
in 1990 , had Quebec known that the federal government would some day offer compensation for harmonizing taxes - something we did without compensation or support at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars - it could have said " There will be some form of compensation some day '' .
using the rule mentioned earlier , by which the finance minister decided that the government was to step in and give $ 1 billion to the maritimes in compensation after they experienced revenue losses from harmonization in excess of 5 % of their current sales tax revenue , we could have said " If that is how it will work , let us reduce personal income taxes , reduce business taxes and raise the provincial sales tax so that , when the federal government comes to us with its plans for harmonizing and asks us to reduce our tax rate , it will have to pay us compensation because we will have experienced a loss in excess of 5 % of our provincial sales tax revenue '' .
one cannot look at only part of the equation , decide that there were no losses and condemn Quebec to never getting any compensation for having made fiscal choices that were different from those in the past .
the maritime provinces depend heavily on sales taxes - they account for nearly 13 % of their overall revenue , as someone said - and because they made that choice , they are entitled to $ 1 billion in compensation .
we went along with the federal government ' s proposal .
so we are not interested in hearing that we are being difficult .
what is even more offensive is that $ 250 million of the compensation being paid the maritimes is coming from Quebec taxpayers .
not only are we not getting $ 2 billion in compensation , and there are actual figures to support this calculation , but as Quebeckers we are also being forced to pay $ 250 million to harmonize a tax in the Atlantic provinces so that businesses in those provinces can be more competitive than businesses in Quebec , can cut in on our markets , take away our jobs , and all with our help .
you can see what a ridiculous and unfair situation Quebec is in .
we are not calling for a debate for the sheer pleasure of it .
there must be no confusing apples with oranges , dragging constitutional arguments into a serious fiscal matter , as our colleague , the secretary of state for international financial institutions did just now . He often says the first thing that comes into his head , but this time he was out of line .
what we are calling for in our motion is something quite simple .
we have figures and arguments .
we think they are the best arguments .
we think we have a strong case .
we think we have been treated unfairly in this matter , and we are not the only ones who think so , because our view is also shared by the premiers of all Canadian provinces .
last year , at the economic summit in Quebec City , this was the unanimous view .
all these people cannot be wrong .
but we are prepared to play by the rules and take this approach .
the Minister of Finance tells us " You are not entitled to compensation '' .
maybe our case is not as strong as all that .
but this is our proposal , the proposal that our leader , the member for Laurier - Sainte - Marie , outlined during the election campaign , and it is an ingenious proposal that could resolve this deadlock .
its result could be that we would no longer rise every week in this House to ask the Minister of Finance for $ 2 billion , and he would no longer tell us we have no right to such an amount .
this is a useless debate .
what we propose is that three experts be appointed - the first by the Minister of Finance , the second by the Government of Quebec , and the third jointly by the first two - to review the whole issue and analyze all of the basic data involved .
we are ready to accept the conclusion .
but if the Minister of Finance rejects our proposal , it is because he has something to hide , because he recognizes his vulnerability , because he is scared to compare the technical arguments of the Bloc Quebecois and the Government of Quebec with his own technical arguments .
if he rejects our proposal , it is because he knows very well that following an objective analysis , a serious assessment like the one we outlined this morning , he will realize that he owes money to Quebec . He will realize that he made a mistake .
he will realize that he owes Quebec $ 2 billion , $ 1.9 million to be exact , for harmonizing the GST with its provincial sales tax .
we are humbly reaching out to the federal government so that this deadlock can be resolved and so that we can go forward .
as I pointed out , we are willing to accept the conclusion of the three experts .
government members ought to take this issue more seriously , to be fair to Quebec , to show some intellectual honesty , because over the last year and a half , I have seen this debate degenerate into demagoguery .
all that is left to do is to settle the account .
hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as everyone knows , harmonization presents many advantages for small and medium size businesses ; there is only one tax , one base , one document and one administration .
furthermore , one of the major advantages is for companies , small and medium size businesses and large corporations which must all stay competitive in the business world .
even premier McKenna said his increased competitiveness , compared to provinces which had not yet harmonized , would highly benefit corporations .
we know that Canadian corporations now pay more than $ 5 billion each year in provincial tax on inputs and the best way to avoid that is GST harmonization or , in other words , a value added tax .
that being said , according to the hon. member who just spoke Quebec corporations stated they were not benefiting from the credit on inputs .
they cannot get a refund for the provincial tax paid on inputs .
this is not our fault , the problem lies with the Quebec government which is not reimbursing all of the provincial tax paid by large corporations in Quebec .
it is their problem .
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
Mr. Speaker , I told you the member did not make any sense , he has just proven me right .
the maritime provinces have been able to do it since April 1 st because the federal government gave them $ 961 million for that .
in Quebec , we went ahead with harmonization , without any federal support .
but we cannot do it , we cannot afford to do it because the federal government has been and continues to be unfair with Quebec .
harmonizing both taxes is a good thing .
we believe it is .
we support efficiency , and the federal government knows it .
but it wants to draw a red herring across the trail .
we are competing in particular with New Brunswick businesses which enjoy a $ 400 million rebate linked to the billion dollar in compensation the federal government is giving three maritime provinces .
you talked about Frank McKenna and rightly so .
frank McKenna tried to steal our own businesses .
this is what the federal government calls a fair system .
wait a minute .
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris - Moose Mountain , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , maybe it is a good time to make a comment and then ask a question of both my colleagues on the government side and in the Bloc .
i listened this morning to the debate about taxes and fairness .
it reminded me of the old clich 茅 which says there is nothing surer than taxes and death .
i had this come home to me the other day .
when I got the bill , the thing which reminded me of the clich 茅 was that I had to pay the taxes .
these people were even taxed in death .
Canadians are used to taxes .
i have a comment for the government minister and the member of the Bloc .
approximately five years ago because of the illegal importation of cigarettes into Canada the federal government removed most of the federal tax in Ontario and in Quebec .
it was a federal tax but it was not removed in western Canada .
smokers out there had to pay the full shot .
would either of these members say that maybe Saskatchewan smokers should be reimbursed because they had to pay all the cigarette taxes when over half the smokers in other parts of Canada did not have to pay them ?
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
Mr. Speaker , I have a short comment regarding what was said by the hon. member from the Reform Party .
clearly , in a ideal world nobody would pay any tax .
but , I would like to bring him back to earth .
we do not live in an ideal world and there are taxes to be paid .
unfortunately , we have to live with that .
as you said , even death is taxed .
it will take a while before that changes .
hon. Jim Peterson :
Mr. Speaker , I must agree with the hon. member from Quebec who just said that in an ideal world things would be different .
in an ideal world nobody would smoke .
this being said , I would like to add two things to his comments .
true , the Government of Quebec does not give rebates to companies for their input taxes , which amount to $ 500 million , but this is the fault of the Government of Quebec and an indication -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot .
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
Mr. Speaker , I can only answer that I will get back on track , because occasionally we have to return to serious matters .
the secretary of state had a good laugh , but it is time to get back to serious business .
our proposal is to submit all the data to an arbitration panel independent from the government , independent from the Bloc , independent from the Government of Quebec , for a full evaluation .
we believe that this is really unfair .
all we are saying is that Quebec should be treated fairly in tax matters , in money matters .
this should not be too hard to understand .
let us try this formula : three independent experts to study the question instead of relying on whatever members opposite have to say .
we are getting a bit tired of arguing over numbers and of not making any headway in this matter after a year and three months .
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am hoping after having heard the first round of debate that we can restore some clarity and context to the whole issue of the harmonized sales tax and specifically the motion before us that deals with compensation .
in order to do that I want to go back a step and focus on the early part of our mandate when the government asked the House of Commons finance committee to consider alternatives to the GST and to essentially consult broadly with Canadians on some alternatives .
the committee heard from tax experts , business people and Canadians .
in fact the committee heard from nearly 500 witnesses and received over 700 briefs .
it reviewed about 20 different alternatives and found that the broadest consensus by far was in favour of harmonization , replacing the current patchwork of sales tax with a single tax based on a value added system .
as you will remember , Mr. Speaker , because you were here in the last Parliament , this really became the foundation of the HST , the harmonized sales tax .
it was an agreement between the federal government and three Atlantic provinces , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia and Newfoundland .
throughout this agreement which came into effect last April these provinces replaced a system which was in fact quite cumbersome , costly and complicated with one that proved to be simpler and essentially more efficient .
most important , these changes will add up to a better system that promotes a stronger economy and will result in greater job creation .
consumers in participating provinces are benefiting in a number of important ways .
most important , there has been a reduction in the rate of tax .
for Nova Scotia and for New Brunswick the combined rate of 15 % represents a decrease of essentially 4 percentage points in an effective sales tax rate .
in Newfoundland and Labrador the rate decrease is closer to 5 % .
we heard a lot about businesses this morning in the first round .
businesses are also benefiting from the lower combined tax rate .
they now have to deal with only one set of tax forms , one set of rules and one tax administration .
essentially it means lower compliance costs , and we know that translates into savings and those savings translate into the firm ' s own bottom line and can benefit consumers .
the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants estimated that if all provinces were to join in the national sales tax system Canadian business could save between $ 400 million and $ 700 million a year in administrative costs alone .
i should also point out that a someone who has been part of the small business community , and Mr. Speaker , you are also part of the business community , the benefits of lower compliance costs will particularly be advantageous for the small business community .
we know that the small business community also bears disproportionately the cost of dealing with two separate tax systems .
a further benefit to businesses in the participating provinces will be the recovery of the HST payable on inputs , something that was not being done before the implementation of the HST .
in fact , harmonization will eliminate over $ 700 million in hidden sales taxes on business inputs in the three Atlantic provinces .
this will in fact reduce the cost of Atlantic exports and essentially eliminate the unintentional competitive advantages that imports currently enjoy in the Atlantic provinces .
the HST adds up essentially to a simpler , fairer system and really a stronger economy .
let me now turn to what is really the aspect of this legislation that has too often been attacked , including today ' s motion , and essentially attacked by those who placed partisan politics and narrow regionalism ahead of clear objective thought .
this of course is the decision by the government to provide a formula for short term adjustment assistance to provinces when they face significant structural costs to participate in a new and integrated system .
it will end after four years .
it is not an ongoing program which some of the members have alluded to in this House as being a subsidy .
it will end after four years and it provides provinces with sufficient time to adjust to a harmonized system .
it is also important to note that it is truly a joint program .
under the formula there is near equal sharing between the federal government and qualifying provinces of the adjustment costs that harmonization would entail over a four year period , but what I find disappointing is that there are some Canadians who have attacked the entire concept of adjustment assistance .
this mindset essentially ignores history .
it misreads the present and quite frankly it lacks the vision for the future .
Canadian history makes it very clear that government has played an essential role in our economic evolution and adjustment .
there were tax and land grant support for a national rail system , the development of the St. Lawrence seaway , megaprojects from Lloydminster to Hibernia , special tax concessions for oil and gas development , for research and development , and for small business .
i could go on and on .
the list is long and quite honourable .
these government investments respond to opportunities .
there is a long and proud list of federal assistance for sectors and regions that face economic difficulties and dislocations or must in fact confront some core structural change .
equalization payments are an essential part of our constitutional framework .
they recognize that all of Canada is stronger as a society and as a marketplace when we help less affluent provinces to provide a basic level of public service and support .
perhaps some members are not aware of this , but back in 1972 , when the federal government instituted income tax reform , every single province received adjustment assistance totalling more than $ 2.7 billion over a seven year period .
more recently the federal government provided assistance to farmers following the collapse of world grain prices .
now they are being compensated for the elimination of the Crow rate .
we have provided bottom line support for maritime fishers who were confronted by a tragedy of decimated fish stocks .
we equally shared in the cost of solving the problem of tobacco smuggling in Ontario and Quebec .
these actions were not charity .
they were not partisan politics .
they were essentially a reflection of the contract Canadians have struck with themselves , a nation building contract which says that there is a critical role for government and that critical role is to help when help is truly needed and where it can in fact be truly effective .
that takes me to the present .
today more than ever we must manage assistance with much more rigour , innovation and insight .
the world of global competition for trade , investment , business opportunities and jobs demands that government remain constantly conscience of the bottom line .
we all know that a government which squanders resources imposes on the nation the costs of high deficits , high taxes and even higher interest rates .
these we all know are job killers and investment killers .
more important , they are future killers and they are hope destroyers .
this same challenging competitive environment also demands that government continue to play a role in helping its citizens , sectors and regions to meet the global challenge .
that is exactly what we are doing with the adjustment assistance for the sales tax harmonization .
assistance is a necessary investment in making Canada stronger , through helping disadvantaged regions move to a modern tax system to meet the modern challenges of today .
it is a 21 st century type of investment .
it reflects the fact that government must change how it involves itself in economic development .
any province in the country which faces a transitional revenue loss exceeding 5 % because of harmonization qualifies for assistance .
i cannot make it much clearer than that .
it is pretty straightforward .
after four years it is on its own .
it is a transitional measure .
that means that British Columbia , Alberta and Ontario would not meet the threshold .
they will not lose money on harmonization , just like Quebec did not lose any money when it partially harmonized .
let us go directly to the heart of today ' s motion by the Bloc .
that means that there are no grounds for its claim that it is being shortchanged .
let us go with the facts .
after beginning its phased in harmonization in 1991 - 92 and 1992 - 93 , Quebec sales tax revenues were 20 % and 17 % higher in each fiscal year , respectively .
these figures are not based on my documents .
they are not based on the documents of the national government .
they are based on Quebec documents .
it is a fact that annual Quebec sales tax revenues over the 1990 - 91 to 1995 - 96 fiscal years were on average 12 % higher than the province ' s preharmonization revenue in 1989 - 90 .
i can go further .
it is a fact that when we draw the analogy with the other provinces over that same period , Ontario with a retail tax system similar to the one Quebec replaced had an average annual sales tax revenue drop of 3 % below 1989 - 90 levels .
in other words , when you make the comparison of where Quebec was with harmonization , the improvement we saw in Quebec , and look in that same period at the experience of Ontario , which has a similar retail sales tax system , we see that harmonization was a winner for Quebec .
let me again be very clear .
full harmonization with the GST means that you have the same tax base , the same rate and that members of the HST , provinces and the national government , would move in concert if we see a rise in rates , a reduction in rates or an expansion of the tax base .
the second point is that the revenue loss because of harmonization be significant .
Quebec ' s revenues went up after harmonization .
the other point that was brought forward this morning by an hon. member from the Bloc was that the premiers across this country supported Mr. Bouchard when he said they are entitled to $ 2 billion of compensation .
that was the message from St. Andrews .
let me clarify what the premiers said in St. Andrews .
what they said is that all provinces should be treated equally .
Quebec in this instance has been treated like all other provinces that do not suffer a decrease in revenue due to harmonization .
let us talk about who would have qualified for compensation under the HST in 1996 since the emphasis has been on the Atlantic provinces and that the deal was made with the Atlantic provinces , and solely with the Atlantic provinces .
under the formula Manitoba would have qualified for compensation in 1996 had it decided to participate in the harmonized sales tax .
Saskatchewan would have qualified in 1996 for compensation under this formula had it decided to participate in the HST .
the last time I checked Mr. Romanow was still the premier of Saskatchewan , the leader of the New Democratic Party .
it is not a deal that was struck solely because we have a number of Liberal governments in the Atlantic provinces .
the Atlantic provinces saw merit in participating in the harmonized sales tax .
they recognized the efficiency it would provide for their business community and the fact that it would make them more competitive and improve their exports .
let me go to another fact .
a comment was made earlier about the fact that because Quebec did not receive compensation for this harmonization it was forced to increase corporate tax rates to make up for that compensation .
i cannot make it any clearer than that .
harmonization occurred and revenues went up .
if there were any increase in tax rates for corporations in Quebec it was solely because of the decision made by the Quebec government at the time .
it had nothing to do with whether or not Quebec qualified for compensation .
any linkage to that is truly false .
for the three Atlantic provinces , with their less developed economies and such problems as fish stocks , harmonization carries a painful interim cost .
there is no denying that .
it is surprising and quite frankly frustrating that our approach has been turned into a political football .
there is tragic cynicism at work here , the type of cynicism that always knows the price of everything but the value of nothing .
who can argue with the value of helping provinces to provide the environment to industry to help it thrive , not just one sector or two sectors but all businesses in the region ?
it is particularly true for the Atlantic region , which is why it has moved to accept the harmonized approach .
by what illogical leap can it be suggested that because some provinces qualify for assistance it should then be provided to every province , even to those who will not suffer major losses ?
i will return to my example of 1971 when changes were made to the income tax system and every province received compensation because they were adversely affected .
that was not a prescription .
it is a comment we cannot agree with .
since I only have a couple of minutes left , let me close by saying that I reject the competing point of view so often expressed by the Bloc and in effect by the official opposition that opposes any compensation .
it ignores the obligation framed by 130 years of Canadian history to help disadvantaged regions become equal partners in a strong , vibrant and growing country .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I heard so many strange things in that speech that I hardly know where to begin to set the record straight .
that is what he is doing now .
we must consider all the basic data , the overall data in the case and see what happened before and after the harmonization at all tax levels .
this was demonstrated to him earlier .
the member should ask his finance minister .
what is he afraid of ?
what does he fear if his case is so strong ?
he should submit this case to the committee of experts .
i want to make a last brief comment .
he referred to a former finance minister ; I know he referred to Mr. Bourbeau .
so this is no reference .
Mr. Tony Valeri :
Mr. Speaker , once again the manipulation of information is becoming an art form .
more specifically , any province with a loss exceeding 5 % because of harmonization would qualify for assistance .
Quebec revenues went up after harmonization .
if they were to harmonize they would not qualify just as Quebec does not qualify given that they are partially harmonized and not fully harmonized .
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , having listened to the hon. member ' s comments I do not know where to start .
because of time restraints in the House it is obvious we will not have time to meet all the concerns raised by the hon. member .
i have a couple of questions .
he spoke about the foundation of the HST .
the hon. member made a lot of suggestions about partisan politics .
we listened to a certain amount of Liberal propaganda .
does the hon. member understand how on a workhorse the reins go up through the hames and attach to the horse ?
does he understand the commands gee and haw or droite and gauche ?
does he understand why those commands are given , that they are given to a horse because it is wearing a set of blinders ?
therefore the horse listens to the commands .
if the blinders are taken off the commands do not seem quite as specific .
the tax is not revenue neutral .
it gathers more tax than the two combined taxes used to gather .
what is the government prepared to do about that ?
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
before the hon. parliamentary secretary has a chance to respond , I remind hon. members to address each other through the Chair .
Mr. Tony Valeri :
i will put those comments aside and try to deal with the facts .
if the hon. member is saying that in Atlantic Canada the provinces are earning more revenue now that the taxes are harmonized , compared to prior to the harmonization , the Atlantic provinces would not qualify for compensation .
his statement is incorrect .
the provinces Atlantic Canada because of harmonization are earning less government revenues .
if the member is saying that Atlantic provinces are earning more money today because of harmonization than they were prior to harmonization , that is incorrect .
that is why they are receiving assistance .
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I heard some comments from the hon. member opposite that I liked and that surprised me .
he said that high taxes were killing jobs .
it was great to hear that from across the House .
we have been saying that for a long time and we know it .
the small businesses I have talked to complained about filling out one set of tax forms .
if it is taken from two to one , what is the difference ?
they still resent having to be a tax collector for the government .
when they had meetings a consensus was brought to bear that businesses wanted a harmonized tax system .
was a question put to them on whether they wanted a tax at all ?
was that ever raised ?
they were to have harmonized taxes .
did they want two taxes or one tax ?
what do we do about the GST which the government promised to get rid of but is still in place ?
it is coming out of the pockets of families and businesses .
the emphasis should be on putting the money back .
you have commented on the consensus and I want you to elaborate on that -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
i remind hon. members , once again , that we must address our comments to one another through the Chair .
it tends to keep the level of debate more controllable .
Mr. Tony Valeri :
Mr. Speaker , I will respond to a number of the points made .
i thank the hon. member for the question and for his comment that he agrees with a number of things I have said .
on the actual forms that need to be completed with respect to the GST or harmonized sales tax , there is no question I did a fair amount of work on the small business sector in the House during the last session .
regulatory burden and compliance burden were big issues for the small business community .
as a result one form was eliminated by those provinces that harmonized , which provided for some reduction in the burden of compliance .
as well , I believe it was announced recently by the revenue minister that there would be a reduction in the period of time small businesses would have to remit sales taxes to the federal government .
if they are earning less than $ 30,000 they are exempt .
over that amount they can now go to a quarterly period rather than having to remit it on a monthly basis .
again this speaks to the reduction in the burden of compliance .
with respect to the pressures in terms of axes there is no question that as the finance committee went across the country taxes were an issue that spoke to the competitiveness of the country .
the finance minister has said over and over again that when the government and the country can afford to provide substantial and sustainable tax relief to Canadians they are committed to doing it .
at the initial stage a very targeted tax relief will be provided for those most in need .
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini 猫 re , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the motion moved by my party today shows once more that the Liberal government continues to deal with Quebec on a different basis .
despite repeated demands from the Quebec government , it systematically refuses to grant any compensation for tax harmonization in Quebec .
its repeated rejections of legitimate Quebec demands have been condemned time and again by Bloc Quebecois members and the Quebec finance minister , Bernard Landry , who has to deal with a $ 2 billion shortfall .
in a similar situation , maritime provinces received $ 1 billion .
thanks to that money , the governments in these provinces , especially New Brunswick , are now better able to compete with the other provinces and with Quebec .
by acting this way , the Liberal government , even when it tries , through its federalist propaganda , to sell the merits of the best country in the world , is clearly trampling all over Quebec by hiding behind the smoke screen of a financial model that results in inaccurate calculations by the finance minister .
whatever financial method the finance minister is using , we know how he views the province of Quebec , a unique province that , since 1993 , has been hit by drastic cuts , the sole purpose of which is to discredit the Quebec government .
had it not been for the tactics of the Liberal government , the Government of Quebec would have already presented a balanced budget to the people of Quebec .
the Minister of Finance is hard - headed , or he seems to have problems understanding our arguments .
Quebec businesses bore the financial costs of this reform .
last May , in his speech , the Quebec Finance Minister reminded us that on April 26 , 1996 , the Liberal federal government announced with great fanfare the signature of memorandums of understanding with three Atlantic provinces , whereby their respective sales taxes would be harmonized , effective April 1 , 1997 , at a combined rate of 15 % .
the reason for this decision by the federal government , according to the Minister of Finance , was to compensate the financial losses borne by these three provinces .
at the same time , he announced an adjustment assistance program whereby close to $ 1 billion , that is $ 423 per capita , would be paid as compensation .
but nothing for Quebec , as the federal government showed once again that it could not be fair to Quebeckers .
when he tabled his budget in the National Assembly , the Quebec Minister of Finance strongly condemned this action by the Liberal government .
i would like to quote Minister Bernard Landry :
because of the federal government ' s financial assistance , they can make their tax system more competitive , without having to increase their other taxes and without reducing input tax credits for businesses in order to finance the cost of harmonization with the GST .
after many requests and months of waiting , Quebec finally received from the federal government , in August 1996 , the detailed results of its analytical grid used to review Quebec ' s request .
we are attempting again today to bring the federal Finance Minister to admit that his calculations are incorrect .
i will quote again Minister Bernard Landry :
by considering only the sales tax revenues of the provinces that have opted to harmonize with the GST and not the complete tax burden , the adjustment assistance program fails to consider the provinces ' global tax policy .
in this way , this program unduly benefits the Atlantic provinces , which have the highest sales taxes in Canada .
this is what their renewed federalism , their more flexible federalism , is all about , complete with the homeland of the French language and , more recently , the unique character of Quebec and Quebeckers which nine other Canadian provinces now want to recognize .
this is how the federal government wants to define the unique character of Quebec .
i do not want to fight over figures , but let us take the time to see how the Liberal government behaves in its dealings with Quebec .
the conflict between Quebec and Ottawa arises from the fact that compensation is calculated based upon an economic model and some kind of simulation .
the federal government has tried to estimate the amount to the losses the Atlantic provinces and Quebec will incur during the four years following the harmonization .
this simulation is applied to all provinces and only takes into consideration the sales tax revenues .
by using only the sales tax revenues instead of the total provincial tax base to determine if the provinces deserve any compensation , Ottawa is treating the provinces and Quebec in the most unfair way possible .
it is obvious that the federal Minister of Finance is unjustly penalizing the provinces for their previous fiscal choices .
indeed , eligibility for federal compensation depends on the way the provinces choose to structure their taxes .
the more a province relies on sales tax to generate revenues , the more a change in that tax rate is likely to produce major revenue losses , and the more that province is likely to receive federal compensation .
the adjustment assistance program is arbitrary since it does not take into account the fiscal realities in the different provinces and in Quebec nor their actual financial capacity to harmonize their sales tax .
the compensation requested by the Government of Quebec is very reasonable .
i remind you that the compensation paid to the Atlantic provinces equals almost $ 1 billion , which represents an average of $ 423 per inhabitant while the compensation demanded by Quebec represents $ 273 per inhabitant .
i sometimes wonder if the minister still remembers that rule .
with all his empty answers , we come to question how serious he is .
when we know that there was a 60 % gap last year between his estimates and the actual deficit , we can easily see why he cannot really understand Quebec ' s situation .
i wish to take this opportunity to say that the political decisions of the Liberal government since it took office in 1993 are being criticized throughout Canada and Quebec . Poverty is on the increase , students are in debt and have no jobs , the EI reform is unfair to everyone , and social and health services have been hard hit .
and the Liberal government dares to talk about a humane approach to finance .
enough is enough .
in the riding of Lotbini 猫 re in Quebec , businesses would put this $ 2 billion to extremely good use by becoming more competitive on Canadian , North American and international markets .
the Minister of Finance knows this , and that is why he is refusing to pay .
once again , he sits tight and Quebec pays .
why ?
because we are unique .
there are many examples of the Liberal government ' s bad faith .
their centralizing tactics pervade their every action .
the throne speech was very revealing in this regard , and the recent moves by the Minister of Health , as well as those by the Minister of Human Resources Development , with his youth strategy , represent serious interference in provincial jurisdiction .
it is all a numbers game .
the federal government seems to have trouble understanding what Quebec is going through .
as for the GST harmonization , in light of the actions of the present Liberal government , we have a very good suggestion .
it was announced by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois , Gilles Duceppe , during the last election campaign .
at that time , Mr. Duceppe suggested to the Liberal government that an independent arbitration panel be created to resolve the impasse , which is very harmful to Quebec ' s economy .
Quebec ' s Deputy Premier and Minister of Finance is prepared to challenge the federal finance minister ' s figures .
the repeated refusals by the federal minister say a lot about the weakness of his government ' s arguments .
if the minister is so sure he is right , why is he hiding behind a series of vague and inexplicable refusals ?
this is why all members of the House must vote in favour of this motion that could , once and for all , shed light on this shady business by the federal finance minister , who continues to shirk his responsibilities in this debate .
in conclusion , the behaviour of the Liberal government merely strengthens the argument that the only real solution to all Quebec ' s economic problems lies in sovereignty .
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I think it is all very clear .
the Bloc wants compensation for the GST for reasons that are not valid .
it must be remembered that the Premier of Quebec is the former leader of the Bloc Quebecois .
when Mr. Bouchard was leader of the official opposition , he argued in favour of sovereignty .
then there was the referendum .
now , Mr. Bouchard is Premier of Quebec and has to deal with an unhealthy economy in that province .
unemployment is high , there are problems in the business sector , and Mr. Bouchard has made major cuts .
i think Mr. Bouchard is looking to get money from the rest of Canada to pay for the cuts he made .
Mr. Loubier :
it is our tax money .
Mr. John Bryden :
Mr. Speaker , that is true .
it is very simple .
i have a question for the member .
is it true that Mr. Bouchard is still the real leader of the Bloc and it is he who is leading the attack against the government on this subject ?
Mr. Odina Desrochers :
Mr. Speaker , the 44 members of the Bloc Quebecois are mature men and women who do not need the founder of their party to hold them by the hand .
it is very simple .
we could talk about financial arguments , financial models , figures , billions and percentages , but the members opposite do not understand .
yesterday , the Minister of Health was saying that things were clogged up .
i have the impression that , on the issue of compensation for the GST , the members opposite are pretty clogged up .
they have great difficulty understanding what they are being told .
an hon. member :
their ears are blocked up .
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini 猫 re , BQ ) :
in order to resolve this , we in the Bloc Quebecois have a revolutionary suggestion to make , an equitable suggestion , as follows :
appoint a representative of your government . We in the Bloc Quebecois will receive the Quebec representative and then these two will select a third person , and the three will see who is right .
but I am convinced Quebec is the one that is right .

allotted DAY - GOODS AND SERVICES TAX
the House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment .
hon. Martin Cauchon ( Secretary of State ( Federal Office of Regional Development - Quebec ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak on this motion by my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois .
once again , however , allow me to point out the extent to which the people on the other side of the House are looking down the wrong end of the telescope or are failing to look at the other side of the coin .
the motion of the member for Mercier says , among other things :
that this House condemn the government for blatant unfairness to Quebec in the matter of the GST , the government having denied it compensation -
if ever a party failed to look at things objectively , if ever a party had the bad and annoying habit of acting and interacting only out of political interest , this is it and here it is doing it again in the motion by the hon. member for Mercier .
i might point out in passing that this approach does not serve the interests of the people they should be representing .
on the subject of the famous GST , it must be understood that its harmonization benefited Quebec as a whole .
it must also be understood that , since harmonization in 1991 , tax revenues have risen - and I have the figures here - from $ 5.11 billion in 1989 - 90 to $ 6.15 billion in 1991 - 92 .
it intervened realistically .
it also honoured the needs and the realities of each province when it intervened .
my colleague tells me that my work is rather well received by the Bloc members .
thank you very much .
when there is talk of economic development , to paraphrase what the Bloc members have just said , I think that indeed the Canadian government is doing a respectable job , a job that meets expectations and requirements .
let us look at the figures .
Quebec businesses receive 40 % of tax credits for research and development .
i see that my colleagues are taking notes on this , so they must not have realized that .
these figures are to the advantage of Quebec but there has been an attempt to conceal them .
Quebec businesses receive 33.5 % of direct federal assistance for R & D and to date - an important point - 57 % of investments under the technology partnerships Canada program were paid to companies in the province of Quebec .
speaking of that contribution , what is involved is financial contributions for administration of the tax , an amount that has hovered around $ 100 million yearly since 1992 - 93 .
i mentioned economic development earlier .
the Canadian government is active in quite a few areas in Quebec , but if we focus only on economic development , I believe that once again , Quebec comes out a winner .
indeed , once again , Quebec is dealt with very fairly and equitably .
we in the Canadian government are committed to dealing with the province of Quebec equitably and , first and foremost , to ensuring that the development of the province ' s economy can continue .
when I talk about helping and assisting Quebec , seeing that the province can develop further at the economic level , you will have guessed that I am referring to the federal office for regional development .
at present , the work the federal office is doing in the province of Quebec is much appreciated by all stakeholders that we work with and are in contact with on a daily basis .
our vision of economic development is one of respect , a vision that sticks to realities and needs .
this is therefore a vision , which , like Canadian federalism , changes as needs change over time .
right now , our vision has to change , as the economy is changing .
we are at the crossroads between two types of economy .
all players in the economic field have to start rethinking their way of doing things .
the same goes , naturally , for private sector businesses , which now have to carve out specialized niches for themselves , better target their markets , seize every opportunity to increase their competitiveness and adjust to globalization .
and what goes for many players in terms of economic development also goes for the Canadian government .
that is why , to take appropriate action in Quebec , we also introduced a change in our programming .
this all began in 1995 .
we consulted everyone , we consulted the business community , and the message was clear .
people wanted us to revamp all our programming .
they wanted us to be more in touch with the community and to reduce paperwork to a strict minimum .
above all , and this is the important point , people wanted us to make sure that the government was in a position to help businesses make the transition to the 21 st century by adjusting to the new phenomenon of globalization .
the federal office of regional development understood the message and we took action , with a view to continuing to be able to give Quebec its fair share , but also to continuing to deliver all the services of the Canadian government to the public .
so we are essentially talking about economic development in sectors of the new economy .
but we also developed tools for helping in special contexts , tools that give us maximum flexibility to meet these needs .
here are some examples of this flexibility .
members will recall the problem of the dwindling groundfish stocks in Atlantic Canada .
the federal office implemented the well known Coastal Quebec program , a program I had occasion to report on not so very long ago .
the Coastal Quebec program was another example of a flexible government able to react in terms of needs as well as local urgency .
there is another example of action that is appropriate and that corresponds to the situation .
you will have guessed that I am referring to the unfortunate events in Saguenay - Lac - Saint - Jean in July 1996 .
we intervened , along with all the other federal departments that were called in .
we left partisan politics behind , something the Bloc is incapable of doing .
Mr. Michel Guimond :
tell us about the GST .
Mrs. Francine Lalonde :
this is why you are not inviting us .
hon. Martin Cauchon :
you see , they are yelling .
they are incapable of rising to a level where , together , we could discuss the real needs of communities .
every time these people are involved in a issue , they get into partisan politics , and this is the major difference .
actually , there are a number of differences and one of them is the ability of Quebec members sitting on this side to serve Quebec well , to care about its development and its population , in a positive context , in the context of the current federal system which - and I can already hear some grumbling from the other side - is evolving , which has proven to be flexible in the past , and which will continue to do so .
as regards the program we put in place in the Saguenay - Lac - Saint - Jean region , we worked in partnership - as we on this side of the House know how to do it - with the public ' s interests in mind .
this is yet another good example of co - operation .
what a great program that has demonstrated its value locally for close to 20 years .
what a great program that is aligned to fit in with local realities and that was ultimately designed to help us continue to serve not only well , but also better , the needs of the business community in the province of Quebec .
of course , within the community development program , there are also , tied with all this , the community futures development corporations .
there are 54 such corporations across the province .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
in Abitibi .
hon. Martin Cauchon :
they are in Abitibi also , as my colleague just mentioned .
they offer investment funds , and in addition to everything else , they have an extraordinary team that people have access to , a team that knows what economic development is and that has a lot of experience .
when we speak of community futures development corporations , we speak basically of a team that has $ 82 million in assets .
annual investments in Quebec by CFDCs - and this is important when people talk about having a fair share , the numbers are there - are in the order of $ 23 million .
so we can see that these people are active locally .
these people carry out business with the local community .
in fact , speaking of being active locally and of conducting business , we have developed recently - the Government of Canada in partnership with CFDCs - programs allowing to better focus on the needs of regions in Quebec .
let me just mention the CFDCs youth initiative .
this is basically a grants program with a budget of $ 6 million that is intended for young people up to age of 34 inclusively .
the beauty of this program is that it was structured and designed by the CFDCs in co - operation with the federal office of regional development , to enable us to respond to the needs of young people in Quebec .
so this youth initiative is designed to keep young people in the regions and also to help them build their own businesses .
another area we have developed , in addition to involvement in the community , is a new vision of economic development .
this is essential because of globalization .
i often hear other governments and even critics opposite speak about economic development and I notice that these people , when they succeed in forgetting party lines and when they deal with a particular issue , often base their premises on ideas from the past .
i have two minutes left .
we must be capable of networking , not only on a national basis , but also on an international basis .
this is a positive vision that can help Quebec .
in closing , when we speak of fair shares , I think you have proof in the few words I have just spoken that not only has Quebec received fair treatment as far as the GST is concerned , but when we look more specifically at the question of economic development , there again you have an example that speaks volumes about the services the Canadian government can render and the assistance the Canadian government already renders to all regions , all entrepreneurs .
the purpose of so doing is , of course , to serve .
Mr. Ghislain Lebel ( Chambly , BQ ) :
the minister has just accused us of partisan politics .
this morning , I heard a western MP accusing the government of having bribed , bought off the people of the maritimes with this $ 920 million supposedly given to the maritimes to harmonize their tax with the GST , because the shortfall was over 5 % .
when a government , which alone knows the date the next election is to be called , goes around waving $ 960 million for fishers hard hit by the employment insurance reform , might we not assume that it is trying to bribe the public ?
fortunately , this sort of tactic does not work particularly well .
i would ask the members of the party in power who come from the maritimes to rise and speak to the topic of the day .
i invite them to do so .
we would like to hear what they have to say on the subject .
when the minister responsible for regional development tells us that this subsidy was awarded totally fairly , I would to know where he is getting his information from .
what is this 5 % based on , if it is not arbitrary ?
where does the figure 5 come from and how can he justify it ?
this is his sort of reasoning .
i would like him to tell us what justification there is for 5 % .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
before the hon. parliamentary secretary has a chance to respond I would ask the House to be careful throwing around terms like " bribe '' .
i was not here this morning .
i do not know if the term was imputed to a specific individual that it would be proper .
it happened earlier today , so let us not use that kind of word at least when this Speaker is in the chair .
hon. Martin Cauchon :
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. parliamentary secretary is a very skilled orator and I am sure we all appreciate it .
thank you .
hon. Martin Cauchon :
Mr. Speaker , listening to my hon. colleague ' s remarks brought to mind this old proverb I used to hear as a child .
my father would always tell me " Martin , there is none so deaf as those who will not hear '' .
all I can do is repeat the figures , which speak for themselves , which I quoted in my speech .
regarding harmonization - I am repeating myself because , from what I can see , on the other side , when the figures are positive , they just will not hear them .
regarding harmonization , since 1991 , sales tax revenues clearly increased , going from $ 5.11 billion in 1989 - 90 to $ 6.15 billion in 1991 - 92 .
and they are complaining about unfair treatment .
i get the impression that the word does not mean the same thing depending on which side of the House one sits on .
we must not be using the same dictionary .
in terms of involvement in economic development -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
i think that this is what our colleague , the hon. member for Outremont and minister responsible for regional development in Quebec , is doing .
a global look at what the fiscal situation was before harmonization , in 1989 , and after harmonization , in 1991 , shows that taxation adjustments had to made to absorb the transitional costs associated with this harmonization .
this is the reality .
so , respectfully , will he admit that the suggestion made this morning by the Bloc Quebecois is totally non - partisan ?
so , I ask .
if the hon. member is protecting Quebec ' s interests , might it not be a good idea to make representations to his minister and to convince him ?
hon. Martin Cauchon :
Mr. Speaker , to go back to the proverb referred to by the hon. member , we must not confuse the tree with the forest .
how could I possibly say that the Bloc is not strictly motivated by political interests given that , in the matter of the GST , harmonization has proven very beneficial to Quebec . So , Bloc members are only motivated by partisan politics .
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner ( Portage - Lisgar , Ref. ) :
the present Canadian heritage minister said in this House that everyone knows the GST is largely responsible for a flood of cross border shopping that is costing thousands of Canadian jobs .
why is the parliamentary secretary pursuing the GST policy and killing the jobs of Canadians with a tax that places a heavy burden on our tourist industry ?
i would like to ask the hon. parliamentary secretary how he justifies that comment ?
hon. Martin Cauchon :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to point out that the harmonization of the GST by the government is based on a process which is equitable and which has been very respectful of the need and reality of the provinces .
i do not understand the point made by the member of the Reform Party considering the fact that across Canada the harmonization has been respectful .
harmonization has been well received by all the provinces across Canada .
even looking at Quebec we will see that its minister of finance does not speak much about the tax because he knows that harmonization is benefiting the province .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise to address the motion of the Bloc Quebecois , which reads :
that this House condemn the government for blatant unfairness to Quebec in the matter of the GST -
the official opposition opposes the motion because this is a motion which only speaks to one province .
what Canadians need generally is tax relief .
we oppose special tax deals which try to create special privileges for people based on this kind of politics .
what we really oppose most of all is the kind of tax record the government has foisted upon Canadians over the past several years .
it is a tax record which has resulted in stagnant economic growth , declining family income and record high levels of unemployment .
i said it before and I will say it again , we are now in our 86 th month straight of over 9 % unemployment , or is it the 87 th month .
i am 29 .
the government ' s tax record is record taxes .
i would like to point out that the government promised not to raise a penny in taxes before it was elected in 1993 .
i remember because at the time I was involved with the Canadian Taxpayers Federation , a group of grassroots taxpayers .
the group was a little bit skeptical when these Liberals came calling in October 1993 and promised after their brilliant fiscal record of the Trudeau years not to raise taxes and not to increase the debt .
we were a little skeptical .
we asked the Prime Minister , as did Canadians , would the first red book involve any tax increases given the manifold promises included in it .
the Prime Minister said no , there were no tax increases in this plan , except there might be a war and in the case of a war , they might have to raise taxes .
well there was a war , it was a war on Canadian taxpayers .
that I think is the mother of all political lies , of all political mistruths ever uttered by a politician .
the government should hang its head in shame .
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Portage - Lisgar in a few moments .
it is interesting that the government still claims to be in favour of the GST when recently a number of focus groups were conducted by one of the Liberal government ' s favourite hack polling firms .
those Canadians in those focus groups said they thought the GST was an atrocity .
they thought it ought to be abolished .
they said that there was no way they would let the government out of that commitment , the promise it made in the 1993 election .
what happened ?
the government filed the focus group tests away in some filing cabinet in the back of the finance minister ' s office until some enterprising taxpayer decided to find out what kind of information about the GST was being generated at the expense of taxpayers .
what did the finance minister have to say when this access to information request was made to release the results of these polls and focus groups ?
he said that no , Canadians will not be allowed access to what they said about the GST at their expense .
not only did the Liberals lie about the GST promise , they would not even let Canadians see what Canadians advised the government to do because they knew how humiliated they would be if the facts came out .
my question to my hon. friends opposite is , what are they afraid of ?
why do they not want to let Canadians see what those focus groups said ?
what are they trying to hide ?
it is really shocking .
the one thing this government still has not learned is that Canadians want to keep more of what they earn .
the Liberal Party has always believed that tax dollars are moneys that the government somehow has a proprietary claim on .
we in the Reform Party believe that the money people earn belongs first , foremost and finally to them and their families so that they can support themselves and their businesses and help the economy to grow .
increasingly Canadians are beginning to realize that the top economic priority for this country is tax relief .
the government said that 50 % of any future surpluses would go to new spending .
it did not think that a party such as ours would be able to demonstrate public support for tax relief .
the government thinks people are greedy because they want to keep a little bit more of their earnings , because middle class families want to be able to take a vacation every now and then on the money they earn .
the government thinks that is greedy .
the government assumes that Canadians would be opposed to tax relief .
but lo and behold , this past weekend a poll came out .
fortunately it was a public poll , one not commissioned by the government or we would not have seen it .
this polls shows us that the number of Canadians who want tax relief now has tripled in the last couple of months .
the priorities of Canadians are becoming increasingly evident .
Canadians are calling for tax relief .
they are calling for integrity in government .
cut spending , balance the budget so that we can scrap the GST and maybe they can salvage a little patina of their now much tarnished political credibility .
Mr. Jim Pankiw ( Saskatoon - Humboldt , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , we heard a few proverbs here a couple of minutes ago and I have one of my own .
when it comes to fiscal management , this Liberal government is a few sandwiches short of a picnic .
the reality is that the regressive tax regime of this government is forcing Canadians to shop outside their own country .
if the Liberal government cannot see that reality and realize that something is wrong , then I suggest it is not just a few sandwiches short of a picnic but the whole basketful .
an hon. member :
you are going to agree with him , too .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
Mr. Speaker , yes , I will surprise my colleagues opposite by agreeing with the hon. member .
an hon. member :
you are a few sandwiches short , too .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
i am a few sandwiches short as well .
that is right .
the arrogance of the Liberal Party of Canada never ceases to amaze me .
i have to make a confession that I do not think I have made in this place before .
an hon. member :
oh , no .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
it is true .
but I learned from my mistake and I went on the high road .
i decided to no longer support the party of taxing and spending and broken promises .
i was a young Canadian concerned about no economic future .
i was a young Canadian concerned about a future steeped in debt given to me by this Liberal Party .
i had had it .
when I finally saw a party which was willing to stand up against public borrowing and tax increases and spending my future , I decided to support that party .
all I can say to the hon. member is that too many Canadians are going to shoe stores in Minot to buy their shoes .
too many Canadians are going south of the border because of this tax burden .
it is time we kept that business , those dollars and those jobs and those futures here in Canada , at home where they belong , by giving Canadians tax relief starting with the GST .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
Mr. Jason Kenney :
Mr. Speaker , it is a difficult challenge but I think I am up to it .
before I answer that very prescient question I would like to remind the hon. member that there was a government in this place between 1984 and 1993 . I think it was governed by a guy by the name of Brian Mulroney , a name not very -
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
they groan .
my PC friends groan whenever the name is mentioned .
i can understand why .
that government raised taxes 71 times in nine years .
it was a shameful record that increased taxes on the middle class family by nearly $ 3,000 a year .
it was a record that deindexed the tax bracket so that middle income earners were pushed into a higher bracket .
however after the CPP it will be 37 times .
all I know is that billions and billions of dollars representing hope and opportunity for the future has been taxed away .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
it being close to 2 o ' clock , we will now proceed to Statements by Members .
statements BY MEMBERS
Mr. Larry McCormick ( Hastings - Frontenac - Lennox and Addington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , for four years two brothers , Robert and Duncan Hough , have worked 10 acres of their family farm for the Foodgrains Bank .
today it is a privilege to recognize the family who operates Hough Haven Farms .
each year the Houghs have been raising corn and donating the proceeds to the Foodgrains Bank .
in turn , the dollars and grains are directed toward food related projects in the developing world .
the Hough family first got involved in the Foodgrains Bank when Andy Palmer of the Napanee Rotary Club approached them seeking support .
for four years Hough Haven Farms has been generously donating land and labour .
others are also involved .
for example , this year Bradshaw Feed , O ' Neill Feed and Tri - County Agri - Mart donated seed and fertilizer .
supporting the Foodgrains Bank is truly a co - operative effort .
farmers and their suppliers are making a big difference by sharing the Canadian harvest with those in need around the world .
i am very proud to stand in the House today to recognize the humanitarians who are making these important contributions .

cancer
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , prostate cancer kills more men in Canada than any cancer except lung cancer .
the treatment of the 20,000 men who are expected to be diagnosed with prostate cancer in Canada this year will cost our health care system approximately $ 300 million .
both diseases are very serious and are analogous as both are hormonal .
the government promotes itself on gender equity .
perhaps it is time to rethink its definition of equal .
before allocating any money for medical research , I urge the government to base its decisions on scientific , measurable and transparent criteria .
fairness across the board is the only way .

riding OF LAURENTIDES
Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the riding of Laurentides has been heavily affected by the policies of the federal government .
whether in its inaction and lack of interest in the Mirabel airport question , or in its controversial move of the employment centre from Saint - J 茅 r 么 me to Saint - Antoine - des - Laurentides , the government has turned a deaf ear to demands from various socio - economic groups in my riding .
while the Bloc Quebecois members have been working like mad along with provincial and municipal elected representatives to make Quebec a prosperous nation , the federal government is , through its policies , thumbing its nose at the wishes of the community and flouting the basic principles of responsible government .
when I see the federal government acting in this way , it seems to me more essential than ever to make Quebec a sovereign country and to do so as soon as possible .

Mrs. Taylor is visiting Parliament today and on Monday will be presented by the Speaker with a copy of the page from the Book of Remembrance commemorating the death of her son , Richard , who died following an attack on his tank during the march from Normandy to Falaise .

CANDU REACTORS
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron ( Verch 猫 res , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , not so long ago , the government decided to abruptly withdraw its annual contribution of $ 7.2 million to the Tokamak project in Varennes , a research project on the development of nuclear fusion .
it preferred to concentrate its efforts on Candu reactors , which still function with the virtually outmoded technology of nuclear fission .
recently , Ontario Hydro decided to close seven of its Candu reactors .
why ?
because after 15 years of use , these reactors are no longer safe .
so now , after billions of dollars in investments , these reactors will be replaced by thermal power plants , which increase pollution levels by at least 50 % .

Mr. Speaker , starting this evening and until November 10 , delegates from some 40 francophone countries will be gathering at a forum in Montreal on the subject of education and the environment .
this event of unprecedented scope , which was prepared long ago , is the logical next step to the hopes raised by the Brundtland report in 1982 and the Rio earth summit .
i would like to point out that our government has provided support for this event , which was organized primarily by the Centrale de l ' enseignement du Qu 茅 bec and the Association qu 茅 b 茅 coise pour la promotion de l '茅 ducation relative 脿 l ' environnement .

SOMMET DE LA FRANCOPHONIE
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Pierrefonds - Dollard , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as many members of this House know , the Sommet de la Francophonie will be held in Hanoi , Vietnam , from November 14 to 16 .
the seventh summit will be a turning point in the development of multilateral francophonie .
indeed , this summit will elect a new secretary general , who will become a political spokesperson and arbiter of multilateral francophone co - operation .
the summit will also formalize the move of the Francophonie into a new era , by focusing on the information highway and promoting economic development .
canada has been a leader of the Francophonie since its inception more than 25 years ago .
the fact that the Prime Minister will lead the Canadian delegation to the Hanoi summit shows how important he feels our participation in this international forum is .
he will be accompanied by the Minister for International Cooperation and Minister responsible for Francophonie .
i wish them both a successful participation in the seventh Sommet de la Francophonie .

south ASIAN COMMUNITY
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I bring to the attention of the House that 1997 marks the centennial of the south Asian community in Canada .
it was in 1897 that the first official documents regarding the arrival of south Asians in Canada were recorded .
the year 1997 marks a century for a community that today contributes fully to the cultural and economic dynamism of the country , yet continues to fight daily against discrimination .
only in 1947 , 50 years ago , were the south Asians awarded full rights of citizenship , including the right to vote .
today Canadians of south Asian origin are active in all sectors of our society : professors , skilled workers , doctors or here in the House of Commons .
this remarkable achievement should remind us of the importance of an open immigration policy based on the recognition of immigrants ' contributions to development .
diversity is at the heart of our country ' s history and future .
for this reason I want to join my voice with others in congratulating Canadians of south Asian origin and heritage and commit to working against any initiative that would threaten to weaken -

QUEBEC GOVERNMENT
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , another scandal has rocked the beautiful Quebec City area .
according to a secret memo from Quebec ' s international relations department , the separatist government plans to establish bilateral relations with secessionist regions of Europe .
the separatist government continues to act like a virtual sovereign government .
the same government will not take a stand on the sovereignist aspirations of Tibet , arguing that because of its current status Quebec cannot hazard an opinion on the matter .
a few days ago , the same separatist government admitted making an error in judgment with respect to Guadeloupe .
if we pay attention , next we will hear that Sylvain Simard is going to Corsica to promote its liberation .
the separatists should stop acting like amateurs and start behaving responsibly in a matter of such importance to Quebec and Canada .
once again , the colonized separatists are acting like colonials .
Quebec deserves better .

the ECONOMY
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , last Friday the Older Adults in Action group in my constituency of Markham shared their grave concerns with me regarding the level of the national debt .
this group with over 700 members indicated that their number one priority is the paying down of the debt to lessen the burden their children and grandchildren face .
an Angus Reid poll released last Saturday indicated that when asked what we should do with budget surpluses , 84 % of Canadians favoured either paying down the debt or implementing a tax reduction .
the government must commit to balance the budget and stimulate financial growth .
this means giving Canadians tax breaks in the form of lower EI deductions to offset proposed hikes in CPP premiums .
we must commit to securing our financial future so that generations are left unburdened .

Mr. Speaker , yesterday , Quebeckers paid a vibrant tribute to a new Canadian hero , Jacques Villeneuve .
however , I was shocked to see the Soci 茅 t 茅 Saint - Jean - Baptiste use this event to try to score political points .
the SSJB ' s president , Guy Bouthillier , even boasted about it when he said that all events have a political dimension .
Jacques Villeneuve showed once again that he was a true champion by not falling into this disgraceful separatist trap .
yesterday , we saw that Jacques Villeneuve , like the Liberal government , had firm control of the steering wheel .
bravo Jacques , our new Formula One world champion .

Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain ( Guelph - Wellington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canadians will pause next week to honour our war dead .
the poem In Flanders Fields will be read often on November 11 .
in Flanders Fields was written by Guelph native John McCrae .
Guelph - Wellington is the proud home to the McCrae Museum , John McCrae School and John McCrae Branch of the Canadian Legion .
last month Toronto businessman Arthur Lee purchased John McCrae ' s war medals at an auction and promptly donated them to the McCrae Museum .
in doing so , Mr. Lee reminded us all of the importance of being Canadian and asked that Canada remain united .
on behalf of the residents of Guelph - Wellington and every Canadian , I rise to thank Mr. Lee , who is with us here today .
Mr. Lee , thank you for your generosity , for your love of Canada , the best country in the world .

oral QUESTION PERIOD
environment
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , government members profess to be the great guardians of the environment .
greener than grass they are .
they are going to save the planet at Kyoto .
yet this same government , when it smells cash , bypasses its own environmental review laws to sell nuclear reactors to China and bypasses its own environmental protection standards to sell nuclear reactors to Turkey .
why does the government violate its own environmental standards ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in handling all these transactions the government is confident that we have followed all appropriate rules and regulations both in our country and internationally in countries that are potential purchasers of Candu reactors .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , forgive us if we are a little sceptical about the reply of the Minister of Natural Resources .
yesterday he tried to hide the fact that the Liberals sold nuclear reactors overseas without following Canadian environmental protection standards .
i ask the minister of natural resources who is telling the truth , the minister or AECL .
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. gentleman should have a research department that extends beyond monitoring CBC news .
what was quoted on the news last night was 15 or 20 seconds out of perhaps a 20 minute or half an hour interview .
the hon. member might be interested in AECL ' s position .
it will be issuing a statement later today that will demonstrate complete consistency with what I said yesterday .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the minister is emitting a cloud of confusion .
yesterday the prime minister said in the House that everything was made public when he signed the nuclear deal with China , but that is not true .
the Liberals refused to reveal whether Canada must accept China ' s nuclear waste .
they will not reveal the secret financing deal and it is still a secret whether or not Canada has agreed to be held liable for nuclear accidents in China .
why does the government not clear the air and make public all details of the AECL sales to China and to Turkey ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , everything that is required according to law to be released is released .
if there are further matters that are subsequently dealt with by the courts , of course those court judgments will be followed .
in the meantime , the hon. gentleman should understand that Candu and AECL are involved in commercially competitive situations .
i am sure the hon. gentleman would not want to expose a major Canadian corporation to a competitive disadvantage internationally as long as that corporation is following all the relevant rules and regulations , which it is .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Canadian corporations the minister talks about do not know which set of laws to follow .
there are two of them , the government operates with such a double standard .
the government waives its own laws for the China Candu reactors .
its own justice department told it that it may well lose a court case over it .
then what do government members do ?
they turn around and make the same kind of bargains with Turkey .
they just do not get it .
how can we be sure that the double standard the government operates by will not cause a global disaster ?
where is the proof ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
the hon. lady should know that in developing any of these facilities , whether they are in Canada or anywhere else in the world , they must be licensable according to Canadian standards as established by the Atomic Energy Control Board .
they must meet and they do meet every nuclear safety regulation established by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
the Liberal government looks so green and caring on the outside , but when it is cut open it is still Liberal red .
that is all there is to it .
it waives its own laws to outbid the U.S. , Japan and the French - German consortium , and the minister knows it .
it has one law for Canada and another law for other countries in the world .
frankly we are sick and tired of this double law .
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am sure the tens of thousands of employees across Canada involved in working in connection with the Candu technology will be very interested in the hon. lady ' s condemnation of them .
in fact Candu complies with every rule and regulation of the Atomic Energy Control Board and every rule and regulation of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
the Candu has an exceptional record of technical performance everywhere that it has been established either in this country or around the world .

drinking WATER
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , two letters written by officials from the Quebec health department - one dated September 26 , 1995 , and the other May 2 , 1996 - clearly stated that drinking water comes under the jurisdiction of Quebec ' s environment department .
however , the federal government went ahead with Bill C - 76 in December 1996 , and then Bill C - 14 last Friday .
yesterday , the Quebec environment minister stated unequivocally that he disagrees with this measure .
will the Prime Minister or the Acting Prime Minister admit that the federal government never had Quebec ' s support on this bill ?
the Speaker :
the parliamentary secretary .
Mr. Joseph Volpe ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon member well knows there is a letter from the minister of health of Quebec , the Minister of Health ' s correspondent in Quebec .
there was an indication by the minister of health , in an area that is under the competence of the Minister of Health of Canada , that there was agreement .
consultations took place and the result is a piece of legislation that we see as Bill C - 14 today and that was before us in the last parliament -
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , for the hon. member ' s information , Bill C - 76 was never debated in this House .
i would like the parliamentary secretary to rise in his place and tell this House that he does have a letter from a Quebec minister or the Quebec government supporting Bill C - 76 or Bill C - 14 .
does he have a letter of support from the Quebec government , yes or no ?
if he does , let him confirm it , and if he does not , then he should stop talking nonsense .
Mr. Joseph Volpe ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have difficulty understanding feigned outrage .
we have already admitted there was correspondence with the minister of health in Quebec .
the Minister of Health of Canada has done what he is required to do , consult with his counterparts .
the letter from the ministry of health in Quebec indicated there was no problem with the legislation then before the House , legislation which the Bloc chose to ignore in the last parliament and which is substantially the same as Bill C - 14 in this Parliament .
we are operating in the jurisdiction over which we have authority and that is all the legislation represents .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , no minister of the Quebec government has given his support .
my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs .
whatever this government may say , it remains that things are off to a very bad start with this bill from the Department of Health .
will the minister admit that the way this government is dealing with the issue of drinking water has sown the seeds of a new federal - provincial dispute , since it takes Quebec ' s agreement for granted without having held real consultations with Quebec ' s political leaders ?
Mr. Joseph Volpe ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we can keep going on this , but it is the practice of the Department of Health like all other federal departments to consult with their provincial counterparts when there is legislation before the House .
the Minister of Health for Canada is responsible for the health of Canadians , and that is the ministry or the department which consulted to ensure that the legislation received the appropriate -
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the federal government never consulted the Government of Quebec about Bill C - 14 , which has now been introduced in the House .
since the Government of Quebec is presently holding consultations on its water management policy as part of its forum , and in light of the apparent mess which is about to emerge , can the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs ask his colleague to withdraw his bill ?
Mr. Joseph Volpe ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , why would the Minister of Health remove a piece of legislation which addresses the health of Canadians and for which he and his department have sought and received positive responses , I might say , also from the -
an hon. member :
Mr. Joseph Volpe :
it is not a lie .
it is the deputy minister of Health in Quebec who is responsible for maintaining communications with the federal Department of Health .
the Speaker :
colleagues , I thought I heard a word .
i want to make sure that all the words we use today are parliamentary .

canada PENSION PLAN
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , last week the finance minister told the House that all provincial governments had agreed to the consultation document on gender analysis of changes to the Canada pension plan .
that information is not correct .
in fact the minister will know by now that federal and provincial status of women ministers have agreed that the gender impact analysis done on CPP changes was inadequate .
now that the minister knows this , will he conduct a comprehensive analysis of the impact on women of all pension reform options being considered ?
hon. Hedy Fry ( Secretary of State ( Multiculturalism ) ( Status of Women ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I think the hon. member is mistaken .
having been at the federal , provincial and territorial ministers ' meeting in Halifax I can say that the federal , provincial and territorial ministers for the status of women did not say anything about gender analysis in the CPP phase 1 ; but they did request unanimously that in phase 2 , which is coming up , there be comprehensive gender analysis done in light of new information that has come about with an economic indicators project launched at that meeting .
i know our finance minister is very interested in looking at those indicators and doing the appropriate thing .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , if the minister will not listen to concerns about gender analysis in this round of CPP , why would we trust them to say they will listen to gender concerns in the next round ?
will the finance minister and the Minister responsible for the Status of Women also deny testimony before the finance committee that documents precisely how CPP changes penalize women for living longer ?
does the minister deny that women are hurt most by freezing the basic exemption ?
does the minister deny that women are hurt most by cutting the death benefit ?
does the minister deny that -
the Speaker :
the hon. minister of multiculturalism .
hon. Hedy Fry ( Secretary of State ( Multiculturalism ) ( Status of Women ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , on the contrary .
all these were maintained and will be dealt with further in part 2 .

the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Speaker , I have a letter signed by the federal Minister of the Environment dated October 28 , written to her provincial colleagues that says this :
we can assume that there will be two or three provincial or territorial representatives included in the Kyoto delegation .
this would include one representative of a provincial or territorial energy department and one representative of an environment department .
how does the government square this statement , written in a letter dated October 28 , with what it said in the House of Commons about including the provinces in the Canadian delegation at Kyoto ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I and my colleague , the Minister of the Environment , have had extensive discussions with our counterparts .
those discussions are ongoing .
i am told that the tradition with respect to provincial involvement in international delegations is one or two representatives of the provinces who then report back to the full group collectively .
we have decided that in this case it would be useful to expand that to three .
the provinces may make additional requests .
we will consider that matter when we meet with all of them next week in Regina .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , as usual the minister is showing himself badly informed .
in Rio , he will know because his colleagues , the Minister of Finance and the minister of the environment of the day were there , there were 7 governments out of the 12 possible governments that were represented in Rio .
i want to ask another question about an addendum to this letter that explains to the provinces the Japanese position but does not explain to the provinces the Canadian position .
i would like to know how the government expects provincial governments to buy in and implement a position that it will explain to them on November 12 , only 19 days away from the summit .
does it realistically think the Canadian provinces can accept , comprehend and implement such a position only 19 days away from the summit ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the attachment to the letter was the fulfilment of a commitment that the Minister of the Environment made to keep all her counterparts fully apprised of the various positions or potential positions being taken by various countries around the world .
she also made the commitment , as have I , that we would work very hard with the provinces in the development of the Canadian position .
we are trying to be inclusive rather than unilateral .
perhaps that approach will have more success in Kyoto than the approach taken by the hon. gentleman -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Medicine Hat .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
what a radical notion .
now that the government has shown it is willing to break its own environmental laws to cut a business deal , why in the world would it expect any would - be polluters in Canada to obey the laws of this country ?
why is the government saying do as it says , not as it does ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , given the unctuous admonitions of the Reform Party , I really must point out that the very law it is holding up waving with great fanfare today is the very law that it voted against in the House of Commons when it had the opportunity .
the government of Canada is following all applicable rules and regulations .
we are confident of our position .
some others have proceeded with a court proceeding .
we will see the results of that court proceeding in due course .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
how can we say to a pulp mill or a mining operation that if it pollutes we will prosecute it to the full extent of the law but when a government blatantly and knowingly ignores its own laws , that is just the way we do business in Canada ?
how can the government say " if you don ' t like it , lump it because were are government and we are beyond the law '' ?
how can it say that ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , obviously the Government of Canada is not taking the position the hon. gentleman alleges .
in all these transactions we have followed the rules that we believe to be applicable .
if others have a different point of view they are free to challenge that procedure in the courts , as some have , and the courts will rule in due course .

CANDU REACTORS
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu 茅 bec , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
the secret cabinet decision report dated April 24 , 1997 reveals that the government proposes to get around the Environmental Assessment Act by conducting shadow assessments of foreign projects .
will the government make a commitment to fully comply with the law by making public any information necessary for conducting an environmental assessment before giving final approval to funding the sale of CANDU reactors to Turkey ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have said this before and I will repeat it .
a Candu plant , in order to be built either in Canada or anywhere in the world , must be licensable according to Canadian standards which are established by the Atomic Energy Control Board .
as the hon. member will know , those standards are very stringent .
in addition to that , AECL ensures nuclear safety in all technical aspects of reactor siting , design , construction , commissioning -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Quebec .
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu 茅 bec , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , according to this same cabinet document , the government intends to break the law in the name of international competitiveness .
is this because Canadian environmental laws are no good or is it simply that the government is irresponsible and prepared to do anything to sell its last CANDU reactors ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , if I understood the question correctly , it was whether the government is being irresponsible .
the answer is no .

the SENATE
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the prime minister angrily dismissed the idea of letting Albertans elect their own senator .
in doing so he stuck his finger in the eyes of Alberta ' s premier , Alberta ' s Liberal leader , the legislature and the people of the province .
as a diversion he pointed to the Charlottetown accord but , as the justice minister will know , there is nothing in the current Canadian Constitution which prevents the government from appointing the winner of a provincial Senate election to the Senate .
what possible legal and constitutional reason does the government have -
the Speaker :
the hon. Deputy Prime Minister .
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the position of the Constitution is very clear .
appointments to the Senate are made by the Government of Canada via the prime minister .
we intend to abide by the Constitution .
before in question period Reform Party members were talking about obeying the law .
why do they not want us to obey the law when it comes to the Canadian Constitution ?
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Deputy Prime Minister knows better than that .
there is nothing in the law that prevents the Government of Canada from appointing to the Senate someone who has been elected provincially .
Albertans are sick and tired .
they have made this clear numerous times .
they do not want unelected , unaccountable senators having anything to do with passing laws or spending money .
when is democracy , not patronage , going to govern appointments to the Canadian Senate ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wonder why the leader of the Reform Party is rejecting the very process which led to his own father ' s serving here for so many years .
if the leader of the Reform Party wants to have senators who are accountable , why does he propose a system for which there is no re - election after someone is first elected ?

VCN MARINE RADIO
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp 茅 - 脦 les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for the Coast Guard .
the future of the Magdalen Islands marine radio station is still unclear .
about ten days ago , the parliamentary secretary announced that it would be moved to Rivi 猫 re - au - Renard and this week , departmental officials are meeting with the employees to talk about their relocation .
can the minister give us the assurance that before taking a final decision , he will review the warnings I gave him about the breakdowns that would create huge security problems in the Gulf of St. Lawrence ?
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , at the beginning of Oral Question Period , the hon. member handed me an envelope .
apparently , this envelope contains some information about the Coast Guard radio station in Cap - aux - Meules .
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp 茅 - 脦 les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I just wanted to give the minister a reminder , as he already received a copy and discussed the issue with me .
if I understand correctly , the minister just told us a few moments ago that he has yet to make a final decision .
he intends to take our arguments into account .
why is the minister wasting $ 75,000 to relocate these employees , when he is not sure yet if these people will have to move or not ?
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I just received an envelope that contains a letter from the hon. member .
if he wants me to provide him with a straight answer , to tell him if the Cap - aux - Meules station stays or goes , then I would prefer to review the information he just handed me .
i have not had the opportunity yet to look at it and I would like to do so out of courtesy for the hon. member .

canada PENSION PLAN
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the finance minister ' s new CPP fund is already in trouble .
it turns out its 10 year value will be $ 41 billion less than the figure he gave us just two months ago .
it makes one wonder how shaky his other predictions are .
will the minister tell us how much premiums will have to increase to cover his $ 41 billion mistake ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , there is no change in the premiums .
the hon. member ought to know that actuarial assumptions , economic projections , are updated .
it is simply a question of projections and indeed there will be changes in those projections next year .
it all depends on what one assumes for interest rates , for mortality and growth .

we understand that it will be eight or ten days before both parties receive the report .
is the minister aware that any delay in making the report public will increase tensions at Canada Post and the likelihood of a postal strike before Christmas ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have received the conciliation commissioner ' s report .
this is a short report and I would expect that it would be released sooner than that .

Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , an experimental index of social health developed by Human Resources Development Canada suggests there is a growing gap between the health of the economy and the well - being of Canadians .
my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
does he concur with the findings in the report , and if so , what does he suggest be done to narrow the gap ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the member for his very important question .
the government has a very important role to play to level the playing field between the economic health and the social health of this country .
under the leadership of the Prime Minister and with the hard work of the finance minister our fiscal house is in order .
that allows us to have surpluses in the country which we will be investing toward children , in the national child benefit , toward programs for persons with disabilities and toward the aboriginal head start program in order to have a better society .

CANADIAN ARMED FORCES
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , recently we stood in this House and honoured the men and women of the junior ranks in the Canadian Armed Forces for their outstanding performance during the Manitoba flood .
they did not get a pay raise .
in contrast , Canadians are shocked to learn today that tainted colonels and generals in the Canadian Armed Forces have received so - called performance bonuses .
can the minister explain how people the likes of Vanier , Roy , Boyle , Murray and Labb 茅 have received performance bonuses while our troops have received nothing ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , again the research from the Reform Party is not very good .
it was over a year ago that this performance pay was allowed .
i cannot comment specifically on who got it and who did not get it because that is not in accordance with the Privacy Act . Individuals within the forces as within all the public service have a right to privacy in this case .
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is fun to get up to do a few rounds with the latest Minister of National Defence .
what he is saying is 100 % pure balderdash .
how can the minister stand in this House in front of Canadians and justify performance bonuses for these people ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member cannot assume who got it and who did not get it .
he does not know .
he is guessing .
it is in accordance with a general provision for people in the public service .
it was also provided for the people in the Canadian forces .
i might add that in terms of the rank and file , there have been two increases to close the gap between public service and Canadian forces personnel this year , one on April 1 and one on October 1 .
we are also working on another economic increase which will certainly give the rank and file of the Canadian forces a very deserved increase in pay .

national DEFENCE
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is also for the minister of defence .
in paying $ 474 million to cancel the EH - 101 in 1993 , the Prime Minister said that it was a Cadillac when we needed a Chev .
this government is on the verge of reversing itself when it announces the decision to purchase the Cormoran which is the kissing cousin to the EH - 101 and if not a Cadillac certainly is a very heavy Chevy .
when the minister makes this announcement next week , what assurances will he give the public that the Cormoran is the top value for money helicopter for our search and rescue team ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , there has been no determination as to when the announcement will be made .
no decision has yet been made .
when the decision is made it will be done on the basis of what is the best value for the Canadian taxpayers and what meets our operational needs .
it indeed will not be the Cadillac version that the Tory government was trying to push down our throats .
it will be a more modest version of a helicopter .
without saying which one it is , it is going to be a lot cheaper than what the Tories would have foisted on us .
* * *
foreign AFFAIRS
Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
it concerns the upcoming APEC summit .
section 19 of Canada ' s Immigration Act bars the admission of persons who are heads of a government that is or was engaged in gross human rights violations or crimes against humanity .
will the minister explain why Indonesian President Suharto , guilty of genocidal policies in East Timor and massive human rights violations in Indonesia , is not being barred under the Immigration Act or charged with war crimes if he sets foot on Canadian territory ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as a lawyer the hon. member should know that any determination of that status is by the courts under international law .
there has been no such decision by any international court under any international law .
president Suharto will be a guest of Canada at the APEC summit and I expect he will be given the proper courtesy that any guest of Canada is afforded .

search AND RESCUE HELICOPTERS
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , in 1993 , before I became a member of the Conservative caucus , the Tory government included in the helicopter contract the cost of training , spare parts , maintenance and any other costs incurred prior to the helicopters ' coming into service .
why is the Prime Minister swindling Canadians by not including in his contract all additional costs when taxpayers know full well they will end up paying the whole bill sooner or later ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I heard the word helicopter so I jumped up .
i did not hear much of anything else other than something to the effect that he was not part of the previous Conservative government prior to our taking office in 1993 . Thank goodness for that .
he is most fortunate because they really botched up the helicopter job when they were in power .
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister is telling Canadians he is saving them a billion dollars .
does he think Canadians are not paying attention ?
it would be nice if he tabled in Parliament all costs of cancelling the helicopters , but he will keep his partisan political secrets .
when is the Prime Minister going to fess up and tell Canadians about the extra billion dollars it is costing to keep our three d helicopters , decrepit , dilapidated and dangerous , in the air ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we do not fly dangerous helicopters .
there is no doubt that these helicopters are getting toward the end of their lives .
there is no doubt that they need to be replaced and will be replaced soon .
if the Conservatives had not botched this up previously , there might have been a helicopter long before this .
we are going to get good value for the Canadian taxpayer .
we are going to buy helicopters that are off the shelf type and not the developing kind of helicopter , a proposition that would have cost us a lot more money .
even with the penalty that had to be paid to cancel the previous sad deal , we still will be saving taxpayers ' money .

regional DEVELOPMENT
Ms. Aileen Carroll ( Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this government is moving down the information highway and rural communities demand that they not be left behind .
they demand a share in the economic benefits of this knowledge based society .
my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry .
what is being done to ensure that Canadians wherever they live share in the economic and social potential of these future developments ?
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , let me make it clear that the regional development agencies are working in regions across Canada to ensure that the regions are developed .
in addition , communities futures programs across this country are assisting small communities to ensure that lending and information is available .
the community access program which we have been promoting for the last number of years in 1,250 communities , 9,500 schools and 1,200 public libraries makes it easier for rural communities to have access .
in addition the Canada community investment program has been assisting small and rural communities .
* * *
correctional SERVICE
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the solicitor general ' s own internal survey of nearly 5,000 prison guards said the solicitor general could do a much better job of protecting the public and his prisons were too cushy .
seventy - six per cent of prison guards said the correctional service could be more accountable to outsiders .
can the government explain to Canadians why it is ignoring the prison guards ' recommendations ?
Mr. Nick Discepola ( Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the survey which the hon. member refers to is the second in a series of surveys that are determined and designed exactly to find out the employees ' opinions .
the survey itself as the member says reports that 50 % of respondents claim that there would be much less crime if the prisoners were more uncomfortable .
i do not understand from that how they can ascertain that the prisons are very cushy .
last week we had the same party saying that the prisons were too dangerous .
this week they are saying that the prisons are too cushy .
i wonder which wild rose the hon. member has been smelling lately .
* * *
social HOUSING
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is to the minister responsible for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation .
the federal government has indicated that it intends to withdraw from social housing .
at the present time , the federal government is spending about $ 2 billion on housing .
to date , agreements have been signed with Saskatchewan , Newfoundland and New Brunswick .
could the minister bring us up to date on the negotiations between his government and Quebec in the area of housing ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
there are negotiations with the province of Quebec and , naturally , we hope that they will come to a satisfactory conclusion and that an agreement will be signed as soon as possible .
* * *
youth
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Justice .
yesterday the city of Victoria released a critical report on the problem of sexually exploited youth , many of whom trade in sex for the basic necessities of survival .
this issue has been of serious concern for years but has been too often ignored .
will the minister commit to review and act upon these urgent recommendations ?
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for her question .
* * *
national DEFENCE
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the 1993 deal to purchase helicopters included an ironclad guarantee that at least 50 % of the components would have been made in Canada and 10 % of every EH - 101 sold worldwide would have been Canadian made .
this would have meant jobs for Canadians , new technology for Canadian businesses and a substantial increase in tax revenues for the Canadian government .
these helicopters would have paid for themselves .
will the minister of public works explain why Canadians have to pay extra money for his helicopters -
the Speaker :
the hon. Minister of National Defence .
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I do not understand the audacity of the party that fouled up the previous deal on helicopters to stand up and say all these things .
let me tell you , Mr. Speaker , there are going to be a lot of jobs in all parts of this country when this helicopter deal is finalized .
that is something we are insisting upon in the bidding process .
we want jobs created in this country .

points OF ORDER
oral QUESTION PERIOD
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to refer to an issue in oral questions under Standing Order 37 .
i note today that one party in this House during question period had a question and a supplementary .
that party used two different questions to two different ministers .
i would like to ask you , Mr. Speaker , to clarify whether this practice is acceptable or not .
the Speaker :
i always welcome innovative things in this House .
if a party chooses to have its members split a question , I have been allowing that for the last four weeks now .
the answer to your question directly is yes .
member FOR MEDICINE HAT
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member for Medicine Hat wishes to let it be known that he was never involved with the Conservative caucus .
the Speaker :
i think that will warm the hearts of both caucuses .

business OF THE HOUSE
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would ask the government House leader to update us on the business of the House for the remainder of this week and for the first week that we are back after the break .
as well , I would ask him to update the House on any business rightfully belonging to this House which has been redirected to the Senate .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to inform the House of the following :
i think there will be a resolution tomorrow about the report stage and the third reading of the bill on warrants to arrest , that is Bill C - 16 .
with your permission , before I continue , I would like to thank the House leaders of all parties for their co - operation in achieving consensus on what I am about to read .
next week , there will be a parliamentary recess in honour of Remembrance Day .
afterwards , on Monday November 17 , the government will propose consideration of the motion on amendments to the Constitution Act concerning the school system in Quebec .
an agreement has been reached , so it is still possible we could sit until we conclude the debate , in order to proceed with the vote on the following day .
therefore , the first vote will be taken on Tuesday , November 18 .
on November 18 , we will consider Bill C - 11 on customs duties .
that will be followed by Bill C - 15 , an act to amend the Canada Shipping Act , and by Bill C - 18 , the legislation on powers of designated customs officers .
after that , we will consider Bill C - 17 on Teleglobe Canada and Bill C - 14 concerning the safety of water destined for human consumption .
so this is the legislative agenda for the rest of this week and for the whole week following recess .
the Speaker :
i believe there is unanimous agreement to revert to Statements by Ministers .
routine PROCEEDINGS
remembrance DAY
hon. Fred Mifflin ( Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State ( Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , 79 years ago on the 11 th hour of the 11 th day of the 11 th month the guns of the great war finally fell silent .
the war to end all wars was over .
nations were shattered as the flower of their youth lay slaughtered on the killing fields of Europe .
and across Canada , mothers and fathers , brothers and sisters , sons and daughters wept at the loss of their loved ones .
it is a time to remember those whose blood stains the soil of nations they have helped to liberate from tyranny and oppression .
Mrs. Alice Taylor , this year ' s Silver Cross mother , and Victoria Cross winner , Sergeant Smokey Smith .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
in our history books , we read of Vimy and Passchendaele , Beaumont - Hamel and the Somme .
from our fathers and grandfathers we have heard about the disasters of Hong Kong and Dieppe , the victories in Italy , France , and Belgium , and the liberation of the Netherlands .
and the images of the Korean war would be among the first to flicker across our television screens .
what we can never really understand is the terrible , terrible suffering that our veterans must have endured .
and whatever the war , whatever the campaign , endure they did .
for the ground forces in the mud , muck and mire of the trenches , if bullet or bayonet did not get you , disease would .
whether in the freezing cold of the blood soaked European battlefields or in the hell holes of prison camps in Hong Kong and Japan , or in the rice paddies of Korea , death was never far away .
death by dogfight or enemy flak met our airmen .
nor have our peacekeepers been immune from death and terrible wounds .
but they are just numbers on a page .
they do not tell the human tragedy behind each and every loss .
i have a letter that I think does put a personal face on the tragedy , the suffering and the loss .
it is a letter written to his mother by a young army lieutenant serving in France on the eve of the battle of Amiens on August 7 , 1918 , very close to the end of the war .
the words speak for themselves .
Dearest Mother ,
otherwise my eye is fixed on tomorrow with hope for mankind and with visions of a new world .
a blow will be struck tomorrow which will definitely mark the turn of the tide -
i have no misgivings for myself in tomorrow ' s encounter .
it does not matter whether I survive or fall .
we shall strive only to achieve victory .
we shall not hold our lives dear .
the hour is all the more dramatic for me because , for the first time since I came to France , I am close to the spot consecrated by the blood of our gallant dead .
it was here that noble Raymond fell and Joe and Kenneth shed their blood in freedom ' s cause .
i trust to be as faithful as they .
i shall be my mother and father ' s son tomorrow .
again God bless you all .
your son Hedley .
war , freedom and peace are not just the business of government and the military .
it is a personal concern , it is a personal issue , as this testimony of Remembrance Day holds fast .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise to join with the minister and other hon. members in paying tribute to those brave Canadians who lost their lives or suffered injury in the wars of the 20 th century .
we also pay tribute to those who came home , our veterans and those who serve in our armed forces today .
the veterans that I know face each passing Remembrance Day with a combination of pride and sadness .
the pride of course comes from knowing that they participated in the preservation of freedom and democracy , not only for themselves but for other generations of Canadians and other people around the world .
their sadness arises from the lurking fear that no one really remembers or really cares .
i am reminded of a sad , old World War I song by the Australian Eric Bogle , sung so well by Canada ' s John McDermid , which puts the following words into the mouth of a crippled vet . He said :
and the young people ask ,
what are they marching for ?
and I ask myself the same question .
to those who feel this sadness on Remembrance Day , I want to say not as a member of Parliament or as the Leader of the Opposition but as the father of five children , that we do remember what you are marching for and that we are eternally grateful .
two years ago my wife and I took our oldest son to the airport from which he was to leave for a year of travel and study in Asia and the south Pacific .
it was a time of mixed emotions for us , sadness that he was leaving home for an extended time for the first time , but excitement that he was now through high school and off to see the world before going on with his studies .
it is because those parents and those young people were prepared to make those sacrifices that we have not had to make them .
it is because they suffered those terrible emotions that we do not have to suffer the same .
when I see the veterans marching past the cenotaph , even if their step is slower now and the bones may be stiff and sore , that is the answer we should give to those who ask , what are they marching for .
Mr. Maurice Godin ( Ch 芒 teauguay , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , today , as the Bloc Quebecois critic for veterans issues , I would like to pay tribute to our veterans .
this week , we will carry out together the promise that was made to them by the 35 th Parliament , that is to extend the period of commemoration of Remembrance Day .
indeed , on November 2 , 1995 , at the commemoration of the 50 th anniversary of the end of the second world war , Parliament decided to honour the courage and sacrifice of its military personnel by designating the week preceding Remembrance Day as veterans week .
the main reason that motivated Parliament in its decision was to educate the present generation , which has been fortunate enough to live without any major conflict for more than half a century , on the sense of duty and the freedom dearly won by Quebec and Canadian military personnel .
to preserve the present peace that is still too fragile , we must remember the lessons of history and apply its teachings .
let us remind all that democracy has a cost and , as such , it must be preserved at all cost .
more than 1.5 million Canadians served during the two world wars and in the Korean war and , we will never say this often enough , more than 110,000 soldiers lost their lives during the two major world conflicts , while several hundreds of others died during the Korean conflict and in peace missions under the United Nations .
we must not forget either all the civilians who gave their lives for the cause and those who , behind enemy lines , steadfastly prepared the final victory of the allied forces and democracy .
we must not forget the scope of human misery , the extensive human losses and the horrible suffering endured by all populations during these wars .
during the second world war alone , civilian losses were estimated at more than 40 million .
it is up to us to remind each new generation of young Quebeckers and Canadians of the sacrifices made for a noble cause by an entire generation , be it at Dieppe , in Hong Kong , Korea , concentration camps , not to mention the deportations , and the list goes on .
one of the primary responsibilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs is in fact to keep the memory of their deeds and sacrifices alive .
those are memories I had in mind when , last August , I participated in the ceremonies commemorating the 50 th anniversary of the landing in Dieppe , in Normandy , and with equal gratitude , this weekend , I will be attending ceremonies on the old continent with parliamentarian colleagues and veterans , as part of the Canadian delegation .
humbly I shall pray at the military funeral service for Canadian airmen who died in the second world war but whose remains were just recently found in Belgium , reminding myself that the future of our children was built on the tombstones of our dead .
this week , let us pay tribute to our veterans .
we must learn from these dark hours of history so that never again we will have to relive such sad events .
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , on behalf of the New Democratic Party across Canada , my colleagues and I join with all members of the House in recognizing this coming Tuesday as Remembrance Day .
we believe that we would do well to pause and reflect on its meaning .
i will do so myself .
they do not discuss those days with me very much but I know that they have paid a great price for the freedom that I have to be here today .
we should also remember and honour all those who have made the supreme sacrifice and who willingly gave everything for the cause of peace , and for the cause of democracy .
we must remember the sacrifices and commitment of all those who pursued peace on our behalf in all of the wars , conflicts and peacekeeping missions around the globe .
also we must not forget the contribution of those Canadians who served in the Mackenzie - Papineau Battalion in the Spanish civil war and the members of the merchant marine .
i take this opportunity to remember someone familiar to this House who worked tirelessly for veterans and who showed , perhaps , what we can do , a Canadian who devoted much of his life to securing benefits for those gentlemen and ladies who served in the war and their families .
that is the late Stanley Knowles .
he was a tireless champion on behalf of our veterans and achieved much on their behalf .
we believe that it is part of our obligation to try and build the kind of world for which our veterans gave their lives .
we believe this is a time for us to renew our commitment and our efforts in the pursuit of peace and democracy around the globe .
we hope we will find a way to make life better for those who suffered and continue to suffer as a result of war .
we are honoured to join in this moment of recognition and remembrance for those who died and for those who served and are still with us .
in the tradition of Remembrance Day , we say from our hearts , we will remember them .
their spirits watch us in this House and watch how we deal with the legacy left to us .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
madam Speaker , I rise today on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to pay tribute to the many Canadians who risked their lives , and for those who fell in the cause of peace and freedom that we enjoy today in Canada .
this Remembrance Week commemorates those who sacrificed their lives so that we might enjoy the ways of freedom and the many who gave their lives at an early age .
myself and many Canadians at the age of 18 or 19 were finishing school , heading off to university or starting a career .
although we share the same age , the lives of those who served may have ended .
clearly the ultimate sacrifice made by earlier generations in our country has helped to ensure peace , security and the opportunity for subsequent generations .
historians often note that Canada is one of the few countries in the world that came about peacefully , without bloodshed .
while Confederation did not directly result from military battles on our soil , Remembrance Week reminds us that today Canada was forged by yesterday ' s battles beyond our borders .
the muddy fields of the Somme , the dark skies over the Rhineland , the cold , murky deeps of the North Atlantic , Hong Kong at Christmas ; these are the many places where our soldiers , sailors , airmen , merchant marines , nurses and doctors put their lives on the line .
they fought for their families , their communities and their country .
they defended Canada against aggression as members of the army , navy , air force and the fourth arm of our fighting services , the merchant navy .
many never returned from battle .
the central structure of these Parliament Buildings , the Peace Tower , houses the memorial chamber .
in that chamber are the books of remembrance which hold the names of every Canadian who died for our freedom .
each day a new page is turned .
the altars hold the books for the Boer war , the first great war , the second world war , the Newfoundland memorial , Korea and the merchant marine .
some of the names on those pages today include William Locke , flying officer ; Edmund Masters , able seaman ; Alphonse Roy , soldier ; William Worden , private ; James Daniel , second engineer ; Germain Houle , private .
these names , along with the more than 100,000 names that appear on these tear stained pages are the many reasons that we remember our war dead , our veterans and their families , not just November 11 , but 365 days of each year .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i would now ask the House to rise and observe one minute of silence in memory of the departed .
[ editor ' s Note :
the House observed one minute of silence ]
i wish to inform the House that pursuant to Standing Order 33 ( 2 ) ( b ) because of the ministerial statement government orders will be extended by 20 minutes .

allotted DAY - GOODS AND SERVICES TAX
the House resumed consideration of the motion .
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner ( Portage - Lisgar , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , it is a pleasure to rise in the House today to say a few words on the Bloc motion .
before I start into my little speech , I want to commend my hon. colleague from Calgary Southeast on his comments on this motion .
i would like to point out to this House that here is a young man who was led down the broad path of taxation and spending .
he followed the advice of political pundits who said that this was the way their life would be regulated , that this is the direction that our youth would have to take .
he came to the pinnacle of truth , he looked down and saw the big debt hole and said , " Hold it , I am not jumping '' .
he looked back and saw Reform and he said , " There is my answer .
what did this young man do about it ?
he became active in politics .
and here he is .
and I am proud to be a colleague of theirs .
i would now like to say a few things about the Bloc motion .
i kind of feel sorry for the Quebec government , that it got rooked into this deal .
i do not agree that the deal should ever have been made but I know they have been suffering .
that is exactly what we heard .
an hon. member :
who said that ?
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner :
he is presently the public works and government services minister .
yes , that was his view of the GST when he was on this side .
an hon. member :
so it definitely was a Liberal .
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner :
that is exactly what this motion is talking about , the unfairness .
all of a sudden , it realized that its economy was stopping , that it was deadening itself , it was killing itself .
that is what was happening .
then the pain started coming and it did not know how to cure that pain .
this reminds me of another little incident with my two older children when they were about five or six years old .
what did I do ?
i went out and put a trap in the hole the gopher had dug and covered it up , never suspecting that my two youngsters were watching to see how I did it .
that is what the Quebec government was doing .
it was watching the federal government putting on taxes .
within an hour my kids thought there should be some results .
when you do something you have to have results .
my son and daughter came screaming home , " Dad , help , help '' .
what did I do ?
i had to reduce my kids ' pain .
i took the trap off .
but if we look at what the Bloc did to soften the pain , they put a gopher trap on the other hand and then they really had pain .
and now it is really hurting .
they created it themselves .
how can they blame the federal government ?
they looked in the mirror to see how it was working .
an hon. member :
a partner in crime .
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner :
a partner in crime .
a very good comment .
i did the right thing .
i took the gopher trap off my kids ' hands which relieved the pain totally and made them happy again .
that is what the Quebec government should have done .
it should have removed the tax .
instead it harmonized it and created twice the pain .
if you want to help heal a problem , you do not make it bigger , you put something on it to cure it .
i want to give another couple of examples of how they could have listened to the Liberals when they were in opposition and how they could have solved the problem .
the finance minister admitted that .
the finance minister had a good idea .
he knew what he was talking about .
he had the answer .
we were sitting on this side , waiting for the GST to be killed , to be abolished , to be scrapped .
what did the Bloc and the Quebec government do ?
they said , " Let us jump on the gravy train .
let us get some extra taxes .
let us make things roll in this country .
throw in another tax .
that is the way to go '' .
he said : " My message to the Prime Minister comes after yesterday ' s chilling report from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation which shows that new home construction across the country crashed to a 35 - year low last year .
are we surprised why the Quebec government is feeling the pain ?
i am sure it hit Montreal .
what did it do to the service industries ?
i can remember that in Winnipeg in my own province it killed tourism .
it killed restaurants , small businesses and the service sector .
as the member said , we cannot even afford to get a haircut because we have to pay tax on it .
an hon. member :
so why did they not kill the tax ?
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner :
i do not know why they did not kill the tax .
they were talked into trying to jump on the tax train and grab as much as they could , forgetting that it would hurt more in the end .
i feel sorry for the Quebec government but it is not just Quebec that has been hurt , it has hurt us right across the country .
it is the taxpayers who are suffering .
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I could not help but listen intently to the very informative speech from my hon. colleague .
out west there is a little parasite .
it gets onto human beings and livestock and will suck the lifeblood right out of you .
we call it a tick .
i often wonder if maybe it got its name from politics , from governments trying to suck the lifeblood out of people through taxation .
we know that basically we work more than six months out of the year just to pay taxes in this country .
that means out of every eight hours that a person works , four hours are going to pay taxes in order to keep the governments of our country going .
does the hon. member think it is fair for the people of this country to work so hard and put in the time that they do to pay over 50 % back in taxes to the government to absolutely squander in any way it sees fit without having any input from the taxpayers themselves ?
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner :
madam Speaker , what I would like to point out to the member is that this tick is very dangerous .
if there are enough of those ticks they will not just keep on sucking that red blood , that Liberal blood as we would say , in the tax system , they will kill the animal or the person .
the worst of it is that the tick is not that bad .
the pain is not that bad .
but we have the darn mosquito that continually sucks that red blood .
it continually acts like a tax collector .
when there are little ponds sitting around that are kind of stale that seems to really attract those suckers .
when there is a bankruptcy , the Liberals ' philosophy is that it will create another job .
their philosophy is that some other sucker will come along .
it does not seem to be working too well because the provincial Liberal governments have been falling by the wayside like the mosquitoes and ticks when we start swapping them left and right .
that is what is going to happen in the political field as far as the federal Liberals and politics are concerned .
it happened to the Conservatives who invented the GST .
now the Liberals are trying to take credit for inventing it .
i do not know what the deal is here but I imagine they are hoping that will give some credence to the Conservatives with their philosophy and hope that maybe some day they can swap some seats again .
however , I am afraid it is getting late in the day and these tax suckers , these mosquitoes , will finally kill themselves .

allotted DAY - GOODS AND SERVICES TAX
the House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I am always greatly pleased to participate in these debates and today we are obliged to respond to this Bloc motion , with which they are trying once again to cause instability .
when one is a member of the Bloc , things are easy .
today we are talking about harmonization , and , once again , the Bloc Quebecois is looking for a lifeline .
with all they have done in recent weeks , the issues of the biker gangs and drinking water , their flailing away in the water , they are looking for something to cling to .
they think they have found one more life raft to cling to called the harmonization of the GST and the QST , and they say they need compensation .
i am not an economist , but I know how to count .
in 1990 , the governments of Quebec and Canada announced they had signed an agreement .
in agreeing to harmonize , they realized over the years that revenues increased by over $ 2 billion .
you seek compensation because you have been misled .
you seek compensation because you have lost something .
perhaps they lost their credibility , but for sure Quebeckers gained a lot .
they started by setting up a Quebec sales tax .
this tax cost them over $ 1.3 billion .
what happened ?
harmonization was indeed a positive thing .
they are still going after the government , and we certainly know why they are .
why ?
simply because elections are coming up in Quebec .
they need to find ways to get elected .
what is in the PQ separatist stew every time ?
it is the federal government ' s fault .
in order to win votes , they say it is the federal government ' s fault .
we had a federal election in 1997 .
what happened ?
in 1997 , the Bloc Quebecois lost 500,000 votes and 11 seats .
if the Bloc were so strong , if it had the absolute truth , it would have won .
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
you lost your majority .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
we won in terms of votes and in terms of seats .
if an election were held tomorrow morning , the Bloc Quebecois - and I am quoting our friend Jean Lapierre , the former Bloc member , who says the Bloc has no reason to be in Ottawa - would take quite a beating .
it would disappear from the political map .
year in year out , they look for reasons to save their leader ' s political life .
they have to apologize .
they always have to say that errors of judgment were made .
we saw that .
on what was said about biker gangs , I personally would have been ashamed .
it is sad , so sad .
and when we get back to the economy , they show us once again that it is just a shot in the dark .
when we choose to protect the interests of Quebeckers and all Canadians , we can see that we are doing something positive .
why ?
because we have the figures to prove it .
i took some courses in economics .
my knowledge of macroeconomics tells me this is positive .
even editorialists agree .
however , when one has nothing to say , when one constantly tries to justify one ' s existence , we end up having to put up with things like this .
i find it most unfortunate .
the figures speak for themselves .
when Reformers take the floor , all Canadians start laughing .
flip - flaps , flap - flops , flip - flops , you name it , they do it all .
in 1992 the Reform changed its position again , saying that it would reduce the GST in stages after the budget was balanced .
in 1994 in the finance committee minority report on the GST the Reform Party supported harmonization .
i do not understand .
do you know why we have been elected ?
because we look after the interests of Canadians and we have a consistent policy .
when we all work together as partners with the Quebec government , when the separatist government understands that we have to co - operate in the interests of Canadians , we all benefit from it .
there is always room for improvement .
i hope we will keep on improving things , but , at some point , we have to stop talking about allegations and stick to the facts .
our policy has been effective .
later on , we will have to look for the means to make our businesses more competitive .
facts prove it : compensation would mean losses .
once more , Quebec has had a winning partnership with the federal government .
despite all the partisanship of the Bloc Quebecois , we realize one thing : when Canadians and Quebekers are given the facts , they understand that the federal government has looked after their best interests .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre , for questions and comments .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
madam Speaker , excuse me but I had said that I would share my time with the hon. member for -
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
yes , that is the information that was received by the Chair , and that is what was understood .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , I have a question for the hon. member .
he talked a great deal in his speech about inconsistency and hypocrisy on the part of others in the Chamber .
certainly when it comes to understanding the Reform Party there is some merit to his argument .
however , if we are talking about inconsistency , where there is the greatest question , it comes down to the Liberal Party .
now , four years later , it is still with us .
in fact it is being expanded and harmonized in terms of provincial sales tax in parts of the country .
how is it consistency in terms of Liberal policy when we have such obvious gaps and discrepancies in income tax policy and such unfairness in the whole system ?
how does the member find it consistent that we have a situation before us today whereby Revenue Canada has allowed a family trust of $ 2.2 billion in assets to be moved to the United States , thereby avoiding taxes ?
how is it consistent that we have today in Canada close to 8,000 Canadians with incomes over $ 100,000 paying no tax ?
how could it ever be consider consistent to have untaxed corporate profits amounting to somewhere in the neighbourhood of more than $ 41 million every day ?
how is it consistent to see such discrepancies in terms of the burden being shifted more and more to low and middle income Canadians and to see such wealthy individuals and such large corporations avoiding paying any taxes at all ?
Mr. Denis Coderre :
madam Speaker , I would like to know where the member was when we were grappling with the economic mess and succeeded in taking this country out of that slump .
we acted with transparency .
we were stuck with a $ 42 billion deficit .
we have a debt to control .
we acted responsibly and with speed and , moreover , we will reach a zero deficit in 1998 .
Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr 芒 ce - Lachine , Lib . ) :
once more , the Bloc is trying to convince Quebeckers that they are victims of Canadian federalism .
but Quebeckers are neither victims , as the Bloc claims they are , nor fools .
Quebeckers established a dynamic and strong society within the Canadian federation .
this explains why recent polls clearly show the failure of the separatists ' strategy based on lies and fairy tales .
the truth is the country we built together is an incomparable success , as is evidenced by the United Nations ' statistics that show , year after year , that Canada is the best country in the world to live in .
even on the issue of the financial advantages of federalism , the Bloc is mistaken when it describes Quebec as a loser .
the facts are clear .
let us start with today ' s motion .
this motion claims that Quebec is treated inequitably because it did not get billions of dollars as compensation for harmonizing its sales tax with the GST .
in this , the Bloc is echoing its provincial masters .
it espouses the position of the Parti Quebecois government .
but I would say to members of the Bloc that we are getting close to year 2000 and that in a couple , one member is no longer subject to the will of the other , nowadays .
the Quebec government referred to the assistance received by the harmonized Atlantic provinces , expressed in proportion to their populations , to justify its entitlement to adjustment assistance .
this wrongly implies that federal programs are structured in such a way .
however , as other speakers mentioned today , the fact remains that the only purpose of adjustment assistance is to compensate for part of the revenue shortfall experienced by some provinces after they agreed to participate in an harmonized sales tax system .
again , its only purpose is to compensate for part of the revenue shortfall , not for the revenue increase .
federal government programs are designed to meet the specific needs of each province and to take into account their particular situation , but not to distribute benefits equally among provinces on the basis of population .
thus , the equalization program is aimed at providing the provinces with a lower tax capacity with the resources they need to pay for high quality programs and services for their residents .
with this program , Quebec , which has less than 25 % of the population , will receive this year 48 % of total equalization payments , or $ 4 billion in federal transfers , when other provinces like Ontario , British Columbia and Alberta are not even eligible .
when faced with a particularly acute cigarette smuggling problem , Quebec asked the federal government to reduce its tobacco tax .
indeed , in giving Quebec what it wanted , the federal government lost revenues estimated at $ 300 million in all of Canada in 1994 - 95 .
Quebec also receive other benefits from the federal government .
i would like to enumerate a few .
companies established in Quebec receive about 40 % of research and development tax credits .
to date , 57 % of the funds invested by the Canadian technological partnership program went to Quebec companies .
thirty - seven percent of the Business Development Bank of Canada investments are concentrated in Quebec .
that is a significant contribution to the financing of small and medium size businesses in Quebec .
under the Canadian infrastructure program , the federal government gave $ 683 million to Quebec as its 33 % share of the cost of rehabilitating local infrastructure .
in closing , to go back to the issue of compensation for the harmonization of the GST , I will repeat that the adjustment assistance offered to the provinces , who needed it in their transition to a more effective sales tax system , was fair and equitable .
Quebec benefits greatly from several federal programs in areas where such assistance is needed .
with regard to the adjustment assistance program put in place as part of the harmonized sales tax system , the need obviously does not exist .
however , I remain convinced that Quebec ' s initiative to introduce a value added sales tax similar to the federal tax is legitimate and beneficial to both businesses and taxpayers .
we have convincing proof that federal programs are based on equitable rules .
when Quebec ' s needs and situation warrant federal assistance , such assistance is always provided and often exceeds the share that province should receive in proportion to its population .
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I would like to address a few comments to the members across the floor , particularly to the last two who spoke from the government side .
i think we have to consider a couple of things with what is being put forward with this motion .
we must recognize that in Canada today , through the democratic process , Quebec Canadians have elected the Bloc members who are here in the House .
there is something that has caused them to get frustrated to the point where they would choose to elect the Bloc members on this side of the House .
although I do not agree with the motion that has been put forward by the Bloc , I do recognize some of the frustration that Quebeckers feel with the current government .
i was interested in hearing some of the comments that members across the way made earlier in talking about the integrity of the Liberal government .
we heard the member misquote our leader .
he even said that the figures prove the Liberals ' good performance .
they come in here and with this litany of tax and debts , they hold up the UN ' s announcement of how we are the favoured nation and the chosen nation .
if we are the best of a bad lot , is that the best we can do ?
i say that Canada has a great potential to do even more than we have , but we are limited by the government to the point that Canadians in Quebec have become so frustrated that they are electing Bloc members .
i ask the member who spoke previously when will this government realize that Canadians are asking for lower taxes and some integrity in government instead of the misguided increased tax and mismanagement that we continue to see from this government ?
that is the crux of the question .
if we could have integrity and proper management of the fiscal issues in this country , perhaps we would not be faced with Bloc motions such as the one we are dealing with today .
Ms. Marlene Jennings :
madam Speaker , I have a hard time keeping a straight face .
when I listen to this member of the official opposition it makes me think that I am watching the film about Sybil .
i am not denigrating people who suffer from psychiatric disorders .
Sybil suffered from multiple personality disorder , which meant that each individual personality was not aware of what the other one was doing or saying .
here we have a party which has changed its position regarding GST numerous times , even before 1990 , and its members do not seem to remember each individual change .
how many times have they changed their position ?
let me count the times .
before 1990 they exploited public opposition to the GST to get two of their members elected to this House .
in 1991 the leader of their party reversed that position , saying it would not be repealed because that would increase the deficit , and yet in speeches he gave he talked about applying it to part of the debt .
anyone with a brain in their head knows that if you apply it to the debt it increases the amount of time the tax would be in force .
then in 1992 they changed their position again .
my God , how many times is that ?
Mr. Gilles - A .
madam Speaker , I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to the motion regarding the harmonization of the GST and the QST in Quebec .
the motion reads as follows :
that this House condemn the government for blatant unfairness to Quebec in the matter of the GST , the government having denied it compensation without letting it submit its arguments to an independent arbitration panel made up of three experts , the first to be appointed by the federal government , the second by the government of Quebec , and the third jointly by the first two .
the GST Act came into force on January 1 , 1991 .
as everyone knows , the federal government of the day implemented this new tax in great haste without a thorough analysis of its application , causing many technical difficulties .
today , this legislation is still criticized , mainly by small and medium size businesses which are forced to collect this tax for the federal government , thereby incurring considerable administrative costs .
a business must collect this 7 % tax from the consumer .
it is reimbursed through an input tax credit .
this tax credit may be requested by each individual in the production and distribution chain , with the result that it is the consumer , and the consumer alone , who pays the GST .
it would be normal and fair for the consumer to have some say over where his money goes , since he is well aware that the GST is a very important source of federal revenues .
we in Quebec were good sports .
we were the first to harmonize the tax , just as we were the first to defend Canada ' s interests in the free trade issue .
now that other provinces want to follow Quebec ' s lead and harmonize the GST , the federal government is getting generous .
speaking of the size of the cheque , in the interests of fairness , we in the Bloc Quebecois are suggesting through this motion that the federal government create a neutral arbitration panel , with one representative to be appointed by the federal government , one by the Quebec government , and one to be neutral .
one of the things this committee would be called upon to do is to work out the amount of this cheque .
imagine what the Government of Quebec would do with this $ 2 billion it has coming to it .
it is not difficult to arrive at a zero deficit with the methods used by our dear Minister of Finance ; all you have to do is cut social transfers to the provinces by 54 % and shamelessly dip into the employment insurance fund .
this money belongs to the unemployed and to the employers who contribute to it .
in fact , speaking of the employment insurance fund , we recommend strongly to the Minister of Finance that he lower the employment insurance premium rate from $ 2.90 to about $ 2.50 .
with these new rates , small and medium - sized businesses could , among other things , start investing in job creation .
even with these rates , the employment insurance fund surplus would allow the Minister of Human Resources Development to reevaluate the eligibility requirements for employment insurance .
yes , it would be interesting if the Minister of Finance , instead of digging directly or indirectly into the pockets of the less privileged in society , could respect the commitments he made in 1995 to reduce departmental expenditures by 19 % .
it is much easier for the government to act as it does than to tackle the real waste problem .
has this government really taken steps to stop waste ?
No. Think of the billion dollars that this government foolishly let slip from the state ' s coffers when it privatized our air traffic control system .
let me remind you of the facts .
the Minister of Finance himself had estimated our air traffic control system at $ 2.6 billion .
as for the Minister of Transport , he had estimated it at $ 2.4 billion .
so we can say that the average value of the air traffic control system is $ 2.5 billion .
speaking of young people , I must tell this House how appalled I am that in 1997 , children are going to school in the morning on an empty stomach .
this does not seem to sadden our Heritage Minister , when you consider how freely she is throwing our money to the wind .
in 1996 - 97 , this foolish initiative cost $ 15.5 million .
i will mention only that project , but I can tell you today that with all her useless programs , that minister has spent $ 94.6 million of the taxpayers ' money .
what a disgrace !
let us think about hungry children .
i cannot go on about this government ' s shameless wastefulness because it makes me ill .
before wasting money needlessly , let us think of all our people who are living in poverty .
i believe that any self - respecting government which is interested in making proper use of its taxpayers ' money should , before it spends money needlessly , get the go - ahead from all of its elected representatives , without any partisanship .
second , it ought to follow the recommendations of the auditor general to the letter .
we must not lose sight that the auditor general ' s function is to watch out for the taxpayer ' s interests .
third , all governments ought to follow the lead of the municipal governments and pass anti - deficit legislation .
fourth , they should reform the corporate tax structure so that it helps create jobs , and the personal income tax system so that it will be more equitable .
at the present time , we know that this supposedly sensible government is on the verge of spending hundreds of millions of dollars on helicopters without having the decency to reveal all the pertinent details of the purchase .
i am imploring the Minister of Public Works and Government Services to have the courage to break the chain and to consult his colleagues in the House before he issues a purchase order to the tune of several million dollars .
this would offer him a golden opportunity to practice what he preaches , the transparency of government operations .
indirectly , it is GST funds with which the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is allowing Guy Bertrand to take the case of the legitimacy of Quebec ' s sovereignty before the Supreme Court .
he and his colleague , the Minister of Justice , must put an end to this legal wrangling , which is costing the taxpayer a fortune .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
madam Speaker , on a point of order .
i will be happy to hear my colleague , but on the subject matter of the debate .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i would ask the hon. member to speak to the motion under consideration .
you may continue .
first , the hon. member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , on a point of order .
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
madam Speaker , I would ask my colleague of Bourassa himself to stick to the subject .
i listened to him and he did not say a word on the motion we moved .
the only thing he tried to do was to destroy the reputation of my colleagues and of the Bloc Quebecois and he talked about everything but the motion .
he should apply his remarks to himself .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
this is not a point of order .
the hon. member for Saint - Eustache - Sainte - Th 茅 r 猫 se has the floor .
Mr. Gilles - A .
madam Speaker , I will continue with my speech .
it must be remembered that in a democracy only a people has the right and the obligation to determine its future .
hon. members will understand that I am referring here to Bill C - 14 , a debate that will make us throw a lot of money down the drain .
i will end my speech by inviting all hon. members , without reference to their political allegiance , to strongly support this motion .
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , before I direct a question to the hon. member from the Bloc I want to say that I was very shocked to hear about the promises my Reform colleagues made .
i suggest once and for all that they come out with a solid position , quit changing their minds and quit being hypocritical with the Canadian people .
once again Bloc members are crying .
they are holding their hands out to the Government of Canada , " please give us billions of dollars '' .
the question they should answer for themselves is whether it is fair for Canadians to pay Quebeckers $ 2 billion , for that matter even one penny .
there has been no loss established .
in fact , there has been a gain .
i think members should ask themselves is it fair .
i think not .
it is hypocrisy .
the answer will be somewhat from a spoiled child .
is the answer fair ?
Mr. Gilles - A .
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I cannot help but sit here and chuckle over the word hypocrisy coming from the opposite ; hypocrisy , the finest word the government has every used and abused to the Canadian taxpayer .
it was not that long ago , but it is kind of short in the memories of some of the Liberal members , who had to resign their seat over the misrepresentation of the GST .
when we were debating the harmonization of the GST in the Atlantic provinces I can remember standing up in the House and giving a speech on the problems this would create in the Atlantic provinces .
i would like the hon. member from the Bloc to answer a question .
Mr. Gilles - A .
madam Speaker , in 1990 it was the party of Robert Bourassa that was in office .
Mr. Ghislain Fournier ( Manicouagan , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I was offended by the remarks of the member opposite , who thinks Quebec is a welfare case that does not pull its own weight and that we should not be asking for what is owed us .
as if we were asking for money that did not belong to us .
you cannot speak that way , sir .
it is an offence to Quebeckers .
i would be ashamed to speak that way , to speak such words in this House .
Mr. Gilles - A .
madam Speaker , I can understand the emotion and the indignation of my friend from Manicouagan .
i can understand how a person can rise and jump about a bit .
this is what happens when you hear all sorts of not very intelligent remarks in this House .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
it is my duty , pursuant to Standing Order 38 , to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve - tobacco act ; the hon. member for Sarnia - Lambton - trade .
the hon. member for Abitibi has the floor .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , we are speaking about a part of the Bloc Quebecois motion , which says :
that this House condemn the government for blatant unfairness to Quebec in the matter of the GST -
first of all , let us talk about the position of the Bloc Quebecois .
in its electoral platform , the Bloc said that Quebec , which chose a phased - in harmonization starting in 1991 , has not received the same compensation as the three maritime provinces , since Ottawa offered them $ 961 million as of April 1 , 1997 .
this quotation is from the householder published by Roger Pomerleau , the member for Anjou - Rivi 猫 re - des - Prairies .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
we fixed his fiddle .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
i will tell you this evening that there were several PQ members missing in the National Assembly .
as a Quebecker , I thought it was a unanimous vote by the Parti Quebecois in the National Assembly .
in his speech , the Minister of Revenue , Raymond Savoie , told the National Assembly :
the GST strikes me as a fairer tax because it is based on the consumption of goods and services .
and the more goods we consume and the more services we use , the more justified it is to opt for this method of taxation as opposed to the traditional one based strictly on revenue ratio .
there is another thing that should be pointed out about the GST , because we must go back to where it all began , in 1990 .
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
because it is not coming from your neck of the woods .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
when you lost the election in 1985 , the difference between the rate of taxation in Ontario and that in Quebec was 10.5 % - this is still 1990 - because today it is only 3.5 % and on the decrease .
it is steadily decreasing .
it was not the intention of the government in power at that time , the Liberal government , to obtain compensation .
they knew there was an agreement with Ottawa .
throughout the speech by the Quebec Minister of Revenue , he is careful to stress the notion of fairness .
we were guided by our wish to see that those with low incomes did not pay for this reform .
we were not going to foot the bill for this reform .
measures were introduced .
these people are getting refunds .
we never hear anything about that , but it is good for these people .
they tend to consume less that we do .
one thing should be said regarding the GST in Quebec , we are making changes , reducing it from 9 % to 8 % and to 7 % in 1992 .
the overall impact should be beneficial , good for democracy and I believe empowering , or at the very least advantageous for Quebec society as a whole .
one thing is very important , and that is that the minister took note of the change and really sought to be fair .
he noticed that the government was committed to the notion of economically advantageous mechanisms across North America and this is what this bill is all about .
this is why Mrs. Marois supported free trade .
one thing in this debate in the national assembly was very important , the vote .
when it took place , quite a few PQ members were absent .
but one thing should be said , according to my notes -
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅 :
could the member give us the list of those who were present ?
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
madam Speaker , if the hon. member wants to know who was there , I can send the list to his office .
i can tell you that I have the list of those in favour and those against .
not bad for a member in Ottawa .
it had become necessary to replace the federal sales tax .
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅 :
madam Speaker , on a point of order .
is the hon. member speaking on behalf of the Liberal Party or on behalf of the Conservative Party ?
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
madam Speaker , I could answer that some of his colleagues have been members of a communist party and , today , we do not know whether they are speaking for the Bloc Quebecois or for some communist party .
in agreeing to harmonize the two tax systems , Quebec was putting its economy in a better position to face competition from other provinces and other countries .
indeed , in reducing the cost of inputs and capital , it was making industries in the province more competitive .
there is also one thing we must talk about : the administration of the two taxes should be more efficient and less costly , both for business and for governments .
as a result of the agreement , retailers were finally going to enjoy more uniform tax rules and introduce a single accounting system and a centralized administration .
madam Speaker , you are telling me that my time is almost up .
i thought I had 20 minutes for my speech .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
you have 11 minutes left .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
do I have confirmation that I have 11 minutes left ?
thank you .
you see , this side also has learned to count .
the harmonization of Quebec ' s provincial tax with the GST was done in two stages .
thus , on January 1 , 1991 , the provincial tax base and the GST base were harmonized for personal goods , that is , personal property .
as of January 1 , I repeat , the base was extended .
it now includes services and personal property .
what happened on January 1 , 1992 ?
Quebec , our Quebec , the Quebec of Quebeckers , the Quebec of the Abitibi people , the Quebec of Canada - because my Canada also includes Quebec - started administering the GST collected on its territory .
in 1992 , the federal government helped Quebec take on new administrative functions - the opposition is quiet about that - by handing over the infrastructure , i . e . facilities and equipment , and providing $ 20 million over three years toward start up .
we know that several million dollars worth of facilities and equipment were involved .
in addition , federal employees were offered comparable positions within the provincial public service .
we know that people in the Quebec provincial public service are very well paid .
they are in a very good position to do good work .
both governments share on an equal basis the cost of administering the sales tax .
members opposite often throw figures like $ 1 billion , $ 1,000 million , $ 2 billion , but now we are going to have the real figures .
when discussing sales tax revenue , it is important to known the real figures .
they are all there .
the figures provided by Quebec officials tell us that , since 1990 - 91 , the province received $ 3.463 billion , for an average increase of 11.3 % .
Quebec is once again using the obsolete federal estimate of $ 4.8 billion regarding the revenues generated by a harmonized sales tax , instead of the revised amount of $ 4.575 million .
so , what do we make of the inaccurate statements found primarily in Quebec ' s public accounts , particularly on page 218 ?
it is important to know these facts .
the Quebec government uses the argument that the $ 961 million compensation to the maritime provinces is equivalent to $ 423 per capita , while the compensation claimed by Quebec amounts to $ 273 per capita .
this comparison does not make any sense , since compensation is not at all calculated on a per capita basis .
this is where the Bloc Quebecois is mistaken , when it refers to $ 961 million .
these arguments are only based on the total provincial losses of sales tax revenues following harmonization .
do you know where the Bloc Quebecois ' mistake come from as regards the $ 961 million ?
it comes from the fact that , in Quebec , government expenditures increased much more rapidly than federal transfers .
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini 猫 re , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I do not know what to say about this confused , distorted and erroneous lesson in history .
you know , I really wondered where the hon. member for Abitibi was living today .
was he living in the past , in the present or in the future ?
was he talking like a Conservative or a Liberal ?
at times , I could picture him here , or in his riding , even at the National Assembly .
figures were quoted to us , right and left .
it only goes to reinforce our request .
on the contrary , we will fight and we will get our $ 2 billion in GST .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
madam Speaker , I have a lot of respect for the hon. member .
i know that the hon. member for Lotbini 猫 re has a lot of respect for Quebec , but I hope he has some respect for the National Assembly .
what I have received today is the truth ; it does not contain any error .
the figures I quoted came for the province of Quebec and contain no mistake .
based on the assumption that the taxes would have been fully harmonized by 1990 , and according to the formula applied to all of the provinces , Quebec , just like Ontario , Alberta and British Columbia , would not be entitled to any adjustment assistance .
throughout the process , the Canadian government was very transparent .
i think it is important to point that out .
the hon. member talked about errors being made and said that we received this information back in February .
the rules are the same for everyone and the results are fair to all the provinces , in this area as on all the other issues where , very often , Quebec is a big winner , just like Jacques Villeneuve .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I would like to ask a question to the hon. member for Abitibi .
he just told us that there were figures transmitted between Quebec and Ottawa officials , that everybody was getting along fine and that there was no problem .
where did he get that ?
the last figures laid on the table deal with a $ 2 billion claim from the Quebec government stating that the federal government has shown blatant unfairness to Quebec in the matter of GST harmonization .
he can quote any old figures he wants - and he did come up with just about any old figures - the fact remains that , when looking at the tax structure before and after harmonization , when taking into account the need for Quebec to increase corporation taxes because the federal government did not give it any compensation , one can see there has been a cost , and this cost has been assessed and duly , seriously , calculated by the Quebec government and by the officials , and also endorsed by a consensus arrived at by every Quebec participant in the economic summit of last year .
it has been endorsed also by the Canadian premiers at the St. Andrews conference .
there comes a time when we have to stop talking nonsense here .
there is a $ 2 billion claim on the table , there are formulas , there are cost assessments that have been made , and now we are asking that an objective panel review our figures and those of the finance minister .
he should understand that .
that is not hard to understand .
if there is something simple for him to understand , it is that an objective , non partisan panel can make a serious analysis whereas he says just about anything .
he should understand that .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I am trying to be fair .
i received these figures today .
we never know when the opposition will present a motion .
we learn about it in the morning when we get up with the chickens , at 5.30 a.m.
the member said : " I do not understand the member across the way '' .
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
you do not understand a thing .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
in 1990 - I am giving you the background , it is important - on December 14 , 1990 , people accepted the GST in the National Assembly .
they have a majority .
i can tell you that when Quebec ' s needs or situation require it , the federal government is always there to give its financial support to our people , the people of Quebec , the people of Abitibi .
some hon. members :
down with the GST .
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , I will be sharing by time with my colleague for Winnipeg North Centre .
i do not know if I will be using all of my 10 minutes .
what I have to say about the HST will not take ten minutes .
we must look at what is going on in New Brunswick and in the other Atlantic provinces .
it is interesting to hear the Reform members and the government members talk about hypocrisy .
i would say that if you put two cats in the same bag , only one will come out .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
Ms. Angela Vautour :
the Liberals had promised to get rid of the GST .
in my province , instead of getting rid of the GST , we ended up with a tax that makes no sense .
we have low income families who now must pay 15 % on diapers , 15 % on electricity , and those people are not getting any compensation as was mentioned a few moments ago .
we must look at how much these people are paying and how little they are getting in the end .
while a mother is paying 15 % more for diapers , the person who has money and who wants to buy a $ 45,000 car is paying less .
this is not my idea of justice .
to me , this is just another tax on the poor , and the rich are paying less once again .
that is the Liberal way .
it is clear .
this morning , I was in the human resources development committee , and even senior officials in the department were saying that Atlantic Canada was affected the most by unemployment insurance reform , by the fact that no jobs are being created in our region .
and we are hit by this tax on top of all that .
we are the provinces who pay the most for a stamp in this country .
in the regions , where there are no jobs , there are no longer any programs to help people .
there are Liberals in this House who are really proud of what they are doing .
i think they should be ashamed of themselves .
we have to look at what the tax really brings .
there are people who have no more money to buy things and this affects our merchants .
our small and medium size businesses are really affected by the BST - and we have a good definition for this BST where I come from .
an hon. member :
could you tell me what it is ?
Ms. Angela Vautour :
we are not allowed to say such things in this place .
i think we really have to go see what happened .
the Liberals criticized the Conservatives .
they got elected on the GST , really .
they came back and said " Yes , yes , the deficit was bigger '' .
first things first , the deficit - that has to be settled right away .
who has paid down the deficit ?
it is the unemployed , it is old people , it is students , people without jobs , people receiving social assistance .
those are the people who paid down the deficit .
i do not see any large corporations in this country that put a lot of money on the deficit .
but nobody mentions that .
i congratulate these people .
each time I have the opportunity I congratulate them for having paid down the deficit because without the underprivileged in this country , it would have never been paid down .
the government did not look elsewhere to pay for it .
so the people from the Atlantic region are very disappointed with the GST or the BST .
it was just another tax .
they say they are not increasing taxes , but people are paying 8 % more for electricity and heating .
it is not a tax .
they did not increase taxes .
i would not want them to admit that they increased them .
it is very sad , in our regions , when we see the rate of unemployment and the rate of poverty , and when on top of that , we have a government that imposes such a tax on us .
this is unacceptable .
our businesses are being affected .
the number of personal and commercial bankruptcies continues to rise , and this has to stop .
so I do not have to take 10 minutes to tell you that the GST stinks for me and its stinks for the majority of the people in New Brunswick and the Atlantic region .
only Prince Edward Island escaped from this .
it is true that there was a bribe .
it is true that the former Premier of New Brunswick hurried to collect his $ 1 billion in taxes in an attempt to save the face of the Liberal government .
it is us , the people from the Atlantic region .
it is always the people who have a hard time making ends meet .
so I will end on that .
people in the three Atlantic provinces that have the BST are very upset .
it is a very unfair tax .
it is the people at the lowest scale of income who are paying the most .
they are paying tax on electricity .
they are paying 15 % tax on children ' s clothing starting from the first dollar .
however , if you buy an article that is over $ 93 , you will pay less .
they buy just the necessities but they are the ones paying the most because of the blended sales tax .
on behalf of the people that I represent , I want it on the record that we are very disappointed in the Liberal government for their broken promises and a tax that is very unfair to the people of my riding and the Atlantic provinces .
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have listened to the hon. member and I sympathize with her .
when the tax was debated in the House I remember speaking against the BST being introduced in the Atlantic provinces .
many things were said by the government .
actually , its members were the official opposition when the GST was brought in .
the minister of finance said at that time that the goods and services tax was a stupid , inept , incomplete and incompetent tax .
all through the debate today we have heard about hypocrisy .
i would think that this is the height of it .
now we have the Prime Minister saying it is his personal tax and how much he loves it .
when he leaves the country and talks to other leaders around the world , he brags about how he introduced it and not the Conservatives .
i know the hon. member was not in the House during the time of the BST and the debate in this House .
i wish she had been here .
perhaps we would have had more help .
i do not recall hearing from her party at that time .
i would like to know if anybody from the east has put into dollars and cents how much the blended sales tax has really cost the people back home .
Ms. Angela Vautour :
Mr. Speaker , I do not have the figures with me but I can say , on a humane basis , that the figure is very high .
that is the important part .
it may be millions or billions .
the important part is that the people from low income families are paying through the nose because of this tax .
that is the only thing that is important .
it is a very unfair tax that makes lower income people pay more again .
that is what concerns me and my people .
Mr. Ghislain Fournier ( Manicouagan , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate the hon. member for Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac who , unlike Liberal members opposite , has impressed me a great deal with her respectful , intelligent and heartfelt remarks .
she spoke with great humanity .
i congratulate her .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member for Bourassa on a point of order .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
Mr. Speaker , the House should know that each time the Bloc speaks nonsense and accuses the government of belittling Quebec , well , it is not Quebec we belittle , but Bloc Quebecois members .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
that is not a point of order .
it is a point of debate .
the hon. member for Manicouagan .
Mr. Ghislain Fournier :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member opposite shows a lack of respect .
he should know that we are legitimately elected representatives of Quebeckers .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
we will give the hon. member for Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac a few minutes to wrap up before we proceed to the next speaker .
Ms. Angela Vautour :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for his kind words .
it is true that respect is sorely lacking in the House .
it is something that can be felt by outsiders .
i hope it will get better over time .
this House is not necessarily known for its respect for people .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to participate in the debate on the opposition motion sponsored by the Bloc concerning the GST and the harmonized sales tax .
i understand its reasons for putting forward this motion and the kinds of concerns that have been raised .
it is putting us all in an interesting position to debate the unfairness of some changes to a measure that is inherently unfair to begin with .
as my colleague indicated in her comments , we are really discussing how two wrongs can make a right .
it is important for us to deliberate on the very question of the need to introduce the GST by first the Conservatives and then the Liberals .
i will raise a couple of points in this discussion .
the GST is a very regressive tax measure .
that has been enunciated by a number of other speakers .
as we all know , unlike all other sales taxes , corporations do not pay the GST .
we are widening the gap between the haves and the have nots , creating an ever - widening gap between those who are struggling day by day to make ends meet and those who are enjoying an incredible amount of profits , dividends and luxury .
the people in our society today who need a break , some real tax relief , are the hard working women and men who have been trying desperately to make ends meet as real wages keep falling .
what we are dealing with , and we have all experienced this for a number of years , is a tax measure that makes it even harder for those ordinary working women and men to make ends meet , who are forever left asking the question " Why is there so much month left at the end of the money ? "
we are not only dealing with an inherently unfair tax , whether we are talking about the GST , or the BST or any other terminology that describes this harmonized sales tax , but we are also talking about a tax measure that was introduced in a most dishonest way .
we know the idea originated with the Conservatives .
Canadians will never forget that it was the Conservative government that forced the GST through even though at that time fewer than 10 % of Canadians supported it .
what did the Liberals do after making those strong statements ?
they did a double take .
that whole move to harmonize , to blend , the GST with provincial sale taxes , if applied across this country , represents a shift of another $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion of the tax burden from corporations to people .
as we know from the debate today , families in Atlantic Canada and Quebec are suffering very much from this policy .
by breaking their commitment , by breaking their word , the Prime Minister and other Liberals in this Parliament abandoned an opportunity to make Canadian families better off .
speaking of inconsistencies and shifting positions , let us not forget to mention the position of the Reform Party .
reform members are standing in this House today expressing concern about the GST , raising concerns about the whole debate we are having today with respect to the blending of sales taxes .
it was the Reform Party that said in this House in 1994 in a report on the GST that the Liberal Party was to be congratulated on its attempts to harmonize the GST with provincial sales taxes .
it was the Reform Party at that time that recommended that consumption taxes should be levied on the broadest possible base .
this of course would mean extending the GST to food , to medication and nursing home charges .
Canadians were hoodwinked on this issue .
our opportunity today is to suggest to the Liberal government particularly that there is an alternative to this kind of regressive tax policy .
there are alternatives available to this government for both collecting necessary revenues and ensuring a measure of fairness in our tax collection system .
i raise in particular one such proposal since it is very much in the news currently and very much represents the unfairness in our system today .
in about a month ' s time a group entitled Project Loophole will bring a matter to the courts pertaining to the fact that in 1991 Revenue Canada ruled that one family trust could transfer $ 2.2 billion in assets to the United States without paying taxes .
that raised a whole lot of questions about how many other family trusts are being provided this option .
how much money earned here as a result of hardworking Canadians is being moved out of the country without taxes being paid ?
how much profit is being earned by corporations and wealthy individuals without contributing to the tax base of this country ?
that is but one example of the unfairness in our tax system and the need for this government to look seriously at alternatives to the GST and the BST .
we are talking about people under financial stress searching for meaningful work , trying to combine two and three part time jobs just to make ends meet everywhere in this country , being faced ever and ever with a burden that is just beyond their reach and beyond human capacity for responding to .
Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr 芒 ce - Lachine , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is quite interesting listening to the hon. member opposite discussing the motion , but it does not sound like she was discussing the motion .
i would like to know if she supports the merits by the Bloc ' s contention .
does the member agree with the Bloc motion that Quebec is owed $ 2 billion as a result of having harmonized Quebec sales tax with the goods and services tax .
that is the motion .
i would like to hear from the member on that .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis :
Mr. Speaker , with all due respect to the Liberal member opposite , I believe I have answered the question .
i indicated from the outset that two wrongs do not make a right .
we are dealing with an unfair regressive tax measure to begin with .
the blending of the GST with provincial tax does not make it any better .
we would work to immediately to remove GST from books , magazines and family essentials like children ' s clothing .
we would phase out the GST in the context of comprehensive tax reform .
that kind of package is workable .
it provides a real alternative to the Liberal government .
i would heartily ask for their support for this kind of alternative .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I always have a little trouble following the NDP ' s arguments .
i understand that they are bleeding hearts and they are all for motherhood and apple pie .
i would like to mention two facts , however .
the first is that we have seen the results of the NDP government in Ontario .
it was an expensive lesson to the people of Ontario .
the NDP supposedly represented social justice , but we saw what it cost .
Mr. Grant McNally :
British Columbia , as well .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
British Columbia , as well .
does she share the views of the premiers of British Columbia and Saskatchewan on harmonization ?
and , if they are not in touch , they should pick up the telephone a little more often .
what is happening , Mr. Speaker ?
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis :
Mr. Speaker , I think the member does a great disservice to the vast majority of Canadians who share our concerns when it comes to the government ' s very regressive tax policies .
i remind the Liberal member that at the time the government was promising to abolish the GST after having seen the effects of it under the Conservatives , only 10 % of Canadians thought it had any possibility of benefiting the economy .
ninety per cent of Canadians knew at the time how harmful such a tax would be on ordinary working men and women .
those are the people already feeling tremendous unfairness in our tax system , where the burden has shifted so much from corporations and individuals to the shoulders of low and middle income Canadians .
the comments I made today dealt specifically with the needs of children who may not have mothers or fathers .
of course we support them .
we will stand up any day to support the needs of survivors and the needs of children without parents .
i hope the member opposite would share in standing up for such individuals .
i end by saying this issue is not narrowly defined and it does not affect a few people .
it affects the vast majority of Canadians who want to see change .
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I sat through this debate today as did the other members in the House .
quite frankly I am a little exhausted , extremely exhausted , with the partisan rhetoric and the comments from the government side and the opposition side .
perhaps if we could have a bit of attention we can set the record straight .
the comments of the Reform Party leave me perplexed .
the member for Portage - Lisgar and the member for Calgary Southeast have both stated that the Reform Party would get rid of the GST .
that is shocking .
i want the explanation .
i would like to see the numbers .
let us go back to this little history lesson .
the history lesson is very simple .
we were in a situation in this country where we were looking at having free trade with the Americans .
our companies which exported to the U.S. were penalized 13 % on everything they sent across the border .
the only way we could have growth in this country , the only way we could have any possibility of a fair and level playing field to bring in free trade was to get rid of the manufacturers sales tax .
this is a simple lesson in economics .
therefore the GST was brought in to replace the manufacturers sales tax .
we could continue to gather revenue .
we could continue to pay down the deficit .
some day we could even think about tackling the debt .
is that the way we are headed ?
i question the wisdom .
an hon. member :
no partisan stuff coming from over there .
Mr. Gerald Keddy :
what I am saying is very partisan and I am not a bit ashamed that it is partisan .
of course it is partisan .
i will tell you what else , it makes sense .
you cannot go out there and tell Canadians you are going to get rid of the GST and not think you are going to replace it with something .
you are not going to pay down the debt overnight by snapping your fingers .
it takes a plan and it takes action .
you have to have both .
they thought it was a good idea .
we had to have free trade .
now they want to get rid of it .
let us be practical .
there has been enough time wasted on rhetoric here today .
we have listened to the NDP , we have listened to all the parties , and there is no replacement here .
there is no magic here .
there are a lot of hard decisions to be made and that is all .
part of it is that this country has to continue to move forward , and moving backward is not moving forward .
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner ( Portage - Lisgar , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I really enjoyed those comments and I would like to be educated a little further .
i know the Conservatives really believe in cost cutting .
they paid for 212 Conservative members for two terms and then they only paid for two members .
what kind of a plan do you have to follow to do that ?
that really helped us here in the House .
that relieved the debtload quite a bit .
what do we have to do to follow that plan ?
i would like the formula .
Mr. Gerald Keddy :
madam Speaker , unfortunately there was quality and substance and it did not get replaced with quality and substance .
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I appreciated listening to the comments from the hon. member to the right .
i know he was not here from 1984 to 1993 , but his former colleagues were given a strong mandate by the people of Canada to get the House in order and to take some fiscal responsibility with the country .
however they continued in the same vein as the previous government they replaced .
in fact they went from such large numbers to two , as my hon. colleague mentioned , because of that .
my hon. colleague mentioned a plan of action .
his former colleagues were given a plan of action and they did not follow through on it and were reduced to two members .
i just have to ask my hon. colleague how it is that he can talk about the policy of our party when in fact they are not willing to even look at the information and see what it is .
to hear half truths and to say something does not mean that it is going to become true .
i would just ask my hon. colleague to take a look at the information and make an informed decision because that is what Canadians across the country are doing .
that is what is happening .
take a look at the numbers in the House , my hon. colleague , in your caucus and in this caucus .
then we will see what will happen in the next four years .
i will just wrap up my comments and question by asking the regional party to the right what it is that it would propose to do to alleviate taxation in this country and to stimulate the economy .
what is its plan because it did not do anything in the nine years it was here previously .
Mr. Gerald Keddy :
madam Speaker , the answer is very quick , very simple and to the point .
where is the plan ?
we are living the plan today .
the success of this country today is directly from free trade .
however , it is not their policy , it is Tory policy that is already in place and here .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , am I to understand , and I am sure I did not just hear this , that we are all benefiting in this country and basking in the glory of parties past because of all of the good things they have done for us ?
i know it is hard for people watching this to understand , but I just wanted to get a clarification from this party from Jurassic Park over here .
does the hon. member truly believe that we are basking in the sunshine of the Tories and Liberals past ?
is the sunshine in the order of $ 600 billion worth of debt ?
Mr. Gerald Keddy :
madam Speaker , repetition becomes boring after a while .
obviously the member did not listen to the answer the last time .
the success of the country today is based 100 % on the fact that the Conservatives brought in free trade .
we had to bring in free trade .
it is the policies that were put in place that allowed the deficit to be cut .
that is not a tough equation .
take a look at it .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , if it is Jurassic Park it is not for me .
we already have a Star Wars trilogy because it is from another planet too .
when someone tries to take credit , and we know that there was a deficit of $ 42 billion when we came to office , and that their economic policy was to bump up the deficit by $ 10 or $ 12 billion annually , I think he should watch those films .
there will have to be another sequel .
Mr. Gerald Keddy :
madam Speaker , I am not sure but I think I may have just heard the member refer to the economic upswing the country is in , to low inflation and low interest rates .
i think he was obliquely taking credit for it .
i think he had better back up a little bit and look at who put those policies in place and understand why he is able to take credit for them today .
the Prime Minister may take credit for free trade and the GST , but low inflation , a better economy and low interest rates did not happen overnight .
and they did not happen from policies which have come in since 1993 either .
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I am hearing this litany of all the wonderful things we have to be thankful for in this country .
i wonder , do these include in the hon. member ' s opinion an unemployment rate above 9 % for the past eight years , a $ 600 billion debt and record bankruptcies .
is this , in his opinion , the glory , the success of the two old parties ?
Mr. Gerald Keddy :
madam Speaker , I spoke in the simplest terms I could find .
i reached back as far as I could to put it in the Reform style mantra , that ABC type of thing that they like .
i have explained it as best I can .
i cannot explain it any more .
along with that there has been an increase in the business climate and the economy of the nation .
we do have unacceptable unemployment , absolutely .
something needs to be done about it , a lot more than just talking about it .
we have to take some action .
an hon. member :
but you did not do anything about it .
Mr. Gerald Keddy :
i can repeat it one more time and then maybe we can put it to bed .
free trade was brought in by one party .
that allowed economic growth .
it drove the manufacturing sector of this nation .
it allowed this country to benefit from low interest rates , from low unemployment , from low inflation that we have today .
if it had not been for that , we would have been in three or four times worse shape than we are in now .
Mr. Murray Calder ( Dufferin - Peel - Wellington - Grey , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , there is a very interesting debate going on over there .
it is quite comical .
i am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate and to describe the many ways that Quebec benefits from the actions of the Government of Canada and especially from the social spending benefits that Quebec gets .
one of the most obvious benefits is being part of the country that the United Nations has recognized as the best place in the world to live .
as Canadians and Quebeckers this is a shared privilege , one that we can all be proud of .
canada is a respected member of the G - 7 , of the OECD , of NAFTA , of APEC and other international organizations .
membership in these important organizations provides Canadians with the commercial linkages that are necessary for success in a competitive global economy .
this is something that benefits all Canadians and especially Canadian companies doing business in world markets .
the Minister of Human Resources Development recently attended a meeting of employment and labour ministers of 29 countries of the Organization for Economic Co - operation and Development .
at that meeting his colleagues from these other countries referred to Canada as the Canadian miracle .
our ability to meet the challenges of economic , political and social change that so many others are going through is quite remarkable and has added to Canada ' s international strength and reputation .
at the federal level we have been successful in restoring the nation ' s finances .
the deficit this government inherited will be eliminated no later than 1998 - 99 .
the Canadian dollar is sound .
there is a feeling of confidence and optimism in the national economy .
Quebeckers have been major beneficiaries of these positive developments through lower interest rates for mortgages and consumer loans , as well as in many other ways in business and improved prospects for export sales .
because of the dramatic improvement in our financial situation , we have regained some flexibility in our social program planning .
one of the most significant examples of this is the national child benefit that was presented in the last federal budget .
this novel idea is an example of a new style of Canadian federalism that works .
all levels of government of every political stripe are working together to bring forward a new social program to help children and their families .
this may be the most important new program of this generation .
there will be many potential benefits for the people of Quebec .
the mechanics are simple .
the Government of Canada will increase the federal child tax credit and thus the income of low income families .
this will reduce demands for social assistance payments at the provincial and territorial level .
each province or territory can then take its savings in social assistance and reinvest them in programs and services to directly help parents on social assistance move into employment , and low income working families to stay in the labour force .
thus each province will have new money freed up to use for its special needs .
under the program as it is now conceived , beginning in July 1998 Quebec will have the use of an additional $ 150 million to provide programs and services directly to Quebeckers .
this program shares the same objectives as the family policy proposed by Quebec and it will help Quebec to implement it .
the national child benefit is good for Quebec families and children , but the Government of Quebec so far has opposed it .
fortunately , Quebeckers are able to fully participate in the national employment insurance program and are among its major beneficiaries .
the legislation passed by this House one year ago to set up the new employment insurance system introduced several new measures to improve the employability of Canadians .
for example , a system of targeted wage subsidies was introduced to encourage employers to hire EI claimants by offsetting a portion of their wages .
we expect this will help some 8,000 Canadians to gain valuable on the job experience this year and many of these will be Quebeckers .
the new EI program also includes a self - employment assistance component to support unemployed individuals who want to start their own businesses .
an estimated 6,000 new entrants will be supported under this part of the program this year , and many of them will be Quebeckers .
some 35,000 are taking training courses while receiving EI benefits , and many of these are Quebeckers .
it is clear that Quebeckers are benefiting very much from the new EI program .
of the $ 880 million that will be reinvested annually in active employment measures across Canada , by the year 2002 about $ 252 million , almost one - third , will be going to Quebec .
we are also concerned about providing support for areas of the country where unemployment is high and where jobs are hard to find .
in these areas employment insurance eligibility requirements are the lowest and the benefit entitlements are the highest .
a number of these special areas are in Quebec .
we have introduced the transitional jobs plan to work with local partners to invest together in creating lasting jobs in high unemployment areas .
at the national level about 400 transitional job fund projects have been approved and 188 of them are in Quebec .
there have been 22,500 jobs created and 14,500 of them are in Quebec .
the Government of Canada has invested a total of $ 158 million in these projects to date , $ 81 million of it is in Quebec .
the objective of the transitional job fund is to lever other source funds to create long lasting employment in high unemployment areas .
it has proven to be a very useful program for employers and workers in the province of Quebec .
i refer to the labour market agreement that was signed by the governments of Quebec and Canada earlier this year .
that is a historical agreement , a major change in the way things are being done in the federation .
over the next five years we estimate that the Government of Canada will have made available more than $ 2.7 billion to Quebec under the labour market agreement .

the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the House will now proceed to consideration of Private Members ' Business as listed on today ' s Order Paper .
private MEMBERS ' BUSINESS
madam Speaker , I believe this bill is before us today because as members of this House we are truly concerned with the need to improve the safety and security of our citizens .
this bill was not my idea .
it is a product of many discussions between police officers and politicians across the country .
i hope to be able to influence members of the House enough so that we get this bill into committee .
i do hope members opposite do not take the view that this is already law because it is not .
police officers in all of our ridings need our help on this issue .
i will explain why .
but first we should know that many politicians look at new ideas and ask , why ?
good politicians should look at new ideas as a challenge and say , why not ?
that is where we are today .
i will first explain what Bill C - 211 does .
the bill establishes that a police officer may arrest without warrant , detain and bring before a justice a person the officer reasonably believes is in breach of a condition of a bail or a probation order , a condition of a conditional sentence or a condition of statutory release , parole or unescorted temporary absence .
why is this necessary ?
most of us understand the rationale of what it takes to get a warrant for arrest .
it is difficult and it is time consuming .
that is to say the least .
it is abundantly clear that such a pedophile will not stay in that area very long knowing full well that a policeman is on his track .
to try to apprehend a pedophile on a release , on conditions , who is at a playground by getting a warrant signed by a judge somewhere in a community is just unreasonable to expect .
the outcome of such a story unfortunately is all too often the same .
the police do not apprehend the individual who is breaking the condition because they do not have a warrant .
they know they cannot get it fast enough and the criminal gets away .
worse yet , in many cases , some unsuspecting person becomes a victim .
our police need our help and understanding , not our fighting .
let us get this bill to a committee and have the police speak to it .
they will tell us all in the justice committee exactly what the problems are .
we will surely hear stories that will shake Canadians across the country .
we are today in a situation where I have police coming to me describing time and time again situations that are happening .
let me give some of the conditions imposed that a police officer may operationally find himself confronting when the officer encounters an offender in our community during the course of his duties .
in the course of a policeman ' s duties , he may respond to calls of service , traffic enforcement , field interviews , all those sorts of things that a policeman does in his everyday business .
obey the law and keep the peace : they often find a person on UTA in a fight .
if a person does not have it on them , what do the police do ?
they have to get a warrant .
they have to say " Excuse me , would you wait here for six hours ?
i will be back '' .
it just does not work .
a person on UTA cannot own , possess or have control of any weapon as defined in section 2 of the Criminal Code , except as authorized by a parole supervisor .
a person on UTA has to abstain from the use of alcohol .
this happens in my community many times where a person out on a temporary absence or out from one of the many prisons we have in my area - at least seven federal and something like 10 provincial - is found in a bar .
they know they are not supposed to be there .
it is not rational for a policeman to say " Just hang on there .
don ' t drink .
stay there .
i ' ll be back in a little while '' .
the reason the condition is put on that person in the first place is because that person got into trouble and ended up in a prison because they were drinking .
what happens when the policeman goes ?
typically , the individual gets into trouble and it is an unsuspecting individual who is on the wrong end of the stick .
another condition for a person on UTA is submitting to a breathalyzer on demand of a peace officer where reasonable grounds exist to believe the offender is breaching a condition of abstinence from alcohol or abstaining from the use of drugs other than prescribed medication and over the counter drugs .
non - communication with specified individuals .
another condition is not to own or operate a motor vehicle .
these conditions go on and on but I wanted to give the House an idea of all of the restraints or conditions that are on people who come out of prison where a police officer is basically hamstrung because he needs a warrant to arrest .
for example , an offender is released on parole with a condition to abstain from alcohol .
some of these examples actually have been given to me by police operating in this country .
during contact with the police , the offender is found to be intoxicated , a direct violation of his parole .
the police officer has no authority to arrest the offender as a result of the condition of breach .
instead , the offender ' s parole supervisor must be notified .
the parole may be suspended and then the police officer may take action if the offender is subsequently located again and arrested on the authority of a warrant issued pursuant to sections 118 , 135 or 136 of the Canada Corrections Act .
members can see why policemen basically look at the situation and say " I just can ' t get a warrant " and this is going to happen .
it is in the process of happening so no action can be taken .
in the meantime , the offender has posed a risk to the community , say most police .
to further frustrate the situation , the offender may have to submit to a breathalyzer on demand .
if the offender is intoxicated and is demanded to submit to a breathalyzer but refuses , the police officer has no immediate authority to take the offender into custody .
peace officers are given the responsibility to protect life and property , prevent crime , apprehend criminals and enforce the law .
a peace officer may arrest a person and assist in the prosecution of that person .
where the offence is disposed of by conviction , there are several avenues open to the court in dealing with the person .
if the person is placed on probation various conditions may be imposed on the person .
section 495 of the conditional release act permits the arrest of the person , without warrant , when a peace officer finds the person breaching any of the conditions of probation .
however , an offender who is convicted and sentenced to a term of incarceration in a penitentiary , which is generally reserved for those more serious offences and repeat offences , may subsequently be released into the community with conditions .
ironically , many of these conditions of release are similar to the conditions of probation .
however , a peace officer has no authority to apprehend the offender whom the peace officer finds in violation of the condition .
they can be actually very similar to the conditions of probation , yet they can arrest .
i talked to a young policeman in my riding , Mike Novakowski , who will be receiving a meritorious award for working so hard on this particular bill .
he gives me this example .
he gives this example .
if a person steals a chocolate bar from a grocery store and is charged and convicted of theft , it is not uncommon that when the person is sentenced they are placed on probation .
when the person violates a condition of their probation and is caught by the police , police may arrest the person without a warrant and detain that person according to the law .
that person may be charged and convicted of an additional crime , which is breach of probation .
however , says Mike , if a person is charged and convicted of aggravated sexual assault and is sentenced to a penitentiary , he or she may be released prior to expiration of the sentence on parole , on statutory release or unescorted temporary absence with conditions .
if that person violates a condition of that release and is caught by the police , the police may not arrest that person without a warrant .
canada corrections must make an after the fact judgement , issue a warrant and then that warrant may subsequently be executed by police .
i know what I might hear from the other side , that this can be taken care of through other routes .
that is what I am trying to explain .
the other routes are going to Canada corrections , trying to get action taken for the particular situation the police are in and perhaps they might get a warrant or an after the fact judgement .
the problem is you could be dealing with , in many cases are dealing with in my community , pedophiles , sexual offenders .
policemen cannot wait and even expect the convict , the offender , to stay there while they fetch a warrant .
it is unreasonable to even ask .
the purpose of this bill is to protect our citizens even more by helping our police .
this is really , and should be , a non - partisan issue in this House , an issue that can be resolved with the help of my colleagues .
there are no financial implications to this bill and no inappropriate power given to our police officers ; just more protection for you , me and our families as a Canadian people .
i know in this House that private members bills are an interesting subject and the subject of much debate .
there is much controversy with private members bills because many of us believe they do not go anywhere unless the cabinet agrees .
many private members bills are not votable .
those that are seem to end up dying after second reading .
if they get to committee we seldom see them get out of committee and return to the House for report stage and third reading .
i recall very few bills which have been successful .
these bills would help ordinary Canadians .
the motivation behind this bill did not come from a politician , it came from the police .
they are asking for our assistance .
i have seen bills enter this House which most people in Canada do not relate to in any way .
quite frankly , they could not care less .
i guess I was a little naive at that time .
i thought that when we all accepted it in the House it would go somewhere .
several million Canadians were hoping that one day they would see a national victims bill of rights .
we had a great debate in the House that day .
everybody agreed with it .
it got stuck somewhere in committee .
parliament was dissolved for an election and the bill died on the order paper .
no one on the government side resurrected it .
we had an interesting discussion in the House the other day when we debated a private member ' s bill on drunk driving .
it was a votable motion put forward by the Reform Party .
my concern at the time was what was going to happen next .
everybody in the House agreed with it .
where will it go ?
what assurances do we have when these bills go to committee that they will be put into effect ?
constable Novakowski , an Abbotsford policeman , put a lot of work into this bill .
he did a lot of research .
he and his colleagues believe in the House .
they believe in what we are doing .
they believe we can effect change for them and for their families and our families .
we cannot disappoint these people time and time again .
if truly good private members bills are introduced , regardless of who introduces them , we cannot continue to disappoint these people .
this is a practical common issue .
i hope my colleagues on the other side do not once again say that it is already in place , that there are laws which affect it and that we can arrest these people .
i can assure them that if they let this get to committee they will have police from every force in the country come to the committees to tell them that it does not work .
we must have change .
there is nothing more frustrating than a policeman coming on the scene , knowing that an offender is ready to snap , ready to break , ready to reoffend , and there is virtually nothing they can do until that person perpetrates yet another crime .
that says nothing at all about our willingness .
i ask my colleagues to look at this and trust that we will do something within committees and bring these peace officers forward and say we will try to help them and try to help ourselves in doing so .
i ask members to vote positively for Bill C - 211 .
Mr. Nick Discepola ( Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to address Bill C - 211 , a private member ' s bill , which seeks to amend the Criminal Code provisions relating to arrests without warrants .
i appreciate this opportunity to discuss an important aspect of criminal law which is not always well understood .
the bill , as introduced by the hon. member , would have two consequences .
first , it would amend the Criminal Code by making a breach of a condition of parole or statutory or temporary release an indictable offence .
this means the police would have the power to arrest , without a warrant , an offender concerning whom it would have reasonable grounds to believe that he made or is about to make a breach of a condition of his parole or statutory or temporary release .
this power is already provided in the Criminal Code for breach of probation .
the bill would also amend the Criminal Code by giving a parole board the power , following the arrest of an offender , to release him or to ask a judge to keep him in custody until it is able to issue a warrant of apprehension .
the present government has protection of the public at heart , protection from the potential risks of paroled offenders , and it has adopted several legislative measures or practices in this respect .
i would like to dispel certain inaccuracies and false ideas on which the hon. member ' s bill is based .
as far as the breach of conditions of parole , statutory or temporary release , as well as the prevention of such breaches , are concerned , I would like to point out that the Corrections and Conditional Release Act already gives correctional authorities all of the powers necessary to suspend an offender ' s parole .
an hon. member :
Mr. Nick Discepola :
this makes it possible for the police to arrest the offender and to place him in custody .
as for an offender who has received permission for an unescorted temporary release , an order for suspension may be issued if the reasons for which the permission was issued have changed or no longer exist , or if there is fresh information which would have altered the initial decision if available at the time it was made .
as for offenders on parole or statutory release , Correctional Services Canada and the National Parole Board may , at any time , issue a suspension warrant if they deem this necessary and reasonable for the protection of society .
such a mandate would permit the reincarceration of a delinquent until his case could be examined by the National Parole Board .
some people might wonder why the police do not have the same power of direct apprehension with respect to delinquents under federal responsibility who are on parole as they do for probationers .
i would like to clarify a few points on this matter , by explaining the significant differences between probation under provincial jurisdiction and parole under federal jurisdiction , whether we are talking of conditional release , statutory release or unescorted temporary absence .
probation is a court disposition which is not granted by the parole board .
it is a breach of probation and is a criminal offence because it constitutes a violation of a court order .
and when a breach of probation occurs , police have the same authority to arrest the person without a warrant , as they would any other person who is committing a criminal offence .
parole , statutory release and temporary absence , on the other hand , are not court orders .
they are forms of conditional release granted either by the National Parole Board or the correctional service of Canada .
all three types of releases are designed to facilitate the reintegration of offenders into the community as law - abiding citizens .
conditions of parole , statutory release and temporary absence constitute restrictions placed on the offender that assist the parole supervisor in managing the offender ' s risk while on conditional release .
because breaches of these conditions do not constitute criminal activity , board members and Correctional Service Canada staff are in the best position to determine when it is necessary to suspend the conditional release in order to manage the offender ' s risk and protect the community .
a person on parole , for example , may have advised his supervisor that , for good reason , he will be 15 minutes later than the time set for his return to the halfway house .
in such a case , the supervisor can , in full knowledge of the facts , decide not to suspend parole .
without such information , however , a police officer could arrest the delinquent for failing to meet the condition , even though he may be no immediate threat to society .
this would conflict with the parole plans approved by the National Parole Board and would weaken the board ' s authority .
although it could be argued that the member ' s bill is aimed at more serious offences , I would like to stress that , when police officers surprise an offender on conditional release in the act of committing a criminal offence , or when they have reasonable grounds to believe that a particular offender has committed or is on the point of committing a criminal offence , they already have all the power necessary to arrest him again without a warrant .
therefore the issue raised by the member ' s bill is not whether the powers of the police should be broadened in order to allow them to make arrests without warrants , but rather whether the powers they now have , and the correctional practices in effect , are sufficient to allow the police to take rapid action in situations where offenders on conditional release present a risk to the community .
our priority is the protection of the public , as I have already mentioned , and our government has taken many measures in this regard .
there have also been a number of initiatives in recent years to improve the transmission of information between the Correctional Service of Canada and the police , in order to ensure better management of offenders on conditional release under federal responsibility .
one key information sharing improvement is the ability to enhance information of the Canadian Police Information Computer Network , commonly known as CPIC .
through a link between CPIC and the Correctional Service Canada offender management system , police forces have direct access to information on conditionally released offenders including their conditions of release .
to enable police to respond promptly whenever they suspect a federal offender has breached a condition of parole or unescorted temporary absence , Correctional Service Canada has a national network of duty officers who are available 24 hours a day seven days a week .
this network is in place in each region of the Correctional Service Canada and all police departments have been notified of the duty officer ' s phone number .
upon being advised by a police officer of a breach or potential breach of parole , the duty officer can issue a suspension of warrant right on the spot , which gives the police the authority to arrest the offender and promptly bring him or her into custody .
again , to ensure the police can respond as fast as possible , the Corrections and Conditional Release Act also authorizes the facsimile transmission of warrants and gives police officers the authority to arrest the offender , without warrant , on the knowledge that one has been issued .
as the hon. members will note , the police already have the powers and the means they need to intervene quickly when they see that a federal delinquent has failed to meet the conditions of his release .
the member ' s bill assumes that the police are limited in the measures they can take to protect the public or that they are subject to unreasonable time frames , but the fact is that this has never really been proved .
i would point out that , in the absence of such proof , provisions that would give the police broader powers to arrest without warrant people on parole who have not committed a criminal offence will most likely not stand up to a challenge based on the charter of rights .
in conclusion , the government fully supports the objective of better protection for the community , and we cannot support this bill .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , when there is talk of parole , probation orders and so on , I believe that there is misunderstanding among the public and I believe that the Reform Party also has a poor understanding , or perhaps it suits them not to understand , because it is such a juicy topic .
they can drag out specific cases , and really talk altogether off topic .
the bill we have before us is a type of bill that does not reflect reality .
i am not saying there are no problems in the parole system or in application of the Criminal Code .
i do not believe , however , that Bill C - 211 is what is going to solve the problem .
what is important here ?
whether it is the Criminal Code and its provisions relating to probation orders , or the Corrections and Conditional Release Act , the criterion is protecting society .
at this time , do the courts , the law enforcement bodies in Quebec and Canada have the proper tools to do their job properly ?
my answer must be yes .
are the police officers , the correctional system , the courts , making the proper use of those tools , applying them in the way they were meant to be used ?
i sincerely believe that , with sections 494 , 495 , 496 and 497 of the Criminal Code , a broad range of cases are covered , as the Reform Party said just now .
i cannot sit by while they distort the facts .
i am a member of an opposition party , but an opposition party that is fair .
i try to do my job as honestly as possible , to be as realistic as possible , and I cannot , even though I am in the opposition , sit still and listen to nonsense spouted in the House .
i will give you four examples that I heard during the Reform Party ' s discourse .
the first , and this is a favourite topic of the Reformers , was what they had to say about pedophiles .
they say that a pedophile on conditional release who is near a playground will jump on the first victim he sees .
i know it does not suit you to hear the facts .
i know there is an immense gulf separating us , but I would ask you as politely as possible to at least listen to what Quebec has to say .
that having been said , with the provisions of the Criminal Code -
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
madam Speaker , would you please ask that bunch of Reform members to keep quiet .
an hon. member :
maybe you don ' t have institutions like we do .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
would hon. members please give everyone a chance to hear the speeches .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
madam Speaker , I was saying that there are four items of misinformation and I will name them right off .
then I will give them the right information .
as far as the pedophile is concerned , if there are conditions attached to his parole and he is found by a playground , it is false to say that the police can do nothing .
the police officer will use what I have here , the Criminal Code .
maybe I should give them a copy , as they seem not to have one .
it indicates very clearly - under section 497 - that a police officer , in fact , any person may arrest another person if he has reasonable grounds to believe that -
on top of that , the Corrections and Conditional Release Act contains a mechanism respecting individuals released under certain conditions or on statutory release , who fail to meet the conditions .
there are revocation mechanisms , the police can go and get them and so on .
the worst I heard concerns being under the influence .
when an individual is on parole or statutory release and drives under the influence of alcohol , the arresting police cannot take him to the police station even if he refuses to take the breathalyser test .
did the Reform Party recount anything more inexact or grosser this evening ?
is it usual to twist the facts in such a way for political purposes ?
i think it is for political purposes .
the final example is theft , and breaking and entering .
it is very true that the police may arrest an individual , as may anyone under section 494 , whether or not he is a police officer , who notices an individual in the act of committing an offence arrest that individual , and particulary if he is a police officer .
i think that there is a misunderstanding , or that they are deliberating distorting the meaning of these sections .
that having been said , I do not want to repeat what the parliamentary secretary to the Solicitor General said regarding the mechanism envisaged .
it can perhaps be improved .
as I said at the outset , there is undoubtedly room for improvement , but this is not the kind of improvement needed .
the more I listen to the Reform Party members , the more I can see where they are headed .
in the end , what they want is a justice system that is a bit like a robot , that is programmed to apply the right sections .
the judges would be replaced by a computer .
all the evidence would be fed into the computer and out would come the answer , an inhuman answer that does not take into account every relevant fact and serves but one specific goal : scoring political points .
i may be a sovereignist , a nationalist , a Quebec nationalist , still I can recognize that some things work in this system .
i think that , all in all , as flawed and imperfect as it may be , these things we should work at improving over time , our justice system is an excellent system .
i do not think that amendments like the one proposed in Bill C - 211 before us this evening will do much to improve on the current system .
on the contrary , I think it would confuse the courts , complicate things to achieve what the Criminal Code and the relevant legislation already provide for .
for all these reasons , the Bloc Quebecois will vote against private member ' s Bill C - 211 .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , I remind members that this is private members ' hour .
i regret to say that from time to time we seem to get into the sort of debate which assumes that a bill put forward by a private member of the Reform Party is somehow a Reform Party bill and it is the Reform Party that is being supported or criticized .
i would hope that private members ' hour would not become politicized in that negative sense .
it may well be that many members of the Reform Party support the bill that has been put forward by the hon. member and it may well be that members from other parties will want to oppose that bill .
but I caution against falling by default into a way of debating this bill that replicates the way we debate government legislation .
having said that , I am here not to speak on behalf of the NDP but to share some of my own thoughts about this .
i begin by saying that actually I am quite open minded about this .
i do not claim to understand the law in this regard .
i have heard conflicting claims .
there are people who say that the law as it stands provides adequate tools for meeting the problem that the hon. member has identified and he is bringing forward a bill in order to address it .
i have heard the hon. member say otherwise .
i have heard him accused of not paying attention to reality in the things that he has had to say .
i do not know .
i do not understand enough about how parole is administered and dealt with in order to say with authority whether I think the hon. member is right or is wrong , or whether he is operating simply out of a political agenda , but I do not think so .
i sense from the hon. member and from others that there is a lot of concern , not just on the part of the hon. member but on the part of many Canadians .
they are mystified on occasion by how it is that people who are on parole get to be in some of the places that they are and get to do some of the things that they do while they are on parole .
if the police , the courts and the system as it currently stands are able to deal with this or have the powers to deal with this , it still remains an open question as to why it appears to so many Canadians that they do not , and that occasions arise in what seems to be a persistent way .
i say seems because I do not have the research at hand , but it certainly seems this way to many Canadians and they feel the justice system is somehow letting them down in terms of public safety .
my attitude toward this bill at this point is that I have not made up my mind yet .
that is why we give votable items three hours of debate .
it is so that we do not all come in here in the first hour of debate with our minds made up .
some people ' s minds are made up .
that is fair enough .
for my part , I intend to review what has been said today , to look at what is said in the second hour and indeed in the third hour .
having said that , I just want to indicate that if what the hon. member who has put this bill forward is saying is true , I am concerned .
i would be concerned when the police identify someone who is on parole in a situation which is in breach of those parole conditions .
i share the hon. member ' s concern about that situation but I am open to be persuaded as to whether or not the law as it currently stands has the ability to deal with this .
but even that is not good enough in the sense that I would like to know that if it does have the ability to deal with it , why is there such a widespread perception that it does not use those tools .
it is not enough to say that there is the capacity to do a certain thing .
we need to know that the system is designed in such a way as to create the will to use that capacity and to use the tools that are available to the police and to the courts now .
it may be that there is some flaw in the design of the system as it now exists which discourages police from using the powers that are now at their disposal .
the member ' s bill might be an answer to that or it might not be .
there might be some other way of addressing this , which would argue it seems to me for why it might be a good idea to send such a bill to committee .
the committee could report either that it is a good idea or that the problem the member has identified and which he is trying to address with this bill is a real problem but the bill itself for a variety of reasons does not do the trick or does not stand the test of scrutiny .
there may be other alternatives .
all these things are open to us , and I look forward to listening to the debate in this hour and as it progresses .
i hope other hon. members will do the same because we are all going to be called to vote on this at the end of the day , not at the end of this day but metaphorically speaking whenever the three hours is up .
we hope hon. members who speak next will have some light to shed on this .
i am certainly hoping that I will be able to learn something on both sides of this debate from members who will speak after me .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
madam Speaker , I am very pleased to speak on this bill which has been introduced by the Reform member for Langley - Abbotsford and my counterpart as House leader in the Reform Party .
as mentioned by previous speakers , Bill C - 211 would amend the Criminal Code as it applies to the arresting and detaining of individuals who breach their conditions of parole or statutory or temporary release .
in principle I want to state at the outset that I agree with the bill .
in my view it provides our law enforcement officers an additional tool in their fight against crime .
i fully endorse this .
the changes that are talked of here in section 495 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Criminal Code which would allow peace officers to arrest individuals who breach their conditions of parole or release , in particular , deserve support by this Chamber and its hon. members .
i say so with some experience myself .
i listened very carefully to the comments of the hon. member from the Reform Party who had from the sounds of it consulted extensively with a peace officer in his riding .
i have spoken personally to a number of police officers as well .
i have spoken to Constable Kevin Scott , Constable Dwayne Rutledge and other police officers from my riding of Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough .
i have sensed the frustration that many of our police officers sense when dealing with criminals who have gone through the process .
criminals have been convicted after due process .
they have gone through appeal processes and are serving time as their debt to society and upon being convicted and placed in an institution , having appeared potentially before a parole board , have been granted early release often with good reason .
the principle to recall here is the fact that those individuals are paying a debt to society .
if released early , essentially they are being given a break , a second chance , and while in society and taking advantage of the break that has been afforded them , they run afoul of conditions which for good reason have been placed upon them .
i listened again with great interest to the comments with respect in particular to pedophiles or individuals who have been told to abstain from alcohol .
i would suggest that it is extremely important for police officers , who observe individuals who have these conditions placed upon them , to have the ability to act and to act quickly and decisively .
i listened as well again with great interest to the comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General .
i agree that in its present form the Criminal Code does have provisions for police officers to act in a decisive way to get authorization to place an individual under arrest .
the difficulty is in the timing .
officers do not always have the time to get the necessary authorization .
they do not always have the time to get to a justice of the peace who will give them the go ahead , or to contact the parole officer involved , particularly in rural parts of the country .
in rural Canada detachments often have one or two officers .
often the justice of the peace is responsible for a vast territory .
human nature being what it is , that justice of the peace may be over at his neighbour ' s playing cards .
he may simply be out in the barn .
unfortunately , justices of the peace are not always on call 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
this is a very timely debate .
another bill is presently before the House which is the so - called Feeney bill , Bill C - 16 .
it touches on much of the same subject matter that is being discussed today .
i want to discuss another component of the amendment to section 497 of the Criminal Code .
it would give the National Parole Board the opportunity to apply to keep a person , who is in breach of his conditions , in custody until the board can issue a warrant of apprehension .
this is not an arbitrary detention .
we are discussing the rights of an individual who has had the benefit of due process and has been convicted of a criminal offence .
there is an important distinction to be made .
i do not favour voting rights for criminals , nor do I favour , in this particular instance , any sort of special treatment or special allotment or second chance .
the individual is paying his debt to society .
he has been afforded early release and has now run afoul of those conditions .
i generally support the change , with some reservations .
any form of arbitrary detention has to be carefully scrutinized .
the key word is arbitrary .
the provisions put forward by the hon. member of the Reform Party , I would suggest , are not arbitrary in any way , shape or form .
the direction provided in this bill for detention may be vague and may eventually undergo the scrutiny of the charter of rights and freedoms .
i would suggest that this is true of any amendment made to the Criminal Code .
defence lawyers , I am sure , will be ready to pounce on any detention of their clients which would later be proved unjustified .
this is merely a caution that I raise .
perhaps we could clarify the language in the bill .
i am sure the hon. member of the Reform Party would embrace that , as long as it did not change significantly the principle which he is trying to bring forward .
the intent of this bill is positive .
i am pleased to say that we in the Conservative Party support it .
i would also embrace another theme touched on by the hon. member , and it is that we should strive toward making the law not only more efficient but simpler .
it should be more understandable , not only for police officers who have legal training , but for the public at large .
i believe that the public at large is becoming alienated and , to some degree , very disgusted with our criminal justice system .
overall there are changes that can be made to the Criminal Code .
i believe this is the forum and the place for elected officials to partake of that process .
another reason I support this bill is that it would open a window of opportunity for the National Parole Board to collect additional information on offenders when possible .
it would be a responsible thing for them to do .
the offenders who break their terms of parole or conditions of release are once again breaking society ' s trust in their ability to respect the law .
the National Parole Board consents to returning offenders to the mainstream of society on certain conditions .
if those conditions are breached , then the board , in turn , must act responsibly and re - evaluate the risk to society posed by the offender .
a convicted person forfeits the rights which are afforded to all Canadians .
the bill gives the National Parole Board additional authority to exercise that responsibility , and there is a larger question at play here .
the question concerns the effectiveness of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act , especially as it relates to the National Parole Board .
the mandate of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act is established by an internal board of investigation on incidents .
these incidents should be brought forward and examined at length to see if the National Parole Board is living up to the standard .
i want to mention one further positive element of this bill that requires parliamentary study , the ability to exercise the arrests that these police officers are charged with .
i think we have to look most specifically at whether this bill will improve the present law .
will it allow police officers to more effectively carry out the very onerous task that is imposed on them to protect society ?
if this will further the cause of justice , then it is something we have to work together in a non - partisan way to see carried through to fruition .
Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I am very pleased to address this motion .
the hon. member ' s bill as drafted would do two things .
first , it would amend the Criminal Code to make a breach of a condition of parole , statutory release or temporary absence a criminal offence .
as a consequence police would have the authority to arrest without warrant an offender who on reasonable grounds is believed to have breached or is about to breach a condition of parole , statutory release or unescorted temporary absence .
this authority already exists in the Criminal Code for breach of probation , as the parliamentary secretary did indicate earlier .
second , the bill would amend the Criminal Code to authorize a parole board , following an offender ' s arrest , to either release the offender or apply to a justice to detain the offender in custody until the board could issue a warrant .
public protection from conditionally released offenders is a matter of serious concern to this government and an area where we have made several legislative and practical improvements .
i would like to clarify some inaccuracies and misconceptions on which the hon. member ' s bill is founded .
with respect to violations and preventions of breaches of parole , statutory release and unescorted temporary absence conditions , the Corrections and Conditional Release Act already provides ample authority for an offender ' s conditional release to be suspended by correctional officials .
this enables police to arrest the offender and bring him or her into custody .
with regard to an offender on an unescorted temporary absence , a suspension warrant can be issued where the grounds for granting the absence have changed or no longer exist or when new information becomes available that would have altered the original decision .
with respect to an offender on parole or statutory release , a suspension warrant can be issued at any time by the correctional service of Canada and the National Parole Board when it is believed to be necessary and reasonable in order to protect society .
execution of this warrant provides sufficient authority to return the offender to custody until the case can be reviewed by the National Parole Board .
some may reasonably question why police do not have the same direct authority to arrest conditionally released federal offenders as they do for probationers .
i would like to briefly address this question by explaining the key differences between provincial probation and federal conditional release , be it parole , statutory release or an unescorted temporary absence .
probation is a court disposition which is not granted by a parole board .
a breach of probation is a criminal offence because it constitutes a violation of a court order , as was pointed out earlier .
when a breach of probation occurs police have the same authority to arrest a person without a warrant as they would any other person who has committed a criminal offence .
parole , statutory release and temporary absences , on the other hand , are not court orders , as was pointed out earlier .
they are forms of conditional release granted either by the National Parole Board or the correctional service of Canada .
all three types of releases are designed to facilitate the reintegration of offenders into the community as law - abiding citizens .
we know very well the position of the Reform Party on that .
conditions of parole , statutory release and temporary absence constitute restrictions placed on the offender that assist the parole supervisor in managing the offender ' s risk while on conditional release .
because breaches -

the time provided for the consideration of Private Members ' Business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper .
adjournment PROCEEDINGS

trade
Mr. Roger Gallaway ( Sarnia - Lambton , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , on October 29 , I raised the question where do we sit as government with respect to a bill passed in the last Parliament known as the MMT bill , Bill C - 29 or Bill C - 94 .
members and people watching should know that this legislation came forward in the last Parliament for various stated reasons .
the first time it came in , the government said it wanted to have a uniform blend of gasoline .
but this was not case .
it was not a health matter because Health Canada at that time was issuing statements saying there were no known health risks with MMT .
it could not find any risks and would give a published statement to that effect .
the government on one hand was saying that public safety was the reason , and that is a very laudable and noble objective .
but if I were to follow the rationale of the environment department , then I am sure there are a lot of other products we could outlaw , such as bacon or donuts , because they too are allegedly bad for your health .
in the end the bill passed the Commons .
it forbids the importation of MMT .
it is interesting to note that the environment department proposed a bill that is a trade bill .
it is a bill that bans the importation of a product .
the manufacturer of that product , Ethyl Corporation , now has the Government of Canada before a NAFTA trade tribunal .
what is the outcome likely to be ?
there are two possible outcomes .
how is it going to affect Canadians ?
the answers are clear .
if we loose this challenge under the NAFTA , we are going to pay $ 201 million U.S. or we are going to have to revoke the law .
second , if we win the NAFTA trade challenge , Canadians are going to pay more for gasoline at the pumps .
i ask members here , in particular the parliamentary secretary , and those watching , who is going to pay ?
Canadians can pay at the gas pumps or Canadians can pay through their taxes .
i would ask that the next time parliamentarians want to talk about the price of gasoline they tell Canadians that , with respect to the increase in the price of gasoline , they contributed to the problem .
i think this is the least that those who supported this bill can do for Canadians .
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
on April 14 , Ethyl Corporation , the sole North American producer of MMT , filed a claim for damages under the investor stated dispute settlement provisions in chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement .
the arbitration will be conducted pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Rules which provide that one arbiter be appointed by each of the disputing parties and a third appointee appointed by agreement of the disputing parties .
three highly respected international arbiters have been appointed to the tribunal .
Ethyl Corporation has named Charles Brower , a lawyer practising in international arbitration in Washington , and the Government of Canada has appointed the Hon. Marc Lalonde , a lawyer in Montreal also practising international arbitration .
Mr. Karl - Heinz Bockstiegel of Germany has agreed to serve as the presiding arbiter .
on October 2 the parties met with the tribunal to discuss procedural issues .
at the meeting the schedule for the coming months was set .
the first oral hearing will be February 24 and February 25 , 1998 .
the rules and procedures governing NAFTA dispute settlement were developed with a view to ensuring a just and cost effective resolution of disputes .
as this matter is currently before the tribunal it would be inappropriate for me to express any opinion on the merits of the case .
that is for the competent tribunal to decide .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the motion to adjourn the House is deemed to have been adopted .
accordingly , this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
( the House adjourned at 6.56 p.m. )

house OF COMMONS

government ORDERS
criminal CODE
the House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C - 16 , an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Interpretation Act ( powers to arrest and enter dwelling ) , as reported ( with amendment ) from the committee .
speaker ' S RULING
the Speaker :
there are six motions in amendment standing on the Notice Paper for the report stage of Bill C - 16 .
motion No. 1 will be debated and voted upon .
motions Nos. 2 , 4 and 6 will be grouped for debate .
a vote on Motion No. 2 applies to Motions Nos. 4 and 6 .
motions Nos. 3 and 5 will be grouped for debate .
a vote on Motion No. 3 applies to Motion No. 5 .
i shall now propose Motion No. 1 to the House .
motions IN AMENDMENT
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) moved :
motion No. 1
that Bill C - 16 , in Clause 2 , be amended by replacing lines 36 to 45 on page 5 and lines 1 and 2 on page 6 with the following :
we are facing a problem within the Department of Justice when important amendments are being made to the Criminal Code that for all intents and purposes are being ramrodded through at the committee level and through the House .
as a result of the supreme court decision in the Queen v Feeney , the Department of Justice was faced with a situation in which it had to fill a gap that had been left by the supreme court when it struck down sections of the Criminal Code that pertained to the powers of arrest .
what has happened here is akin to the trampling on the right of Parliament to actively and in a substantive way participate in the debate and the process to make recommendations as they pertain to the Criminal Code of Canada .
time was certainly of the essence .
the supreme court , by virtue of a stay that was entered back in July of 1997 , gave Parliament the time to react to fill the gap left by the decision handed down in the Queen v Feeney .
the problem that I have with this is that five and a half months have past .
the justice department was given ample opportunity to react , to make the appropriate amendments to address this situation .
by the time it reached committee stage , members of Parliament , the elected officials of this House , were given less than five days to consider it .
to be precise , they were given approximately eight hours to discuss , in the presence of witnesses and among each other , these very important amendments which affect the powers of arrest for all police throughout the land .
we heard from a victims ' advocate group , the Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime .
of all the witnesses , he made a statement which I found quite startling .
that is not to say that his opinion could not be wrong .
however , when an experienced trial and appeal court lawyer makes this pronouncement before a committee , hours before the amendments are tabled and given third reading , that should give the department and all members of the committee reason to pause and to ponder whether we want to have this legislation pushed through in a flawed form , leaving it open to the possibility that within months , weeks or days we could be faced with another court challenge which may strike down , in the worst case scenario , these amendments .
the first amendment which I have put before the House pertains to the authorization of telewarrants in Canada .
this amendment came about after some consultation with the Quebec bar association , which did not appear before the committee but which submitted a brief .
the amendment speaks to the evolution of new technology in communications which should be made available to all peace officers in the country .
the reality of Canada , of this vast land , is that we are not all centred in large metropolitan areas like Calgary , Toronto or Halifax .
a great part of this country is spread out in rural areas .
police officers are often working out of one or two person detachments .
telewarrants , this new form of technology that we have with fax machines , with telephones and with cell phones , increase the possibility that a police officer can do something when faced with exigent circumstances .
exigent circumstances is a newly coined phrase that came out of the decision of the Queen v Feeney .
exigent circumstances often exist in the daily lives of police officers that are faced with very serious situations .
telewarrants permit police officers to contact justices of the peace , but that is all for naught if the resources are not allocated to make justices of the peace available .
it is easy to pick up a phone or to dial a fax number , but if no one is on the other end of the line to receive the information and authorize the warrant , a real problem exists .
i would suggest that this amendment goes further than the present amendment as proposed by the government in enabling peace officers in broader circumstances to avail themselves of the ability to have a warrant granted .
i want to add to that the necessity of the resources .
the resources have to go cheek and jowl with the ability to get these warrants .
we need to ensure that there are going to be more justices of the peace available , particularly in rural parts of the country .
i would emphasize the remarks I made at the outset .
it is with some regret I find myself in this situation where we have to debate this further on the floor of the House of Commons .
the committee level , had it been conducted in a more professional and timely way , would have avoided this necessity .
this amendment is one that all members of the House should consider and support .
it goes to increasing the security for all Canadians and aids the police in their very important role in enforcing the criminal law within the country .
as members of this House , particularly members of the justice committee , we have to be very strident in our attempts to oversee what is happening with the amendments to the Criminal Code .
the Minister of Justice , the chief executive officer for administering law in this country , can and should have at least contemplated the necessity of rising from her seat , walking down Wellington Street , knocking on the door of the Supreme Court of Canada and ask for an extension .
it would have avoided the necessity of pushing this through at the eleventh hour .
it would have allowed us to have proper debate at the committee level and if necessary on the floor of the House of Commons .
i speak in favour of this amendment .
i would be very interested to hear the remarks of the hon. members present today .
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I would like to start by repeating what has already been said in the House , which is that the government was obliged by the supreme court to ensure that both sides of the House could meet a court set deadline .
this was not a deadline set by the government but imposed on us by the Supreme Court of Canada .
i would also add that in my view sufficient time has been allowed , both in the House and in committee , for opposition motions to be brought .
unfortunately , only one was received in committee .
there was no discussion by the opposition on these motions .
this is really stretching a point , because there was ample time available Wednesday evening for discussion and the opposition brought no amendments .
i would like to point out that we feel that , yes , the deadline is a little short .
the deadline was imposed on us by the supreme court .
it was not a deadline that we imposed on this House .
second , there was ample time .
the committee members on the government side were more than willing to spend more time discussing any motion brought forward by any member of the opposition .
none of these motions was brought forward .
there was discussion but none of the motions was brought forward to be discussed at the committee level .
the opposition members decided to bring them forward in the House .
fearmongering from the opposition by saying this will be unconstitutional is presumptive on the part of the opposition .
we do not know whether this will be declared unconstitutional .
we had no constitutional experts that came before the committee to to testify except a lawyer .
i think that is an assumption that should not have been made .
the government is not able to support motion No. 1 .
this affects the very notion of practicability .
it is nothing new and it is seen as necessary to defend the constitutionality of the entire telewarrant scheme in the Criminal Code .
motions 2 , 4 and 6 all relate to the use of the singular to refer to dwelling house in the bill .
some have argued that in order to allow for warrants to apply to more than one dwelling house we need to refer to dwelling house in the plural .
that is why we have the Interpretation Act .
the Interpretation Act already provides that the singular includes the plural .
all federal legislation , and this legislation in particular , Bill C - 16 , has been drafted with that rule in mind .
it would make the interpretation of other statutes more difficult and uncertain in the future .
we are not able to support this motion as it is inconsistent with other provisions of the Criminal Code .
on Motion No 3 , we are not able to support this motion either .
the reason is that the motion addresses form 7 because it is a warrant for arrest .
however , the government would be amenable for supporting Motion No. 5 , and I will speak to that motion .
this amendment relates to form 7.1 and section 529.1 of the Criminal Code .
the amendment would make it clear in the form what is already permitted by section 529.1 .
that section makes it possible to obtain a warrant for entry in order to arrest someone who is identifiable as opposed to identified .
i believe that if this form were amended as proposed by the hon. member we would be improving on the language in the bill by making it perfectly clear on the form itself that this is possible .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to speak to this extremely important bill .
like the members who spoke before me , I think I will say a few words on the procedure imposed on the Committee on Justice and Human Rights .
i know that it is following a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Feeney case that the government was required so to speak to amend the provisions if it wanted to correct the situation .
the ruling was made on May 22 , 1997 , in the middle of the electoral campaign .
however , as I openly said in committee - and there is no reason to hide this - officials wisely held consultations across Canada and Quebec .
my concern in all this is that there were no consultations before the political side of this issue was addressed , that it was only on Friday of last week that Bill C - 16 , which is in fact very important , was tabled in this House , which has been sitting for eight weeks .
it may not be the fault of the Liberal members , but it is surely the fault of the federal government ' s cumbersome bureaucracy and procedures if we have to accelerate the review process as we are doing .
however , after consulting with people who have an interest in seeing this bill improve the Criminal Code , I believe that this bill is generally acceptable .
we do not support it without reservations , but considering the time we have to review it , I believe that as a first step , it is something we can live with .
i will deal with the amendments in each group .
i will speak very briefly on the first group , which includes Motion No. 1 .
i think that the wording of Section 529.5 in Bill C - 16 reflects in fact what is found in other provisions , other laws .
i don ' t think we should amend this section as proposed by the member of the Conservative Party .
i think that the wording in the section on telewarrants meets requirements that have already been established in this area .
i want to read it to you because I think it clearly indicates that such warrants may only be issued in exceptional circumstances .
the rule is that the peace officer must appear personally before the judge to make an application for a warrant , but it can happen in exceptional circumstances that it would be impracticable , to use the words in the section , or impossible for the police officer to appear before a judge .
it can also be an emergency situation - and there is a section that deals with these - , and the police officer cannot appear before a judge .
the section , which is very clear , says the following :
i think that the wording reflects the purpose of this section , and to keep our laws in general as simple as possible , I believe that we should not amend this section because it is similar to all other sections dealing with telewarrants .
that is why we will oppose Motion No. 1 as presented .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , I thought I might have to get up on a chair to get noticed .
i regret very much the situation that the House finds itself in at the moment from a number of points of view .
i thought there had been an understanding to dispose of this matter by today .
now it appears that technically speaking that was not the case .
there was only an agreement , technically speaking , to begin the debate today and this will now carry over , I presume .
it also means that some of us , having taken the agreement a little more seriously than others , find ourselves in a bit of difficulty .
fundamentally I think the government has to take some responsibility for this because I see a pattern emerging here .
i think this is the third time in this Parliament when we have been presented with something that has to be dealt with by a certain date .
there is always truth in that claim but the truth comes from the fact that the government has left it until the 11 th hour , so to speak .
in respect of this particular bill , we thought that the government ' s argument had more merit but was not entirely meritorious in the sense that this is something the government has known about since July .
i do not know why these amendments could not have been moved in committee but I assume there must have been some good reason why the hon. member moved them now at report stage .
perhaps he tried and the government prevented it in some way .
however , it is surely the case that the amendments we have now before us mean that this will be carried over until after the break unless there is some procedural way of dealing with this that I do not know about at the moment .
obviously the NDP has supported the government along with all the other parties in dealing with this situation that the supreme court has put back in the hands of Parliament by virtue of its decision in the Feeney case .
we will be considering very carefully the amendments put forward by the hon. member and will render a judgment in due course .
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos :
madam Speaker , I just wanted to know whether the hon. member who presented the motion has agreed that we can separate Motion No. 3 from Motion No. 5 .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the parliamentary secretary is getting a little ahead of us .
at the moment , we are dealing with Group No. 1 , Motion No. 1 .
we will go on to the next ones after that .
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
some hon. members :
No.
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
all those in favour will please say yea .
some hon. members :
yea .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
all those opposed will please say nay .
some hon. members :
nay .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
in my opinion the nays have it .
some hon. members :
on division .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i declare the motion lost on division .
( motion No. 1 negatived )
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
motions Nos. 2 , 4 and 6 will be grouped for debate .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) moved :
motion No. 2
that Bill C - 16 , in Clause 2 , be amended by adding after line 2 on page 6 the following :
motion No. 4
that Bill C - 16 , in Clause 3 , be amended by
( a ) replacing line 27 on page 7 with the following :
( b ) replacing line 29 on page 7 with the following :
" dwelling - house or houses unless you have , immediately before entering the dwelling - house or houses , reason - "
( d ) replacing line 36 on page 7 with the following :
( b ) replacing line 23 on page 8 with the following :
" enter the dwelling house or houses for the purpose of ar - "
in its present form this amendment speaks of the naming of a single dwelling house .
i know the government ' s response may include the Interpretation Act wherein the singular includes the plural .
one of the purposes of parliament should be to create new , wordy and mellifluous sounding legislation and to simplify for the police , and as I said in the House yesterday for the purpose of the general public , understanding of the legislation that directly applies to them .
for example , if a criminal was believed to be harboured in the home of a friend , at a clubhouse or at a residence that he was known to frequent , the police could quite simply place on the warrant a number of dwelling houses or house in which they were searching for him .
it gives the police more flexibility in their ability to investigate .
it is a very straightforward amendment .
i would be surprised if the government were not quick to embrace it .
i also want to address a question posed by my hon. friend from the NDP with respect to why this is the forum in which to make these amendments .
as I indicated earlier , what occurred in committee was a simple ramrod railroad approach to clause by clause discussion of these amendments .
there was no opportunity to discuss or to put these amendments forward .
it was done in the blink of an eye without any ability to put the amendments forward in any substantive way , to the point where we were so rushed in the compromise of this committee that we did not even have the opportunity to speak of the ground rules that would govern the committee itself .
this was done after the fact .
we brought this piece of legislation to the committee level without having set the rules to govern the committee that was going to be making decisions on the amendments .
this causes me great concern .
i put this amendment forward in all god faith and in all seriousness .
i encourage hon. members of the House to look at it .
i have tried to explain it in a very straightforward way .
it is one which would assist police in their very necessary and very public duty to carry out and exercise arrests throughout the country .
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I will just repeat that we on this side of the House do not support Motions Nos. 2 , 4 and 6 .
i am not looking for sympathy from the opposition members .
as other members have said , there was agreement of all parties to expedite passage of the legislation through the House .
again I repeat that we have an obligation to the Supreme Court of Canada to meet its deadline .
i would appreciate co - operation , but I am certainly not looking for sympathy from opposition members .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I will not speak more than a few moments .
i want to reply briefly to what the member from the government side said and to support my colleague .
the government made the point that it has an obligation to pass the legislation as quickly as possible .
the Liberals had six months .
they knew it was coming but they have left it to the 11 th hour .
we have seen time and time again in the last four years that they ram things through at the last moment .
i want to register my objection to the process here .
we did not have the opportunity at committee to introduce a lot of these amendments .
i support the amendments that are being made .
the government is dismissing them at hand because they come from the opposition .
i do not think that is acceptable .
i would like to register my objection to these kinds of things happening in the House .
for democracy to function properly we need time to look at legislation , to examine it properly and to make sure it is the best legislation we can have .
we have seen too much legislation being passed with time allocation , being rammed through at the last minute .
then we come back and realize that we did not get it right , that we made some grave errors .
it is happening again and again .
we could have done this months ago .
this could have been introduced at the beginning of this Parliament but it was not .
that ought to be on the record to show that we do not like what is happening in the House .
Mr. Peter MacKay :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to respond to the comment made by the parliamentary secretary that the government had to get this legislation through .
there was reference to the court essentially setting a deadline without any compromise .
that is not the case .
there is precedent that there can be extensions .
a request could have been made to the supreme court quite simply .
that is my point of clarification .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I will take 30 seconds since I want this bill to pass today .
i would say first off that I oppose these motions and I will tell you why briefly .
as we know , an arrest warrant , a warrant to enter a dwelling house or other similar warrants already contravenes the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
it is too broad and too vague .
i think we are leaving ourselves open once again to criticism , and certainly to having these amendments to Bill C - 16 , or more specifically , clause 529.6 ,
rejected by the courts as in the Feeney case .
this is our only reason for opposing these three motions .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the question is on Motion No. 2 . Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
some hon. members :
No.
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea .
some hon. members :
yea .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
all those opposed will please say nay .
some hon. members :
nay .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
in my opinion the yeas have it .
and more than five members having risen :
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the division on Motion No. 2 stands deferred .
the recorded division will also apply to Motions Nos. 4 and 6 .
motions Nos. 3 and 5 will be grouped for debate .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
i rise on a point of order , Madam Speaker . I have two points .
second , while I sit at the other end of the chamber , it was obvious to me that the nays were louder than the yeas .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , when you make a ruling on something like this , another member cannot argue with you , dispute the ruling and reverse it .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
on the point of order raised by the hon. member for Berthier - Montcalm , I would like to point out that Motions Nos. 4 and 6 were included in Motion No. 2 .
i will now deal with the point of order raised by the other hon. member .
the decision has been taken .
on the other hand , if the House wishes to give me other instructions , I am prepared to listen .
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I would also concur with the hon. member from the Bloc .
i believe in terms of the yeas and the nays , that the nays had it also .
also , we would like to voice our objection to the ruling of the Chair .
i agree that it was not mentioned that Motions Nos. 2 , 4 and 6 were going to be grouped together and that we were going to vote on a package .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I would remind you that if you reverse your ruling in this case you are setting a precedent .
Ms. Marlene Catterall ( Ottawa West - Nepean , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , may I suggest that there is substantial agreement in the House on the importance of this legislation .
we are 10 minutes away from question period .
i wonder if the House would be agreeable to proceed with the next group of motions .
discussions could be held during question period and in the minutes leading up to question period to resolve this situation to the satisfaction of the House .
if we could move on to debate the next group of motions then we might be able to conclude the business which the House wishes to conclude today .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , Fridays are supposed to be slow days , but not always .
let us get on with it .
i think that Standing Order 10 is very clear as to how things should be conducted in the House .
Mr. Andr 茅 Harvey :
madam Speaker , with all due respect for the office you hold , I would like to point out that it is absolutely impossible to reverse a ruling made by the Chair .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , it would be most unusual if the House were to somehow try to overturn your ruling by doing what I do not understand it to be permitted to do , which is to appeal your judgment of what you heard in terms of yeas and nays .
i happen to share the view that you heard differently than I heard .
but it is up to the Chair to judge what the Chair hears and to make that judgment .
it puts the House in a rather difficult position , because certainly had you ruled the other way with respect to yeas and nays , opposition members would have had a chance to decide whether they wanted a recorded vote on this .
perhaps they would have risen anyway .
the irony is that the government was forced by virtue of your ruling to cause a recorded vote on the very thing that it did not want a recorded vote on .
i am sure the government regards that as unfortunate but whether it is reversible or not is another matter .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
we shall proceed to Motion No. 3 .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) moved :
motion No. 3
that Bill C - 16 , in Clause 3 , be amended by adding after line 10 on page 6 the following :
" or a person with the following description ( - ) , "
motion No. 5
that Bill C - 16 , in Clause 3 , be amended by replacing line 7 on page 8 with the following :
" of A . B . , or a person with the following description ( - ) , "
in circumstances where the exact name of the individual sought is unknown to police officers , rather than put in the actual written name of that individual , they could put in a physical description , thus increasing their ability in investigations where the name of the person sought by police for whatever reason could be pencilled in .
it is not an arbitrary or frivolous change to the form that would be included in the warrant .
i would strenuously suggest that this is something to which the government should give due consideration in its adaptation of both amendments with respect to clause 3 in the bill , as they pertain to Form 7 and Form 7.1 .
for those reasons I would again solicit the support of the House , including the government , with respect to this amendment .
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , without belabouring the point , we had asked the hon. member if he would be willing to separate motion No. 3 from motion No. 5 .
i take it to mean that he is not going to agree to separate motion No. 3 from motion No. 5 ?
Mr. Peter MacKay :
madam Speaker , I have no difficulty whatsoever with having these two amendments split and discussed separately , that is amendment 3 and amendment 5 .
i am certainly prepared to agree to that suggestion by the parliamentary secretary .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
does the House agree to have a debate and to hold two separate votes on Motions Nos. 3 and 5 ?
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , again members are challenging your ruling .
i think there are some things going on this morning that are unacceptable .
look at what has happened during discussion of the previous motion .
you made a ruling and the government , rather than letting the legislation proceed , challenged the vote .
it is so intent on blocking these amendments that it would rather delay the bill than let us proceed and approve the amendment .
the government forced a vote and challenged the ruling .
now it is challenging it again .
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
understand clearly there has been a tremendous amount of co - operation by all parties on an issue of significance which has been presented to the legislature in not what people would recognize as ideal conditions , both from the opposition and the government side .
we have arrived at this juncture , at report stage and third reading , and clearly and emphatically the government has no intention , never had or ever would question or appeal the ruling of a chair .
for what it is worth to the new members , I had the privilege and honour of sitting in that chair for three years .
i hold it the highest esteem , as all my colleagues do on both sides of the House .
the question at this time is whether , in the ruling that was made the Speaker and respecting that ruling , there would be unanimous consent .
we know from time to time only by way of unanimous consent can this Chamber go beyond some of those rulings .
in this instance the government is in a situation , quite frankly , where conceivably it would like to support one of the amendments and perhaps not the other .
if they were separated we would have the opportunity to address that specific individual amendment .
we are asking the consent of the House , if it would allow the debate to continue with those two items separated and dealt with individually .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
is the House in agreement with the suggestions from the whip of the government ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
it being 11 a.m. , we will now proceed to statements by members .
statements BY MEMBERS
coal INDUSTRY
hon. Charles Caccia ( Davenport , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , having lost one battle when the U . K . switched to natural gas , the coal industry now brings its fear mongering to Canada .
they invoke the idea of global cooling to throw the climate change debate off course .
but informed scientists conclude that global warming is a problem and that we must act .
burning coal is highly damaging to the environment and human health .
the remedies proposed by the coal association are inspired by profound ignorance of the links between coal burning and damage to water , agriculture , forests , fish spawning grounds and human health .
to reach the goal of stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions by 2005 , and 20 % reductions by 2010 , the answer lies not with coal but with improved energy efficiency and conservation , with technology that will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels , and with greater use of natural gas .
* * *
EKREM KOLAY
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , as I speak , Ekrem Kolay is wasting away outside Canada Place in Edmonton .
he has been on a hunger strike for 15 days to bring this government ' s attention to the imprisonment of Leyla Zana , a mother of two and a celebrated former member of the Turkish parliament .
Leyla Zana was imprisoned for standing up for the wishes of her constituents , for speaking out against human rights violations in Turkey when very few others had the courage to do so .
amnesty International , British parliamentarians , members of the U.S. Congress , the Canadian Labour Congress , the Alberta Federation of Labour , members of the provincial and federal NDP , and local Edmonton churches and businesses have all joined Ekrem Kolay in his campaign to free Leyla Zana .
Ekrem Kolay is waiting for just one more person to join his struggle before he promises to eat his first meal .
the Minister of Foreign Affairs is now the only man who can decide whether my constituent eats or continues to slowly starve .

HAVELOCK , ONTARIO
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I speak today about one village in Canada , the village of Havelock , Ontario , home to 1,300 people .
this is a community which has faced up to difficult times with great success .
this summer the village held its first " Rock ` n Rail " festival to celebrate its heritage as a mining and railroad town .
this event attracted thousands of visitors , including 4,000 who took the special train rides through eastern Peterborough county .
a few weeks later this same tiny community again hosted thousands , this time for the annual Havelock country music festival jamboree and trade show , which I described previously in this House .
the jamboree is now one of the major celebrations of country music in eastern Canada .
the citizens of Havelock are an example to us all .
our thanks to them , especially those who worked so hard on these two events .

pay EQUITY
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like once again to draw the attention of the President of the Treasury Board to the dissatisfaction of federal public servants regarding the settlement of the pay equity issue .
revenue Canada has a major taxation centre in Jonqui 猫 re .
i am asking the President of the Treasury Board to read each of the some 620 letters which I received and which I will send to him at the earliest opportunity .
all these employees question the $ 10 billion deficit reduction that the finance minister is bragging about .
i join them in asking that the issue of pay equity be settled .
it is high time these employees get their due .

canada CAREER WEEK
Mrs. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to add my voice of praise and support for Canada Career Week 1997 .
this annual event is a reminder to young people and their parents of the importance of preparing today for the careers of tomorrow .
both the challenges and opportunities posed by the new knowledge based economy demand that extra efforts are made to equip Canadian youth with the skills and knowledge that they will need to succeed .
a top priority of the Government of Canada is to provide young people with the information and assistance they require to make informed career choices .
the programs and projects sponsored under the government ' s youth employment strategy are helping hundreds of thousands of young Canadians achieve their employment goals .
this year during Canada Career Week , the Government of Canada in co - operation with community partners participated in a series of activities , from career fairs in communities across the country to the production of new career information products .
these activities will help Canada ' s teenagers and young adults make a successful transition from school to work .

colonel FRED MOAR
Mr. Charles Hubbard ( Miramichi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is Veterans Week .
veterans in comparing our Canadian veterans program to those of other countries report that we have one of the best programs in the world .
in my constituency office , a veteran of World War II , Fred Moar , counsels and advises veterans and their families .
he has worked on a volunteer basis with three members of Parliament , Bud Jardine , Maurice Dionne and myself .
promoted as a young officer , he landed with A company on D - Day at St. Aubin sur Mer .
five days later he was the only surviving officer in the company .
that August he was promoted to company commander .
later he was wounded in Holland and returned to his unit some three weeks later .
he returned to Canada with the North Shore regiment in 1946 .
since then Colonel Moar has served as company commander , officer commanding -

remembrance DAY
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , on Tuesday , November 11 Canadians will mark a minute of silence for those who gave their lives for the freedom , democracy and peace we enjoy in this country today .
my father was one of those men .
he was a navigator in the RCAF and never returned from the second world war .
as a result , I grew up with only a photograph and the stories and memories passed on by my mother to tell me what a wonderful man my father was .
many of us can only imagine what it was like for those men like my father .
their sacrifice was so great and so meaningful we must never forget the contributions made during the wars .
no words can convey that to anyone .
therefore as the House will not be sitting on Remembrance Day , I ask that we remember November 11 is not a holiday .
it is a day to remember those who fought and died for this wonderful country .
* * *
remembrance DAY
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua ( Vaughan - King - Aurora , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , next Tuesday Canadians across the nation will honour the brave men and women who have given their lives in the world wars , the Korean war and in international peacekeeping efforts .
they are our heroes and have left us a legacy we can be proud of .
so it is right that we bow our heads on the 11 th hour of the 11 th day of the 11 th month to commemorate this ultimate sacrifice .
all across Canada we stop , we remember .
in my riding of Vaughan - King - Aurora there will be parades , wreath laying ceremonies and a moment of silence .
i know that I will use that moment to reflect on the progress we have made as a nation and as a society .

environment
Mr. Brent St. Denis ( Algoma - Manitoulin , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , global climate change presents one of the most significant challenges the world has ever faced .
reducing greenhouse gases will take a concerted and co - operative effort by the world ' s nations when they meet next month in Kyoto , Japan to reach an agreement to solve this problem .
our government is consulting with many stakeholders in advance of the Kyoto summit so that Canada makes a solid , balanced and positive contribution through realistic and attainable goals on greenhouse gas emissions .
while the issue of global climate change is a challenging one , it also presents a number of important opportunities for Canadian companies and know - how .
canada has long been a leader in the development and export of environmentally sound technology .
the worldwide effort to reduce greenhouse gases will result in a growing foreign market for Canadian expertise abroad and the creation of jobs at home .
as chairman of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Government Operations , I look forward to studying ways of assisting Canadian companies and workers to benefit fully from the opportunity this challenge presents .
canada will be a full and co - operative participant in the worldwide drive to control the emission of greenhouse gases .
future generations deserve our best efforts .

member FOR BOURASSA
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is with sadness and bitterness that I take the floor today , following yesterday ' s comment by the member for Bourassa who , in a stement worthy of Howard Stern , said that 49.4 % of Quebeckers were " colonized separatists acting like colonials '' .
Pierre Falardeau may have created Elvis Gratton , but I sometimes think the Prime Minister recruited him in his party .

women ENTREPRENEURS
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( London West , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I recently reviewed a copy of the Bank of Montreal study on the economic power of women - led firms in Canada entitled " Myths and Realities '' .
they are creating jobs at four times the national average .
these firms employ 1.7 million Canadians and provide 200,000 more jobs than the largest 100 Canadian companies combined .
i also congratulate the Minister for International Trade who will shortly be leading a delegation of female business people to Washington .

human LIFE
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the events of the last few days have given me occasion to once again evaluate at a very deep level the value of human life .
you see , Mr. Speaker , my sister Marian was born with cerebral palsy , injured at birth because of errors made by medical staff .
my parents accepted their responsibility for her and she became a very important part of our family .
she has never learned to speak and has required total care all her life .
but she laughs and sometimes she cries .
she loves to sing along when my mother or I play hymns on the piano , although her only words are " da , da , da '' .
Marian has added so much to our family , helping us not to become consumed with secular pursuits and keeping our focus on that which is truly important in life .
some would say that her life is not worthwhile , but I profoundly disagree .
thank you , my dear sister for loving us and accepting our love for the last 52 years .
* * *
tax AVOIDANCE
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to draw the attention of the house to Project Loophole .
choices , a Winnipeg based coalition for social justice , is challenging in the Federal Court of Canada in Toronto the $ 2.2 billion family trust tax manoeuvre identified and criticized by the Auditor General of Canada .
the case is to be heard later this month .
choices is to be commended for pursuing this issue .
tax avoidance is one of the far too hidden dimensions of why the government finds itself without the revenues it needs .
yet this same government not only does not cite tax avoidance as a factor in its fiscal situation that needs to be dealt with , instead it actively encourages tax avoidance by sending departmental officials to act as resource persons at privately sponsored tax avoidance workshops on tax shelters , offshore havens , et cetera .
it is no surprise really .
when we see the kinds of prices the Liberals are able to charge for their fund - raising dinners , we know that their real friends are folks with lots of taxes to be avoided .
the ordinary Canadian will be getting his or her CPP reduced and their public services -

MANITOBA FARM WOMEN
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise in the House today with great pride to recognize the week of November 3 to 9 as Manitoba Farm Women ' s Week .
Manitoba farm women are essential to the life and the economic stability of the farm , family and community .
i would like to especially mention that the 1997 Manitoba Farm Women ' s Conference was held this week in my city of Brandon , Manitoba .
the conference entitled " Neighbours en route to 2000 " featured sessions ranging from child care in rural Manitoba to getting online on the world wide web .
there also were presentations on equality , career planning and money management , to mention a few .
it is time that we as Canadians recognize the monumental contribution women have made to our agricultural industry and applaud them .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
employment
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , last night 1,500 people paid $ 500 each to attend the prime minister ' s exclusive fund - raising dinner .
i do not suppose many of them spend much time worrying about minor things like the Canada pension plan or unemployment .
however , for ordinary Canadians things just got a little rougher .
Canadians see the golf clubs , the caviar and the champagne so where are the job , jobs , jobs ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are disappointed that employment fell slightly in October but it followed seven consecutive months of solid job growth .
since the beginning of the year 268,000 new jobs have been created , which is nearly double the number of jobs created over the same period in 1996 .
unemployment is down nearly a full point from where it was a year ago .
therefore I am confident in saying that if we continue to work to create more jobs we will be accomplishing this with the policies that have worked well so far .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I suppose hope springs eternal in the heart of a Liberal , but he probably wrote that answer some time last night between cocktails and caviar .
we do not think there is an excuse for these numbers .
our number one trading partner and competitor , the United States , just reported that its unemployment rate is now 4.7 % , just half of what ours is .
across the border they are enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years .
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in response to the hon. member ' s question , let us talk about the headlines in the paper just this morning : " Dust off those resum 茅 s , the job market is heating up '' .
let us talk about the fact that Statistics Canada recently stated that the jobs are here and that the help wanted index has hit its highest level in almost seven years .
the help wanted index is an indication of where those jobs and the employment level will be in the future .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
are Canadians really sentenced to 9 % unemployment forever or just until the government is replaced ?
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , let me repeat for the hon. member that 268,000 new jobs have been created since the beginning of this year , nearly doubling the number of jobs created over the same period .
we will continue as a government to pursue the policies to ensure that employment is first and foremost in the numbers .
* * *
canada PENSION PLAN
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the finance minister told the House " there will not be an increase in CPP premiums beyond 9.9 % '' .
on the very same day the chief actuary of the Canada pension plan told the finance committee that there was no guarantee premiums would not rise beyond 9.9 % .
who are Canadians to believe , the finance minister or his chief actuary ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
if further action is necessary it will be taken .
we want to protect future generations .
we want to make sure they have a safe and secure pension at reasonable cost .
this is our commitment and we will achieve it .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the chief actuary reminded the finance committee yesterday that assumptions can " easily be off track " and acknowledged that projections " have been wrong in the past '' .
just yesterday we saw that within two months there was a change in projections of $ 41 billion in what would be in the CPP fund .
why does the government not admit to Canadians that it does not have a clue how much its broken CPP pyramid scheme will cost us in the future ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , why does the Reform Party not admit that its alternative to the Canada pension plan is to submit present and future generations to the vagaries of the market ?
Canadians do not want the Reform Bre - X alternative to the safe and secure Canada pension plan ?
* * *
child SUPPORT
Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs .
we learn in this morning ' s issue of Le Soleil that an agreement between Ottawa and Quebec with respect to the proposed agreement between France and Quebec regarding the collection of support payments is apparently impossible .
Quebec , however , is still ready to negotiate and has even shown its willingness to discuss the terms of the agreement that is bothering Ottawa .
with Quebec still prepared to negotiate with the federal government , will the minister admit that the statements from anonymous sources within his government may well derail the negotiation process ?
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , there is no question of commenting on the so - called anonymous sources , but it is very good news that the Government of Quebec is ready to negotiate , because so are we .
Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , can the minister assure us that his government has not used this issue , which is too important for the 200 women and their children waiting for support payments , for its own political ends , and that it will not do so in future ?
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is a question the hon. member would do better to ask her own party .
* * *
employment INSURANCE
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
after a first announcement in the budget speech and another during the election campaign , the government ought to soon be making an official announcement on the EI contribution rate that will be in effect next year .
everyone now acknowledges that a substantial drop in the employment insurance contribution rate would stimulate job creation .
for once , does the government intend -
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , each year since we have been in government , we have regularly , taking into consideration the overall problem of public finances , tried to reduce the employment insurance contribution , and we have indeed reduced it regularly .
and it is clearly the intention of the government to look at it , each time it is financially feasible .
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , over the past four years the government has managed to wrest $ 19 billion from the unemployed and the employed , by pocketing the annual surpluses from the fund in order to improve the deficit figures .
when will the minister put an end to this scandalous misappropriation of public funds ?
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I do not share the opinions of my hon. colleague in the opposition .
it is very clear , where employment insurance is concerned , that we have carried out an in depth reform in order to help those people in this country who are looking for work .
looking at the results over the years , one can say that the outcome has been satisfactory , even though we would like to see a marked improvement .
it is therefore very clear that , as soon as we can do so , we will decrease contributions still further .
* * *
employment
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , 24,000 more Canadians are out of work since September .
twenty - four thousand more families are wondering how they will pay for their groceries , how they will pay their rent and how they will get through Christmas .
when will the government admit that it is not getting things right , that unemployment is a continuing problem which its policies are not addressing , and that it needs to do something different ?
will the government please explain why we have had a continuous 9 % rate of unemployment for 85 months now ?
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , once again I point out that 268,000 new jobs have been created .
there is no doubt that it is true employment fell slightly in October , but this followed seven consecutive months of solid job growth .
month to month fluctuations in employment estimates are not unusual .
we have to look at the long term trend in employment over longer periods .
in fact the policies of the government have been very effective in ensuring that those employment numbers have gone up .
we will continue to ensure that the employment numbers improve .
the government is committed to that .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would call 85 months a long term trend .
the long term trend is that unemployment has been at 9 % for 85 months .
just let these policies work '' .
these policies have been in place and they are not working .
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Statistics Canada recently reported that the jobs are here .
the help wanted index is going up .
it is the highest it has been in seven years .
the help wanted index is the indicator of where the employment numbers will be in the future .
the numbers will improve in the future .
we will continue to follow those policies and we will ensure that Canadians who want to work will have the opportunity to work because of the policies of the government .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the government which is in denial on unemployment .
it continues to spout numbers .
i do not think unemployed families today who are listening to this question period will be very impressed by the statistics .
rather , I would like to know why the government is not listening to the business community which repeatedly asks the government to reduce employment insurance premium rates so that we can create more jobs .
why does it not act on this basic , simple recommendation which would allow more Canadians to get back into the labour market ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the question of the leader of the Conservative Party is amazing since the unemployment insurance rates reached record highs when he was in government .
furthermore , we have been steadily bringing down those rates since the record highs of the Conservative government .
it is our intention to continue to do so .
speaking of the private sector , the Bank of Montreal said that this year ' s job growth , which is expected to total 376,000 by year end , will continue through 1998 , with a further -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Sherbrooke .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , with all due respect , the Deputy Prime Minister ' s answer is exactly what is wrong with the government .
when will the government grow up and stop blaming others for the unemployment situation ?
when will it stop saying that the dog ate its homework ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the leader of the Conservative Party should not use question period to give Canadians watching on TV a totally inaccurate impression of the facts .
we have not been raising unemployment insurance premiums .
we have been reducing them .
it was the Conservative government of which he was a part that let them go to record levels .
i have to admire his nerve to try to change the reality and facts of what happened .
we will be repairing the mess made of the economy by the leader of the Conservative Party and his government .
no wonder they were destroyed .

KREVER INQUIRY
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
my question for the government today is will it follow every single recommendation that Judge Krever presents for Canadians ?
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government is looking forward to the report of Judge Krever .
we have recognized that this is a piece of work that has been expansive , that will direct us with a very important initiative .
i know the Minister of Health will welcome that report and act on it as he can .
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , those are very reassuring words .
Judy C . , a patient who was infected with hepatitis C when she had a simple tooth extraction , wrote to me and said this government blocked Krever in court , withheld very important documents .
she is not encourage at all with the record of this government on Krever .
her question is why would anybody trust the government on this issue when it looks like it is just trying to dress up an old skeleton with new clothes in its brand new interim policy on blood ?
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is presuming response .
what I have indicated and what the hon. Minister of Health has continued to indicate is that he is welcoming the report from Justice Krever , that we will review it in its entirety and we will make an appropriate response when we receive the report .

immigration
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration .
there is an agreement between the federal government and the Government of Quebec that permits Quebec to provide most services to immigrants newly arrived in Quebec .
how does the minister explain the fact that charges Quebec immigrants have to pay are the same as in other provinces ?
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , when does the minister intend to adjust the charges to reflect only the services provided by her department and nothing else ?
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I understand my colleague from Hochelaga - Maisonneuve to be requesting the reopening of the Canada - Quebec agreement so we could consider the matter .
i am quite prepared to do so .

the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the countdown to Kyoto is on .
the Liberals are going to Japan in about 23 days and we still do not even know what the Canadian position will be .
what is so incredible here is the Liberal government has agreed to bind us to a contract , yet Canadians do not know the terms of the contract or what the impact will be .
why does Canada have the only government that is going to Kyoto without a plan and without knowing how much it is going to cost us ?
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Reform has been exhibiting a severe weather fluctuation in this House .
on the one hand it is demanding that we consult with the provinces and stakeholders , and on the other hand it is demanding that we stop this consultation .
the minister and her hon. colleague , the Minister of Natural Resources , are going to be meeting with their provincial counterparts and they will be discussing this very important issue , just as Reform has suggested .
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , there seems to be some confusion .
what the Reform Party is demanding is what Canadians are demanding .
i have received in my office literally hundreds of signatures on petitions demanding the Liberal government not sign a legally binding treaty in Kyoto until the public has been given a chance to review the costs and impacts of such a deal .
instead of respecting the wishes of ordinary Canadians this government is forcing a top down agenda .
Canadians want real solutions to the environment , not new taxes .
will this government publicly put forward solid solutions before signing secret contracts in Kyoto ?
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the only one who has been talking about taxes is the Reform environment critic and he has been jailed for a week in the Reform bingo hall .

dairy INDUSTRY
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie ( Louis - H 茅 bert , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food .
the World Trade Organization hearings on the Canada - United States dispute on the pricing of export milk are scheduled to open on November 19 .
following his October 31 meeting with representatives from the dairy industry , can the minister assure us that every effort will be made to support the dairy industry in this major dispute ?
Mr. John Harvard ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for the question .
i want to assure the hon. member that we , as a federal government , will respect all our trade obligations .
we think our dairy pricing policy and the tariff rate quotas for fluid milk do comply with all our trade obligations .
i assure the hon. member we will defend our policies before any trade panel .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie ( Louis - H 茅 bert , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my supplementary concerns the importation of oil , butter and sugar mixtures .
in light of the loss of income experienced by our producers and seeing that time is of the essence , does the minister intend to do everything he can and quickly to get his colleagues to act on this issue ?
Mr. John Harvard ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I assure the hon. member this is a matter that concerns the federal government and the minister of agriculture .
in fact , the minister met with dairy farmers on this very issue just last week .
it is a difficult situation but I can assure the hon. member that when we deal with it we will take into account the various issues involved .
we are also speaking with the other departments of government , namely revenue and finance .
these departments are also involved in this issue .

infrastructure
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it seems that the political minister for B.C. has been funnelling quite a bit of infrastructure money into his own riding .
in fact , the riding of Victoria has received double the per capita allotment for approved projects .
is the minister funnelling money into his own riding to buy votes or is he punishing the rest of the region for voting Reform ?
the Speaker :
the question is out of order .
the second question .
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the minister has approved bike paths and buses in his riding and is denying basic -

pay EQUITY
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the President of the Treasury Board .
the Bloc Quebecois is pleased to learn that the minister has finally decided to go back to the negotiating table with the Public Service Alliance of Canada , to settle the issue of pay equity .
can the minister tell this House whether the Minister of Finance gave him the necessary leeway to finally bring this issue to its conclusion ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Bloc Quebecois member should not interpret the facts so loosely , because the Treasury Board has always been willing to negotiate .
in April , we indicated that we were prepared to put $ 1 billion on the table .
we added $ 300 million in mid - August to arrive at an amount that must be discussed or negotiated with the union .
the hon. member should use her influence on the unions and ask them to negotiate now .

small BUSINESS
Mr. David Pratt ( Nepean - Carleton , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is addressed to the Minister of National Revenue .
while the entrepreneurial spirit is alive an well in my own riding of Nepean - Carleton , there is often frustration among small business owners about the complexity of information provided by the government .
i would like to ask the Minister of National Revenue what steps are being taken by his department to provide comprehensive , easily understood information for small business .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate the member for Nepean - Carleton who has expressed tremendous interest in small business .
this morning I introduced a new guide for Canadian small business to make sure that the information it gets is focused and clear .
i also congratulate the small business advisory committee which helped Revenue Canada put this together .
i assure Canadians that small business is very important .
we all know it is small businesses that are generating the jobs in this economy .
we are committed to small business , to ensuring that we help -

CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , for three years CIDA has asked the government to establish an aid effectiveness advisory committee , a watchdog to monitor Canada ' s aid programs .
in response to my question last week , the government cites other priorities , including Liberal budget cuts to CIDA , as reasons not to establish a watchdog to hunt down questionable CIDA spending .
why is the minister responsible for CIDA trying to hide behind the so - called other priorities ?
what is the government afraid of , the watchdog -
the Speaker :
the hon. secretary of state .
hon. Raymond Chan ( Secretary of State ( Asia - Pacific ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , CIDA has a very transparent open bidding system to award contracts .
if the hon. member has other information , we invite him to come forward .
the CIDA open bidding system has been transparent and is well accepted by the business community .
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. secretary does not know that .
the fact is the committee has not yet been established so that the government may continue taking political advantage of CIDA .
CIDA has about 130 auditors from 49 countries trained by Canadian taxpayer dollars .
CIDA ' s accountability , transparency , reputation and credibility are in question .
why does the minister refuse to use those auditors who are trained in Canada ?
hon. Raymond Chan ( Secretary of State ( Asia - Pacific ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , CIDA ' s budget has annually been audited by the auditor general .
the bidding system has been open and transparent .
this kind of reference only hurts our ability to help third world countries .

canada PENSION PLAN
hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is to the deputy prime minister .
yesterday the prime minister characterized the CPP fight as between those with a social conscience and social Darwinists , who he said believe in the survival of the fattest .
it is ironic that the prime minister made those statements yesterday in Toronto at a $ 500 a plate dinner to fat cat Liberals .
how can the government pretend to believe in a social conscience when the brunt of the premium hikes and the cutback in benefits under CPP will fall hardest on those with low income , elderly women and those with disabilities ?
how can he say that ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we reject the premise of the hon. member ' s question .
our reforms of the Canada pension plan , which have been worked out in co - operation with eight of the provinces , are designed to help middle and lower income Canadians .
they are designed to respect the needs of women and people with families .
we want to have a safe and secure pension plan for all Canadians and especially those of lower and medium income .
we reject the approach of the Reform Party which wants to destroy that system .
it is about time the NDP joins with us in what we are trying to do to help ordinary Canadians .
hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , give me a break .
the Deputy Prime Minister has gone to too many of those fat cat $ 500 dinners .
the only time the government ' s changes look good is in comparison to the Reform Party , which wants to abolish the CPP .
why has this government not done an impact study on those changes and the effect of those changes on the income of future seniors , particularly women ?
no impact study has every been done .
why has it not been done and why will it not be done now and tabled before this house ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the reforms to the Canada pension plan arose not only through consultations with the provinces , but consultations with all sorts of stakeholder groups .
therefore , the concerns of my hon. friend have been taken into account .
these are matters that could be considered further in parliamentary hearings and parliamentary debate .
however , the issues raised by my hon. friend are very much on the mind of the government .
we believe they have been taken into account .
the reforms we are putting forward to the Canada pension plan are to ensure the safety of the pensions for all Canadians , particularly lower and middle income Canadians and groups such as women , handicapped and needy people across the country .
why will the NDP not realize this and join with us to make sure that these reforms go through to protect the plan for future generations ?

the ENVIRONMENT
Ms. Diane St - Jacques ( Shefford , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , this week the Prime Minister destroyed the last remaining Canadian land mine , but a similar problem still exists in my riding of Shefford .
for a number of years now , pieces of shells and rockets from World War II appear when the snow melts .
can we hope that the Prime Minister will attach the same importance to ridding Canada of such devices as he does to mineclearing in the rest of the world ?
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
the government has a major program under way to do that .
there is , of course , concern that this clean - up will involve substantial amounts of time as well as money .
but on behalf of the Minister of National Defence , I would be delighted to examine the particular case in the member ' s riding .
Ms. Diane St - Jacques ( Shefford , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am happy to hear that the government is committed to looking at this problem , but I think more than that is required .
before the Ottawa treaty is signed in December , should we not bring in legislation to eliminate devices left over from World War II by our army and its subcontractors ?
if we do not do it for the environment , could we not do it for the safety of our children , before there is a serious accident ?
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I certainly appreciate the sentiment of the hon. member .
it is a little difficult , however , to legislate simply by a decision of this Parliament to somehow make good a problem that has existed since the second world war and is a physical problem in or on the surface of the ground .
i can promise the member that the concern she has expressed , which is particularly important in areas where children may get through a fence or wall into an area where there is such a dangerous situation , is a major concern .
i am sure the opinions expressed by the hon. member are shared by every member of the House .

infrastructure
Ms. Paddy Torsney ( Burlington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government has placed important and appropriate emphasis on renewing Canada ' s infrastructure .
could the President of the Treasury Board tell us today how he has allowed Canadian municipalities to fund progressive infrastructure to benefit Canadians equitably ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to announce that the federal government is providing funding for nine metro Toronto daycare facilities under the Canada - Ontario infrastructure program .
in collaboration with our partners in this program , we will be providing a $ 1 million contribution which will help to respond to the needs of all the stakeholders .
the federal government is meeting its commitment to metro Toronto and to Canada ' s children .

senate
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canadians believe in making our political institutions more democratic .
Albertans have led the way by electing their first senator in 1989 .
with all provincial parties in favour of electing a senator from Alberta , will the Prime Minister listen to the people of Alberta and their request for Senate elections ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we certainly are sensitive to the views of the people of Alberta , as well as those of every part of the country .
but we have to respect the Constitution as it is , which says that senators are appointed by the Government of Canada .
certainly we intend to respect the law while taking into account the views of people of every part of this country .

canada LABOUR CODE
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅 ( L 茅 vis , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is to the Minister of Labour .
in his reform of the Canada Labour Code , the minister insists on maintaining the possibility of using strike breakers .
why is the minister so intend on allowing this , since he knows full well , as the Quebec experience has demonstrated , that prohibiting scabs tends to make labour relations more civilized ?
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Bill C - 19 was tabled yesterday in the House of Commons .
we are going to address many problems in this bill .

crisis CENTRES
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice .
every 17 minutes a sexual assault is committed somewhere in Canada .
one in four women will be sexually abused at some point in her life .
there is a need like never before for safe houses , shelters and rape crisis centres .
why then is the government quibbling over a million dollar expenditure for such centres ?
will the government assure Canadian women today that , as a very minimum , the million dollars a year for five years for crisis centres as promised by the former Minister of Justice will be allocated immediately ?
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Treasury Board is now overlooking the funding for the government ' s family violence initiative .
the CASAC proposal which is I think is the proposal to which the hon. member is referring requires more than two - thirds of the funds that the department expects to receive from Treasury Board .
at the moment , we have 20 proposals for $ 1.2 million , including one from the group of aboriginal women who want to establish a program to build life skills of women .
we are in the process of studying these proposals .

agriculture
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , Nova Scotia farmers have been devastated twice this year : first by the worst drought in 100 years resulting in a loss of up to 50 % of forage and grain crops and second , by the callousness of the minister of agriculture toward this critical event .
farmers are seeking emergency relief .
will the Prime Minister intervene now and save farming in Nova Scotia ?
Mr. John Harvard ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member for the question .
i will take his question as notice and when I have my first opportunity to speak to the minister , I will apprise him of his concern .
i am sure he will get an answer back from the minister of agriculture .
* * *
industrial RESEARCH
Mr. Eug 猫 ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , during the last election , the government promised to increase funding to the Council for Assistance to Industrial Research sponsored by the National Research Council .
could the Secretary of State for Science and Technology outline the reasons for such a commitment , which I personally consider positive and necessary ?
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel ( Secretary of State ( Science , Research and Development ) ( Western Economic Diversification ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this industrial research assistance program , which is managed by the National Research Council , is an excellent government program , and everyone agrees with that .
every year in Canada , it creates up to 10,000 full time , high quality jobs .
this program provides assistance to 10,000 businesses .
our consultants , the people who provide this information , come from every region in the country .
they come from 140 organizations across Canada .
this program is especially designed for young people .

justice
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Minister of Justice stated that the House of Commons is not the place to discuss issues such as euthanasia and mercy killings .
Canadians were pretty shocked by that comment .
if this is not the place to debate issues such as euthanasia and mercy killing , then where is the place to discuss such issues ?
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I did not see the quote to which the member referred , but there are issues before this House on mercy killing , on euthanasia , and they will be debated , as is being done with the private members ' motion .
* * *
pay EQUITY
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , in light of the response we have just got from the President of Treasury Board on pay equity , I will have another try at it .
can the minister be more serious and tell me whether , yes or no , his colleague in finance has given him more than $ 1.3 billion to negotiate with ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government considers pay equity an extremely important problem , and we wish to resolve this matter as quickly as possible .
we have already allocated $ 1.3 billion for settlement of this question .
we have indicated that we want a response as quickly as possible , and I would again encourage my hon. colleague to put pressure on the union so that it will finally find a response that suits the requirements of our employees .

veterans AFFAIRS
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister .
he will be aware that in the late thirties hundreds of Canadians volunteered to go to Spain to fight against fascism prior to the second world war .
the Deputy Prime Minister will be aware that there is only a handful of survivors of the Mackenzie - Papineau brigade living today .
he will also know that of 54 countries , 52 have recognized them as veterans and they are receiving the benefits of veterans .
would the Deputy Prime Minister indicate today whether the government , on the eve of Remembrance Day , is at least considering recognizing this handful of veterans from the Spanish civil war who are still alive today and offering them veteran status ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
i would be happy to take the matter under advisement , together with my colleague , the Minister of Veteran ' s Affairs , and get back to my hon. friend when I have further information on this important suggestion .

fisheries
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the divestiture of the Nova Scotia salmon hatcheries has been stated by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans as being for the betterment of the public fishery in Nova Scotia .
the escapement from the rivers , the escapement from hatcheries , were as good for this year as in previous years from the fish that returned .
however at - sea conditions resulted in a very substantial reduction .
it is a major matter of concern for the government .
however , there are many factors involved , not simply hatcheries , and I will be happy to discuss them with the member more fully when I have more than 35 seconds , which is what the Speaker allows me at question period .

land CLAIMS
Mr. Stan Dromisky ( Thunder Bay - Atikokan , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , over the past few weeks there have been important land claims negotiations between the federal government , the Labrador Inuit Association and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador .
could the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development please update the House on the status of these negotiations ?
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
i trust they will lead us to an agreement in principle on this very important land claim and self - government agreement .
i congratulate all the parties involved because it was difficult .
i commit the government to a quick return to the table to finish that agreement in principle as soon as possible .

health CARE
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , in an appearance before the finance committee a very credible witness said : " Continuing cuts to health care across the country have been dramatic and Canadians are paying the price .
the medicare patchwork is becoming threadbare '' .
Canadians queuing up for operations and laid off nurses agree with her .
if the government will not listen to waiting patients , if it will not listen to laid - off nurses , if it will not listen to the Reform Party , will it at least listen to one of its own , the wife of a deputy prime minister , and move quickly to restore much needed health transfer payments ?
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as part of the election platform presented by what is now this government , we identified the important need to modernize health care .
we identified the need for home care and pharmacare .
we have identified a number of strategies to which the hon. Minister of Health is responding .
it is my clear partnership with him to identify that the biggest input was to restore funding to $ 12.5 billion as was requested by the National Forum on Health .
the Speaker :
on a point of order , the hon. government whip , or , excuse me , Reform whip .

Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order regarding what happened in question period today , specifically during the questions by the member for Dewdney - Alouette .
however , in the supplementary when the member started to talk about the infrastructure program and some of the problems with the infrastructure program in British Columbia , before he had directed his question in this case to the minister in charge of that infrastructure program you rose and cut him off and ruled it out of order again .
the Speaker :
during the course of question period usually when certain words are used I do not know where the member is going a lot of the time .

Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :

committees OF THE HOUSE
QUEBEC SCHOOL SYSTEM
Mr. Denis Paradis ( Brome - Missisquoi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the Report of the Special Joint Committee to amend Section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 , concerning the Quebec School System .
as the member for Brome - Missisquoi , I simply want to say that the linguistic school boards Quebec is seeking to establish are similar to what we have had for about 15 years in my riding of Brome - Missisquoi , and I must say that the two linguistic communities in my riding live in perfect harmony .
we heard many stakeholders , and our joint committee conducted a high level debate .
as a Quebecker , I am proud to note that the Quebec government just took an important step by requesting this amendment in compliance with the provisions of the Constitution Act , 1982 .
in conclusion , I would like to read the conclusion of the joint committee ' s report :
we recommend that the two houses of Parliament adopt the resolution to amend section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 , as tabled in the House of Commons on October 1 , 1997 , and in the Senate on October 9 , 1997 .
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to say at the outset that the caucus of the Reform Party strongly believes that education is exclusively under provincial jurisdiction and that it is essential that this be fully respected .
however , we might add that the proposed amendment does not address minority language educational rights or the establishment of linguistic school boards .
what is at stake here is the denominational rights protected by section 93 of the Constitution .
amendments to the Constitution should never be passed without due consideration or in haste .
we believe that before any constitutional amendment is passed , Parliament must make sure there is democratic consent , that the amendment respects the rule of law and that it is in the national interest .
if it adversely affects enshrined minority rights , Parliament must be especially careful that the democratic consent includes indisputable agreement on the part of the minority .
we have come to the conclusion that the motion does not meet these requirements .
first , the Reform Party would rather see a provincial referendum before Parliament considers any amendment under section 93 .
third , this committee should ensure that what it proposes meets the second requirement : respecting the rule of law .
is the appropriate amending formula being used ?
most witnesses we have heard therefore took it for granted .
in fact , we should not expect this committee to settle the issue in haste -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
i am sorry to interrupt , but the hon. member for Malpeque has the floor , on a point of order .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
is the member reading the report or tabling the report ?
i think he is taking too long to table the report .
he seems to be reading it .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. parliamentary secretary is correct .
by custom the response should not be any longer than the initial tabling .
the hon. member for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve has requested unanimous consent of the House to speak to the tabling of this report with a few short words .
does the hon. member for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve have the unanimous consent of the House to speak to this report ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleagues for their consent .
i also thank the government , the member for Brome - Missisquoi , and our Senate colleague , who made it possible for us to work in a calm atmosphere culminating in almost complete unanimity .
i wish to emphasize that the Bloc Quebecois is very much in favour of and very pleased with the contents of the report tabled .
we hope to be able to follow up as quickly as possible on the vote to be held in the House .
once again , we have the feeling we are favourably representing the will of the National Assembly and think that this is a very positive occasion for all parliamentarians .
bill C - 11
Mr. Eug 猫 ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the first report of the Standing Committee on Industry .
in accordance with its order of reference of October 24 , 1997 , the committee has considered Bill C - 11 , an act respecting the imposition of duties and customs .
bill C - 10
Mr. Eug 猫 ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the second report of the Standing Committee on Industry .
in accordance with its order of reference of October 29 , 1997 the committee has considered Bill C - 10 , an act to implement a convention between Canada and Sweden , a convention between Canada and various other countries .
the purpose of this bill is to avoid double taxation and to prevent fiscal evasion with respect to income tax .
we have agreed to report it without amendment .

Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present the 10 th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs regarding the associate membership of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage .
if the House gives its consent , I intend to move concurrence in the 10 th report later this day .
agriculture AND AGRI - FOOD
Mr. Joe McGuire ( Egmont , Lib . ) :

criminal CODE
Mr. Speaker , I rise in the House to introduce a bill calling for a binding national referendum on the reinstatement of capital punishment as a sentencing option for those convicted of first degree murder .
in doing so I thank my colleague , the member for Dewdney - Alouette , for seconding the bill and all other members who have jointly seconded the bill .
the bill represents Reform Party policy on the issue and allows Canadians to decide this matter for themselves .
indeed for too long , in fact forever , Canadians have been shut out of this debate .
critics will try to misrepresent this initiative by saying the bill is about reinstatement of the death penalty when it is clearly not .
the bill is about having a referendum on the matter and it is from that perspective I hope members of the House will engage in debate on the matter .

criminal CODE
Mr. Speaker , today I am reintroducing my firearms law sunset act .
i would like to thank the member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough for seconding the bill .
the Minister of Justice tabled 62 pages of firearms regulations last week and they suffer the same problem as the bill that authorized them .
no one knows if this bureaucratic mumbo - jumbo and hundreds of millions of tax dollars will improve public safety , reduce the criminal use of firearms or save lives .
nor can anyone in this government tell law - abiding gun owners or taxpayers what it will do if it does not improve public safety .
the firearms law sunset act solves this uncertainty for gun owners and -
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
they do not give a speech about it .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. parliamentary secretary is quite correct .
the introduction of a private member ' s bill may not enter into the realm of debate .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz :
Mr. Speaker , I will describe the bill .
i believe all laws in this House must be cost effective and achieve their stated goal .

observance OF TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE ON REMEMBRANCE DAY ACT
Mr. Speaker , this is a simple bill which is designed to formalize a custom which unfortunately is on the wane in Canada .
it would invite the people of Canada to observe two minutes of silence on Remembrance Day in their places of work , in schools , in any possible way .
it is a bill that is designed on a similar piece of legislation which was recently passed in the Ontario legislature and designed on a motion that passed the Westminister parliament a couple of years ago .
it would not require anything of the Canadian people but simply to call their attention to the importance respecting this longstanding tradition of observing these moments of silence in respect of our war dead .

petitions
public NUDITY
Mr. Joe McGuire ( Egmont , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I would like to present a petition on behalf of the constituents of Prince Edward Island who are concerned about the explicit nudity in public places which is becoming quite frequent .
there are laws in Canada to protect children against this form of nudity in all media , but currently there are no laws protecting children in public places .
therefore the petitioners call upon Parliament to enact legislation to amend the Criminal Code , specifically sections 173 and 174 , the indecent act and public nudity provisions , to clearly state that a woman exposing her breasts in a public place is an indecent act .
herbal SUPPLEMENTS
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to present a petition to the House calling for the elimination of Bill C - 8 and any other offending legislation that unduly regulates the use of herbal supplements .
conservative estimates show that over six million Canadians rely on herbal supplements .
these people do not want their health care choices limited and they do not want to see the cost of these products increase as the result of unnecessary costly government regulations .
i applaud the Minister of Health on his recent decision to seek advice from a committee for amendments to the Food and Drugs Act that would affect these products .
income TAX ACT
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have three brief petitions to present today .
the first one has to do with the family .
the petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its value to our society .
they also point out that the Income Tax Act does not take into account the cost of raising children in its provisions .
the petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to pursue initiatives to eliminate this discrimination against families who choose to provide direct care in the home to preschool children .
labelling OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the second petition has to do with alcohol misuse .
the petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that the consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems and particularly that fetal alcohol syndrome and other alcohol related birth defects are 100 % preventable by avoiding consumption during pregnancy .
the petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to mandate the labelling of alcoholic products to warn expectant mothers and others of the risks associated with alcohol consumption .
public SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION FUND
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the final petition has to do with our everyday heroes on the front line , police officers and firefighters .
the petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House that our police officers and firefighters are required to place their lives at risk on a daily basis and that the public mourns the loss when one of them loses their life in the line of duty .
the petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to establish a public safety officers compensation fund for the benefit of families of police officers , firefighters and other public safety officers who lose their lives in the line of duty .
goods AND SERVICES TAX
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , on behalf of the citizens of Kamloops , I want to associate our views with that of the member for Mississauga South who has just presented three petitions .
we would certainly go on record as endorsing those three petitions .
perhaps I can ask the same of my hon. friend .
the first petition I wish to present refers to the GST being applied to books .
these few hundred petitioners from throughout British Columbia are urging the government to demonstrate support of education and literacy by eliminating the sales tax on reading materials .
they also ask Parliament to zero rate books , magazines and newspapers under the GST .
also they say that as the provinces and Ottawa consider harmonizing their sales taxes , reading materials must be zero rated under the provincial sales taxes as well as the GST .
criminal CODE
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the second petition is a large one .
this brings to a total of nearly 15,000 names from the greater Kamloops area that are on record as asking the government to remove section 745 of the Criminal Code which they say allows murderers to apply for a reduction in the number of years of imprisonment notwithstanding having been tried , convicted and sentenced in a court of law .
i agree with their sentiment .
they are asking Parliament to simply eliminate section 745 .
taxation
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , on another matter , petitioners from Kamloops and Clearwater , British Columbia outline a large list of reasons why the present tax system needs to be changed .
i will not go into the reasons because they are already clear on the public record .
they are simply calling upon the Government of Canada to consider introducing major tax reform and re - examining the recommendations made , I believe it was in the sixties , by the Carter commission on tax reform .
assisted SUICIDE
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , finally on the matter of euthanasia , the petitioners primarily under the leadership of Ursula Bond from Clearwater , British Columbia are simply asking Parliament to ensure that the present provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada prohibiting assisted suicide be enforced vigorously , and that Parliament make no change in the law that would sanction or allow the aiding or abetting of suicide or active or passive euthanasia .
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour and privilege to rise in the House today to present a petition on behalf of the people of Surrey Central and other regions of British Columbia .
the petition concerns Yasmine Reddy , a Canadian citizen who was abducted from Canada by her mother , Nadia Reddy , on February 16 , 1997 and remains a hostage trapped in Amman , Jordan .
this petition is signed by 83 persons and calls on the federal government to act to have Yasmine Reddy safely and promptly returned to Canada and to ask the King of Jordan to issue a royal decree to repatriate Yasmine Asha Christine Reddy back to Canada .

questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :

some hon. members :
agreed .
government ORDERS
criminal CODE
the House resumed consideration of Bill C - 16 , an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Interpretation Act ( powers to arrest and enter dwellings ) , as reported ( with amendment ) from the committee ; and of Motions Nos. 3 and 5 .
hon. Don Boudria :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i believe if you were to seek it , you would find unanimous consent to revert to Motion No. 2 .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
on a point of order , the hon. chief government , the whip of the official opposition .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , all the speakers are having trouble with that today .
it is prophetic .
i feel this matter can be given unanimous consent , but I want to rise to address it on two points .
the reason we are reverting to deal with this motion is that the government ' s process on how it has handled this whole bill and the amendments surrounding this bill along with the amendments to the bill itself has been so seriously flawed that , as it is trying to rush it through this House , mistakes were made earlier this day by people forcing a vote on this amendment .
the government does not want an amendment because it wants it pushed through today and today it must go through .
none of us on this side of the House want to hold that up .
however , what has happened is another example of what happens in this place when legislation is brought in at the last minute , when it is rushed through committee where there is no chance of bringing in amendments like this , when there is no chance to bring expert opinion to bear on amendments , when there is not an opportunity to hear all sides of it .
that is what happens when this stuff is pushed through .
i said as much in committee .
i want to repeat it here again today .
this is a problem with the flawed process of last minute , last ditch , knife at your throat , let us get this thing passed or else attitude that the government brings on this legislation .
it is wrong , wrong , wrong .
i just want to point out that we are reverting to this motion because the process is so flawed .
i also want to caution the Speaker in accepting this motion .
there have been discussions with all parties and we are in agreement to revert to this motion to deal with it .
however earlier today , five members at least stood in their place and demanded a recorded vote on this motion .
the caution I have on that is what if those five members have now left the Chamber to do other duties and are not here to deal with the unanimous consent ?
i just want to go on record to say that this cannot be construed as a precedent setting incident .
it is only because the government House leader assures me that the members who stood on his side of the House and asked for this vote are in agreement with this and will not be coming back on the House and accusing anyone in here of somehow doing something inappropriate in the democratic process .
Mr. Speaker , I want to make sure that it is absolutely clear that at any time in the future when five members stand to force a vote we do not reconsider that vote unless there is agreement by all parties and agreement by the five members who stood .
i hope on those two counts the government is paying attention , that the department is paying attention and that we will not be dealing with this sort of sausage making factory when we should be dealing with legislative debate in a serious manner .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to say briefly that the point made by the Reform Party whip is a good one .
i too very much regret that we have to do what we are doing .
this would be a bad precedent if it in any way were to be understood as a precedent .
i think this needs to be understood as an aberration .
i think the point is well made that one could certainly imagine a future circumstance in which the leadership of all parties , in fact all parties , might conspire to overturn the will of five members who might not have been acting in concert with their parties , causing a vote to be taken by standing and forcing a recorded division .
this should in no way be seen as a precedent in respect of any future circumstance .
in the future we would have to have guarantees , as we have today , that the members who caused the vote to be taken were in agreement with the procedure we are now following .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to confirm to the House that this is not considered by the government as being a precedent .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
before we take the vote on unanimous consent , the Chair takes this very seriously and has duly noted all the comments made by all the members on both sides of the Chamber concerning this bill .
the Chair also recognizes that a precedent is not set when unanimous consent is requested .
any member of the House may deny unanimous consent and therefore a precedent is not set .
with regard to this bill , the House did give unanimous consent earlier to exceptionally deal with this legislation , to pass it at report and third reading stages today .
therefore the House has already expressed its desire to see this legislation proceed .
the Chair very clearly states that this is not and will not be considered as a precedent .
the concerns of the hon. whip of the official opposition are noted .
accordingly , is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
carried .
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea .
some hon. members :
yea .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
all those opposed will please say nay .
an hon. member :
nay .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
in my opinion -
hon. Don Boudria :
Mr. Speaker , it is important for the House to know whether you are seeking consent to put the motion on whether to revert to the previous clause or whether you are adopting Motion No. 2 itself .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
that is a very wise clarification .
it is to revert to the motion as put by the whip .
is there unanimous consent ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
so that we are absolutely clear , we are now dealing with Motion No. 2 .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
some hon. members :
No.
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Chair is not certain what the Chair heard , so the Chair will repeat the request .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
some hon. members :
No.
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea .
some hon. members :
yea .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
all those opposed will please say nay .
some hon. members :
nay .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
in my opinion the nays have it .
an hon. member :
on division .
( motion No. 2 negatived )
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
i declare the motion defeated on division .
i therefore declare Motions Nos. 4 and 6 defeated .
debate is on Motion No. 3 .
resuming debate , the hon. member for Berthier - Montcalm .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will be very brief .
i will deal with Motions Nos. 3 and 5 , and I do realize that they have been separated .
you separated Motion No. 3 from Motion No. 5 , with unanimous consent .
there will be a separate vote on these motions .
motions Nos. 3 and 5 are similar , but Motion No. 3 deals with the warrant for arrest .
so it is not necessary to give all those details .
we will vote against Motion No. 3 .
as for Motion No. 5 , and I will speak to it now so that I will not have to rise later , on the warrant to enter a dwelling - house , we agree with this and we will vote for this amendment because in this case , this is useful and it gives police officers more powers to obtain a warrant to enter a dwelling - house without necessarily knowing the name of the individual who is there , as long as they have a description .
for example , he is tall , he is dressed in a blue suit , he has brown hair , he has brown eyes , he belongs to the Bloc perhaps .
in this way we have more information and we can enter a dwelling - house without necessarily having the name of the individual , his date of birth and other similar information .
therefore , for these reasons , we will vote against Motion No. 3 but we will vote for Motion No. 5 .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the question is on Motion No. 3 .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
some hon. members :
No.
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea .
some hon. members :
yea .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
all those opposed will please say nay .
some hon. members :
nay .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
in my opinion the nays have it .
an hon. member :
on division .
( motion No. 3 negatived )
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
i declare the motion defeated on division .
resuming debate on Motion No. 5 .
Mr. Ken Epp :
Mr. Speaker , on a point of order .
please correct me if I am wrong but I believe that the rules of the debate were that the vote on Motion No. 3 was to apply to Motion No. 5 , unless that has been rescinded while I was not paying attention .
an hon. member :
it was .
Mr. Ken Epp :
it was ?
thank you .
i withdraw my question .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise again with respect to this amendment as it pertains to a revision or an adaptation to an amendment contained in Bill C - 16 .
this refers specifically to form 7.1 as it exists currently in the Criminal Code .
the amendment is aimed specifically at allowing a police officer in the form of the warrant to include a description as it pertains to a person the police are seeking .
the police could therefore go to the dwelling house named in the warrant and make proper arrest .
there is still judicial discretion .
the justice of the peace will always have the discretion to refuse the police if that description is unnecessary .
so there are sufficient safeguards in place .
i do not want to speak at length .
the proposed amendment is very straightforward .
Mr. Speaker , I believe you will unanimous consent with respect to this amendment .
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to put on the record , as was stated earlier , that we do support this amendment .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the question is on Motion No. 5 .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Chair , not hearing any nays , declares the motion carried .
( motion No. 5 agreed to )
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( for the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada ) moved that the bill , as amended , be concurred in .
( motion agreed to )
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
when shall the bill be read the third time ?
by leave , now ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
an hon. member :
on division .
( motion agreed to , bill read the third time and passed )
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
debate .
Mr. Bob Kilger :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of clarification .
are we presently engaging in debate on third reading ?
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
this bill may not go down in the annals of history as one to be used as a case history on how to handle a bill .
it may , as a matter of fact , go down in history as how not to handle a bill .
i believe , with unanimous consent , if anybody wishes to revert to the bill it is possible , but the bill has been carried at third reading .
Mr. Bob Kilger :
i think we should begin by seeing consent to see the clock as being 1.30 p.m.
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay :
Mr. Speaker , we just want to make sure that we were voting on the motion for third reading .
some hon. members :
Yes.
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay :
we were .
very well .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is there unanimous consent to see the clock as 1.30 p.m. so we may proceed with Private Members ' Business ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
it being l .30 p.m. , the House will now proceed to the consideration of Private Members ' Business as listed on today ' s Order Paper .
private MEMBERS ' BUSINESS
distinct SOCIETY
that , in the opinion of this House , the government should support equality among the provinces and Canadians in general by ensuring that no province be recognized as a distinct society within the Constitution of Canada .
in light of the recent Calgary declaration the merit of the motion should be self - evident to all Canadians .
given the desire of traditional parties to cling to the concept of distinct society , I am under no illusions about the criticism they will offer today .
to start , there will be those who will criticize the initiative before us as being anti - Quebec .
to those who feel this way I respond in advance that like the Calgary declaration the motion is not anti - anything .
it is in essence pro Canadian .
it is crafted with the desire to create a new Canada where everyone is proud to be a Canadian .
i say this with a great deal of confidence .
the motion before us is pro Canadian in the sense that it recognizes a fundamental principle held in the hearts of all Canadians , namely that we are all equal .
the motion before us is about advancing the principle of equality among all Canadians and entrenching the paramount importance of individual rights .
the protection of individual rights is also significant .
one of the major faults in the Meech and Charlottetown accords was that they sought to constitutionally entrench a collective right .
in doing so , there would have existed within the Canadian constitution the potential that individual rights could be made subservient to the collective right of a distinct society .
this argument was based on the widely held and correct perception among Canadians that recognition of Quebec as a distinct society would confer some collective right on the peoples of that province not conferred on the others .
therein lay the problem and the dilemma faced by constitutional framers and politicians , the same people who tried on numerous occasions to ram distinct society through with little or no regard for the real feelings of Canadians .
what was the response from the traditional party leaders at the federal and provincial levels ?
they resorted to labelling anyone who opposed the distinct society initiative as unpatriotic .
they also played on the fears of Canadians by saying that the country would fall apart without such an amendment to the constitution .
the country is still here .
worse still , there was a deliberate attempt to mislead Canadians about what distinct society really meant .
at the time we had the former prime minister of the last place party telling Canadians outside Quebec that distinct society was nothing more than a symbolic recognition of that province ' s place in Confederation .
i want to briefly touch on that symbolic recognition .
this is what distinguishes the Calgary declaration from Meech and Charlottetown .
that was the problem with Meech and Charlottetown .
both initiatives tried to craft this historical recognition into a constitutional power afforded only to Quebec .
all the while and within Quebec the former prime minister and the late Premier Bourassa were saying just that .
to hear them tell it , the clause would be used to enhance that province ' s powers within federation .
the federal doublespeak and actions on distinct society would be quite funny if they were not so terribly sad for the future of the country .
i also want to deal with what I see is the potential harm in the collective right of distinct society ever becoming entrenched .
granted this will be speculative because thankfully the clause is not in the Constitution .
that has more to do with the wisdom of Canadians than it does the foresight of traditional politicians who even now think entrenchment of distinct society will solve the unity problem .
in any event , the arguments concerning the potential harm of entrenching distinct society are speculative but they are not without a historical precedent to back them up .
i want to briefly discuss the precedent .
the lessons and arguments in that instance will serve to highlight what I feel are the pitfalls where distinct society is concerned .
patriation of the Canadian Constitution was achieved to some degree because the federal government was able to secure an agreement with nine of the ten provinces .
the federal government had acted unilaterally but the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that some provincial support was needed .
this clause was part of the price the federal government had to pay for getting an agreement on the Constitution .
the rationale behind the notwithstanding clause was to place some kind of a constitutional check on the powers of the federal government .
at the time some premiers believed this was needed to in part prevent legislation or new spending initiatives which might cross into areas of provincial jurisdiction .
it was also believed that this clause would help in securing Quebec ' s signature on the Constitution .
aside from the rationale and intentions behind the notwithstanding clause , good , bad or otherwise , there were those who saw the potential danger in having a constitution which could allow a province to disregard federal legislation or a ruling by the supreme court concerning the constitutionality of a provincial law .
this potential danger is significant because the arguments used to downplay the consequences at that time are the same ones used now with respect to distinct society .
in this regard it is no small wonder then that Canadians feel successive governments have learned nothing from past constitutional experiences .
they have little or no faith in the sincerity of politicians to do what is best or in their ability to deal with the national unity problem .
this is truly tragic .
and as someone whose name escapes me at the moment once said , " Those who do not learn from the mistakes of the past are destined to repeat them . "
what were those dire consequences that some predicted would befall the notwithstanding clause ?
Canadians with enough foresight saw that a province might use the clause to override the charter of rights and that in so doing , the rights of individuals in that province could be damaged .
that is exactly what did happen .
but we need not concern ourselves with the circumstances under which the use of that clause came about .
we will visit that in due course .
what is now relevant were the arguments used at that time to allay fears that the notwithstanding clause would ever be used by any province .
i think we remember them well .
they are hauntingly familiar to those used by former and present governments seeking to mollify Canadians about the constitutional impact of the distinct society provision .
as I said , in response to a well - founded fear that some province might use the notwithstanding clause , the government of the day sought to minimize the chance of this ever happening .
the political media and to a lesser extent , the academic elites , said " Oh , this will never happen .
no province would ever use the notwithstanding clause .
the political price of using it would be too great for any province .
the court of public opinion in that province would stop a government from invoking the clause " and on and on it went .
basically , the predictions were ignored and political leaders felt secure in their belief that the override provision would never , ever be used .
but of course they were wrong .
let us fast forward from 1982 to 1989 when the Government of Quebec invoked the notwithstanding clause .
the province did this in response to a Supreme Court of Canada ruling which found Quebec ' s language law , bill 178 , to be unconstitutional and violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
i am not so much interested in why the notwithstanding clause was used .
it is far more revealing to delve into parallels between the potential dangers it posed and those which by extension are inherent in the distinct society clause .
the politicians of the day had not been completely wrong about the effect of public opinion surrounding Quebec ' s use of the notwithstanding clause .
the problem was that the court of public opinion did not change a thing and its full impact reaction was well after the fact .
still , some negative fallout was incurred by the Quebec government on the issue .
for as constitutional as their use of the notwithstanding clause had been , it did not sit well with people inside and outside of Quebec who expressed concern that the provincial government had effectively trampled on the rights of English speaking Quebeckers .
what was needed then was an amendment to the Canadian Constitution , one that would allow Quebec to side step the charter of rights in matters such as language and not put the province in the awkward position of having to use the notwithstanding clause in order to do it .
in short , the Canadian Constitution would have to be interpreted in such a way as to recognize the province ' s rights to make such laws .
from the very beginning of that notion is born the idea of distinct society , in effect , an amendment which would allow Quebec to override the Constitution by giving it the power to take whatever steps were necessary to preserve and promote Quebec as a distinct society .
let us now examine the predictions and the potential dangers of how a distinct society clause might truly impact on the Constitution .
indeed , the alarm bells that went unheeded with respect to the notwithstanding clause are the same ones ringing again over distinct society today .
if , as governments in Quebec have demanded , the Canadian Constitution and charter of rights must be interpreted in a fashion that recognizes Quebec as a distinct society , what happens in a situation where individual rights , such as freedom of expression , conflict with this collective right based on culture and language ?
actually the question is rhetorical because we all know the answer .
it is just that there are those who are loathe to admit it , or refuse to accept it , or do not want the rest of the country to really understand it .
using the situation surrounding the supreme court ' s consideration of Quebec ' s bill 178 , a distinct society clause would have allowed the supreme court to come back and say bill 178 was constitutional .
that is right .
no messy or unpalatable use of a notwithstanding clause .
no federal government interference because the federal government would say that it cannot do a thing , the supreme court has ruled and that decision must be respected .
this sounds familiar .
at least then voters will not be able to blame government for the consequences of its inactions .
in order that all MPs will be given a say in this matter , I ask for the unanimous consent of members present to make this motion votable .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
does the member for Nanaimo - Cowichan have unanimous consent to have this motion made votable .
some hon. members :
No.
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
unanimous consent is denied .
Mr. Paul DeVillers ( Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to respond on behalf of the government to the motion tabled by the hon. member for Nanaimo - Cowichan .
this motion highlights the differing viewpoints between the government and the hon. member with respect to national unity .
as was clearly indicated in the Speech from the Throne , the government has made this issue its top priority for its current mandate .
we want to proceed with national reconciliation .
we believe the Calgary declaration is an important step in that direction .
the nine premiers would not support the spirit of the hon. member ' s motion either .
even though the results of the consultations they will be holding with their respective populations are not yet in , it already appears that the majority of Canadians support the major principles of the Calgary declaration .
the first part of the motion the member is asking us to consider concerns equality among provinces and Canadians in general .
i would reassure my colleague that equality is a principle shared by all Canadians and supported fully by the our government .
the first two clauses of the Calgary declaration are devoted to it .
the principle of equality is at the heart of our identity .
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms clearly recognizes it in section 15 , which guarantees equality of Canadians before the law .
in this regard , clause 1 of the Calgary declaration provides that all Canadians are equal and that their rights are protected by law .
we are also in agreement with respect to the equality status of the provinces .
there are not two or three types of status for provinces .
in the Canadian federation , provinces have equal status .
all provinces can exercise the same powers .
nevertheless some provinces may show more of a desire than others to exercise some of these powers .
in fact , over the years , some provinces have used certain powers while others have chosen not to do so .
for example , all provinces have the power to administer the collection of individual income tax , but only Quebec does so and has the necessary personnel and infrastructure .
in 1965 all provinces had the right to opt out of certain national established programs and receive appropriate compensation , including tax points .
only Quebec chose to do so , which is why the federal tax rate is lower in Quebec than in the other provinces .
only Quebec has exercised its constitutional right to set up its own pension plan .
the other provinces are covered by the Canada pension plan .
those powers that Quebec has exercised have always been available to the other provinces .
that the Government of Quebec has exercised them while others have chosen not to does not confer special status on the province .
that is why clause 6 of the Calgary declaration stipulates that if any future constitutional amendment confers powers on one province , those powers would have to be available to all provinces .
thus equality does not mean uniformity , nor does equality of treatment mean uniformity of treatment .
let us consider an example that concerns the province of the hon. member for Nanaimo - Cowichan .
when the government works with the Government of British Columbia to support Pacific salmon fishers , that does not give the province an additional right in comparison with other provinces .
rather , it means that only British Columbia has a Pacific salmon fishery .
neither case involves special privileges , but rather different contexts .
governments must recognize that all provinces and all citizens are equal , but must also respond to a variety of needs and circumstances .
i would even add that each province can occupy all of its space within the federation in its full specificity and Canada is the richer for it .
equalization is another example .
under that program the federal government makes payments to some provinces but not to others .
that does not mean that inequalities are being created among the provinces .
rather it means that all citizens have access to comparable services , no matter what region they live in .
the essential difference between our party ' s view and my colleague ' s motion is that for him equality seems to mean uniformity , whereas we believe that these two concepts do not necessarily mean the same thing .
to impose uniformity of treatment in a country such as ours is to deny one of its greatest treasures , its diversity .
that will never be the policy of the Liberal Party of Canada .
my colleague maintains that recognizing the specificity of a province in the Constitution would run counter to the principle of equality of provinces and citizens .
as I have already stated , we all agree with the principle of equality among citizens and provinces .
the government , however , rejects the one size fits all approach .
that is why we support recognizing the unique character of Quebec as proposed in the declaration of the nine premiers .
the Calgary declaration defines the unique character of Quebec society in terms of its French speaking majority , its culture and its tradition of civil law .
that definition reminds us that Quebec is different from the other provinces in many ways , one characteristic being that it contains within its territory the only French speaking majority on the North American continent .
i would remind my colleague that although the expression " unique character " has only recently entered the political vocabulary , all of our constitutional laws have contained implicit recognition of the distinct character of Quebec ' s identity from the Quebec Act of 1774 to the Constitution Act of 1982 , including the Constitutional Act of 1791 and the Constitution Act of 1867 .
in fact the Constitution Act of 1867 recognized Quebec ' s special legal system and even then contained provisions regarding bilingualism and the appointment of supreme court justices .
i would add that the constitutional recognition of the unique character of Quebec would merely formalize an existing practice in the courts , an opinion that is shared by the former chief justice of the supreme court , the Right Hon. Brian Dickson .
the unique character of Quebec society is an obvious observation which is taken into account in current practice .
so how would recognizing it jeopardize the equality of citizens and provinces ?
simply put , in no way .
the Calgary declaration is not a constitutional amendment .
it is a statement of principles .
however if recognition of the unique character of Quebec society were to be entrenched in the Constitution , that recognition would be framed as an interpretive clause like the current section 27 of the charter of rights which recognizes the multicultural character of Canada ' s heritage .
fifteen years after the charter was adopted , can any Canadian say that his or her rights have been threatened by that clause ?
in addition to honouring the universal principle of equality , such recognition will serve the unity of the country well .
as I have already said , our government made national unity its top priority in this term of office .
and whatever helps the cause will receive our support .
this is why we support the Calgary declaration .
we recognize that it is a positive step by proposing a framework for discussions that reflect Canadian realities and values .
i would like to finish with a quote that Canadians believe , as Alberta ' s premier Ralph Klein has said , in a Canada where all provinces have equal status , but a Canada that allows Quebec to protect those things that make it such a unique part of our national character , a tolerant and diverse nation where we are all equal as Canadians no matter where we live but where the word equality is not used as a blanket to smother diversity .
i believe that is what Canadians believe .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is unfortunate to see such misunderstanding of Quebec and a constant , and thinly veiled , attack on the Quebec people by English Canada .
this is an extremely important subject for us in Quebec and I would need far more than ten minutes to explain our point of view concerning it .
i will , however , make an attempt to explain it to you , and to convince the hon. members of this Parliament , solely on historical grounds , briefly of course .
solely on historical grounds , I trust that they will understand that provincial equality , as seen by the hon. Reform member , and even by the government members , does not in any way correspond to the historical demands of the Quebec people .
speaking of history , I believe we cannot help but conclude that the creation of Canada was based on a historic misunderstanding .
in 1867 , when Lower Canada and Upper Canada decided to unite , it was common knowledge that francophones were a minority everywhere in North America with the exception of Lower Canada .
the people of Lower Canada had agreed to a federal system knowing that this would at least give them the power and democratic control of a member state within the federation .
as for Upper Canada , what it wanted was a very strong Canada , a unitary regime .
the signing did take place , however .
the Fathers of Confederation did sign an agreement , believing one thing , but the facts prove that they reached a devious agreement to get around the system they had used to sell Lower Canada on signing .
the area of jurisdiction found under section 92 of the Canadian Constitution is being nibbled away at .
little by little , in an indirect by nevertheless real way , through Supreme Court judgments - and the list is long - the federal government is taking powers away from Quebec .
the most recent example , hot off the press so to speak , is Bill C - 14 on water management .
if there is one area that comes under Quebec jurisdiction this is it .
if there is one thing that is dear to the hearts of Quebeckers it is water .
the federal government in its wisdom figured it should interfere in that area in the name of peace , order and good government or using the rule of federal precedence .
as far as the Constitution is concerned , the Quiet Revolution stirred Quebec to go from passively defending vested powers to actively claiming new powers .
this is nothing new .
since the 1960 s , successive Quebec premiers have constantly been asking that Quebec be given more powers .
why ?
because they found it necessary for the political , social , economic and cultural development of Quebec society .
since 1982 , we have had premiers in Quebec who were federalists and even Liberals .
in 1982 , for the first time since 1867 , the Constitution was amended without Quebec ' s consent .
that was the end of an old dream of Quebeckers , who had viewed the federation as a pact between two founding nations , which could therefore only be changed with their mutual consent .
what Motion M - 26 shows is that the concept of distinct society has lost a lot of ground in a very short time .
a previous speaker mentioned the Meech Lake and Charlottetown agreements and the Calgary declaration .
closer scrutiny invariably reveals that every time there is an agreement in English Canada , Quebec ends up not with more but with fewer powers .
in the Meech Lake Accord , the Bourassa government , a federalist government I might add , set out the five conditions to be met before Quebec could approve the Constitution Act of 1982 .
what were the five conditions ?
first , recognizing Quebec as a distinct society , which would be meaningful and would be used by the courts as an interpretation formula to grant more powers when considering Quebec ' s traditional demands .
second , guaranteeing a more prominent role regarding immigration .
third , allowing Quebec to participate in the appointment of supreme court justices .
fourth , limiting the federal government ' s spending power .
it is through this power that , increasingly , the federal government has been taking over powers that belong to Quebec , powers that are recognized as ours under section 92 of the Constitution .
with its spending power , Ottawa is putting money in areas that are not under federal jurisdiction .
fifth , recognizing Quebec ' s veto on the reform of federal institutions and the creation of new provinces .
these were the five conditions seen as a minimum by a federalist Quebec premier , Robert Bourassa .
we know what happened to the Meech Lake accord .
English Canada felt Quebec was getting way too much .
following this episode and some arm - twisting , the Charlottetown accord was struck .
what happened then to the notion of distinct society , which was the minimum for Quebec to join the Canadian confederation ?
they tried to dilute it even further , with a sort of Canada clause in which everyone was equal , in which the principle of equality of all the provinces appeared for the first time in an accord concluded with English Canada .
what became of the Charlottetown accord ?
it was defeated .
it was defeated in the west because it gave too much power to Quebec , and it was defeated in Quebec because it gave too little power to Quebec .
then there was the Calgary accord .
the focus shifted to unique character .
distinct society was no longer of interest .
and here we saw a premier who was at least honest , the premier of Ontario , who said that unique character was meaningless because everything in Canada was unique , from Pacific salmon to the tar sands of Alberta .
it was all unique .
in addition , as if that were not enough , points 2 to 6 of the Calgary declaration set out clearly the equality of the provinces .
never will a premier of Quebec , whether it be Maurice Duplessis , Lesage , Johnson , Sauv 茅 , Bertrand , Barrette , Bourassa , Parizeau , the last Johnson , Daniel , or the present incumbent , Lucien Bouchard , allow Quebec to be put on an equal footing with all the other provinces because we are one of the two founding peoples .
this historic fact must be recognized .
there must be recognition of the fact that Quebec forms a people .
no , no and no .
Mr. Andr 茅 Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wish to congratulate the citizens of my region for having chosen to send me to represent them here in the Canadian Parliament .
i come from a proud region that has always asserted its nationalism .
it is a region where nationalism has also developed in a rather sustained manner because we have always had to fight to be recognized by both the major levels of government , the one in Quebec and the one in Ottawa .
on every issue , whether it be large infrastructures , social matters or regional development plans , I can tell you that great effort is always necessary to be recognized and to be able to have a fair share of the benefits to which we are entitled .
as for the resolution by my colleague from the Reform Party , I know that it is an issue where it is quite easy to slip into inflated rhetoric .
i will try to avoid this , knowing that you are a member of that party , although I think that you are capable of showing understanding and objectivity in an issue that is of interest in fact to the whole country and that can at some point involve the security of the population .
speaking of the Reform Party , I must admit that the perception I had from the exterior when that party was first created was that it was perfect in all areas , from social issues to fiscal matters .
gradually , however , I realized that this is not exactly the case .
when moving a party leader into a house costs the population $ 115,000 , I must say that since these figures were published in the public accounts , in my region and through all my colleagues , I can assure you that the party has lost a lot of credibility in its consideration of both fiscal matters and constitutional matters .
we also remember its campaign , especially during the last two weeks when conciliatory advances were made to us after we had been excluded as Quebeckers during two full weeks , after the door had been shut completely on us as partners who are acceptable , who can make a rather comprehensive contribution to the future of our country .
in short , I think the Reform Party has a long hill to climb to return to its pristine state of old .
they are realizing that as they wear out it is hard to put forward proposals for national reconciliation .
this seems blatantly obvious to me .
let us take a normal family , an ordinary family .
clearly we are all equal , but we are not all identical .
what is true for a family is true for a country like ours .
certain collective rights must be defended .
we are not asking for privileges .
i was listening to my colleague from the government .
the problem in this case is that grandstanding is so easy that irresponsible politicians in this country have succeeded in spoiling the social climate .
Mr. Speaker , you are a reasonable man .
do you remember the Meech Lake accord in 1990 ?
our government was in power and Mr. Mulroney was the Prime Minister .
god knows he cannot be blamed for working toward reconciliation .
at that time , 90 % of Canadians were in favour of the accord .
what was the result of interventions by certain former Liberal prime ministers and premiers , Clyde Wells and two or three others ?
a deterioration in our social climate , and a party like the Reform accentuates that negativity .
what has led to the degeneration of our social climate in this country is the irresponsibility of certain politicians and certain political parties ; instead of working constructively , working in the best interest of all Canadians and the best interest of all Quebecers , they have preferred to stoop to partisan politics .
i believe this is the situation in which we find ourselves at the moment .
it is such a bad situation that , should a committee be struck , I am not sure politicians should sit on it .
like everyone else in this House , I talk to ordinary people who must work every day to earn a living .
i think these people , who are people like us outside the House of Commons , would very quickly find a solution .
what divides and separates us is very minor .
a solution could be found very quickly .
unfortunately , when politicians decide to deal with this issue , they do so for partisan motives and I am convinced this is the problem in the constitutional debate .
yesterday , I talked to people from the education community .
i ask Reformers to adopt a more comprehensive view of things .
our fellow citizens are asking politicians across the country to cool down and deal with real problems by using the right words .
the worst enemies of the kind of partnership everyone wants are the extremists .
the people in my riding in Quebec and elsewhere come to us with real issues , economic issues , social issues ; they talk about roads .
they want their politicians to improve their quality of live in a real , concrete way , without arguing endlessly about minor details .
it is not true that , as I heard someone say earlier , Quebeckers believe all Canadians are against them .
it is not true that Manitoba farmers wake up at night thinking about their counterparts in Lac - Saint - Jean because they hate them so much .
i do not believe that .
this is a highly emotional debate fuelled by irresponsible politicians with regional interests .
this is the great challenge facing Canada .
i repeat , if a committee were formed to help us , as Canadians , get back on track , I wonder whether members of Parliament would be the best candidates .
it has been my pleasure , on this Friday afternoon , to make my humble contribution to this debate about an issue of concern to the whole country .
Ms. Paddy Torsney ( Burlington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak today to private members Motion No. 26 .
it is important to recognize that the province of Quebec occupies a unique place in Canada and that all Canadians should reach out , whether they be Quebeckers or other Canadians , to preserve our wonderful country .
when we line up all the reasons for keeping our country united , we can manage without difficulty to celebrate and recognize Quebec , the only majority French speaking society in North America , as a fundamental characteristic in Canada .
we can manage to say as did the Manitoba constitutional task force in 1991 :
it is time to reach out formally to the people of Quebec and recognize in the Constitution their special identity which has contributed so significantly to the building of Canada .
all democracies make constitutional changes from time to time .
usually they do so by proceeding one step at a time , one issue at a time .
it is obvious that Canada deserves to survive and can be improved even without constitutional change .
at the same time a better affirmed recognition of Quebec in our Constitution would be a good thing in and of itself , a remarkable expression of Canadian values .
let us do a little what if experiment together .
what if the people of Saskatchewan were in the situation that Quebeckers are in today ?
what if they lived in the only anglophone province surrounded by nine francophone provinces in Canada and French was the language of the United States , the international language of economics , finance , science , the Internet , movies , the latest pop music , and the language of immigrants from Asia or elsewhere ?
why then would they not ask their fellow citizens in the other provinces to recognize this special situation they have found themselves in ?
we might not call it distinct society but then again we just might .
this desire to affirm cultural and regional identities is seen around the world .
i am proud to come from Ontario .
we need to find a way to express the obvious link between constitutional recognition of Quebec and the great Canadian value of respect for diversity .
we could easily harmonize that recognition with our ideal of the equality of citizens which the Canadian charter legally entrenches .
we can harmonize it easily with the equality of status of the provinces .
equality of status must not be confused with uniform treatment .
as members of the House can easily understand an example , parents love their children equally and give them the same attention , but they treat each child according to his or individual needs .
it is the ability to combine equality and diversity that has so contributed to the country ' s success and reputation in the world .
it is precisely in that perspective that we should recognize the place of our only majority francophone province within Canada .
in so doing , we would for all practical purposes merely be formalizing a principle already admitted by our courts , a principle that leads them to take account of the context of each province in order to make just decisions , including the specific context of Quebec .
it is the eminent Saskatchewanian , former Supreme Court Chief Justice Brian Dickson , who said :
as a practical matter entrenching formal recognition of Quebec ' s distinctive character in the Constitution would not involve a significant departure from the existing practice of our courts .
when the premiers of the nine provinces and the territorial leaders next meet , I hope they will continue down that road started in St. Andrews and continued in Calgary .
yes , we are ready to engage in a positive way to secure the future of Canada .
yes , our Canada will include Quebec for ourselves and for future generations , an authentic Quebec that is part of Canada , that is part of all of us .
as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has demonstrated time and again , if it is explained that we can reconcile the diversity of Canada including Quebec ' s uniqueness with the principles of equality of citizens and the equal status of provinces , support for recognizing Quebec is even higher .
let us look at the popular support for the principles of the Calgary declaration .
an Angus Reid poll shows that 73 % of Canadians , including no less than 70 % of British Columbians , think the premiers national unity initiative is a positive step in the right direction .
a new Environics poll shows that around 70 % of Canadians , including interestingly enough 68 % of British Columbians and 68 % of Quebeckers , support recognizing the unique character of Quebec in the Constitution as long as any advantage this may give to Quebec is made available to the other provinces .
because Canadians judge that the principle of equality and diversity is good in and of itself they support the Calgary declaration .
it is in this spirit that I urge citizens to participate in the consultation process that the provincial premiers have launched to discuss the Calgary declaration .
this is an initiative that will help keep Canada together so that as Quebeckers , as British Columbians and as Ontarian residents we can all continue to share in this marvellous country .
i hope I have demonstrated that the recognition of the specificity of Quebec does not imply a special status for that province and that it is in the interest of all Canadians that this show of good will be realized .
further , I remind all hon. members that Canada is currently undergoing an intense period of social and political change .
we have not become a tolerant country by accident .
our country has an enviable reputation in that regard because since the beginning of our history anglophones and francophones have been called on to journey together .
that spirit of openness has allowed Canadians to welcome to our country new citizens from all corners of the international community , including my family .
our diversity is a strength and a defining characteristic of our country .
we all know that Canada is a remarkable human success .
we all must work hard each and every day to keep it united .
every one of us can play a role in that regard .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
if the hon. member would like to have the floor , it is the hon. member ' s privilege .
Mr. Gar Knutson ( Elgin - Middlesex - London , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is with honour that I speak for the first time in the 36 th Parliament .
as with my first speech in the 35 th Parliament , I want to take this opportunity , in my second maiden speech , to thank the constituents of Elgin - Middlesex - London for electing me in June of 1997 .
it was a great honour to be re - elected .
being elected the first time was a tremendous honour , but to have it reaffirmed is certainly one of the greatest moments in my life .
let me now turn to the issue at hand , Quebec and its uniqueness .
people need to understand that at a very fundamental level they feel threatened by living in what they see as an anglophone Canada , an anglophone North America and , in may respects , with the age of Internet , mass communications and satellites , what may turn into an anglophone world .
what they want is some recognition in the rest of the country of their Frenchness .
they want some understanding that they can have a minimum of protection in the Constitution .
in certain respects it is an emotional thing , but they feel that their culture , their heritage and particularly their language are under great threat .
i explained this to people in St. Thomas .
when we see a Pizza Hut open up or a Blockbuster video on the main street of St. Thomas it is not a cultural issue .
when my children play on the Internet , that is not a cultural issue .
if I go to an American movie , again , it is not a cultural issue .
if I am bombarded with Much Music on television when my kids are watching it , it is not a big issue for me as an English - speaking person .
it is at that level that they feel they need some protection .
if we go to a French community today we may find no one who speaks English or very few who speak English .
they actually believe that 30 , 40 or 50 years down the road their children and their grandchildren , because of all these outside pressures , will be speaking English .
when we start to understand the issue at that emotional level , I think we can understand what they are after .
they are after recognition , which the Calgary declaration does an adequate job of providing .
it recognizes Quebec as being unique .
we can debate whether we should use the word distinct , unique or some other word .
for me , it is really about semantics .
it really does not matter .
the main point is that the majority of Quebeckers are French speaking and they want to protect their culture .
once they get the recognition , they also want to have a veto over changes to the Constitution .
that will basically give them the two anchors of any constitutional change .
they need recognition and they also need a regional veto .
if we open our minds to this we can see the possibility as can people in my own community of Elgin .
he could care less about a Hungarian club that might be in Simcoe or some other place , or a Croatian club just outside St. Thomas .
it matters not to him that the people in Quebec want to speak French .
he says that is a perfectly legitimate thing .
i explained to him that it will not affect his right for anything , that it will not make him any less equal , that it is really about people protecting their language and their culture .
at its most fundamental level this is respect for the ways of their parents and grandparents , for the traditions that have been passed down .
it is respect for the traditions they have grown up with and a desire to see those traditions passed on to their children and their grandchildren .
we can all understand that .
we are proud of our heritage .
we are proud of what our ancestors did regardless of our ethnic backgrounds .
in Quebec they feel particularly threatened and they want to see it protected .
i think we should support that .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the time for Private Members ' Business is at its end .
i would seek the unanimous consent of the House to allow the mover of the motion , the hon. member for Nanaimo - Cowichan , two minutes to wrap up .
is there unanimous consent for the hon. member for Nanaimo - Cowichan to have two minutes ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to see that my motion has produced such a good debate .
i hope through it all we have learned much about each other ' s opinions , our differences and our similarities .
surely that is what part of this was all about .
however the hon. member should realize that many other Canadians see the use of a phrase like distinct society as the way for a particular majority in any province to have its way over a minority .
i would not tolerate that kind of situation in my own province of British Columbia let alone in the province of Quebec or in any other province of Canada .
equality certainly does not mean uniformity .
no one in his right mind would think that .
we in this country are a very diverse people .
if we are going to get along in this nation we must not use phrases which for many people are seen as giving anyone or any group special status over anybody else .
a nation cannot survive as a bunch of separate and distinct societies .
it will never weave the kind of fabric that is needed to keep the blanket of the country together .
sooner or later it will unravel and there will be no country at all .
Je suis Canadien .
i was born a Canadian , I will die a Canadian .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the time provided for the consideration of Private Members ' Business has now expired and the order is dropped from the Order Paper .
it being 1.54 p.m. , the House stands adjourned until Monday , November 17 , 1997 at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Orders 28 ( 2 ) and 24 ( 1 ) .
( the House adjourned at 1.54 p.m. )

private MEMBERS ' BUSINESS
income TAX ACT
madam Speaker , it is a real pleasure to rise in the House today to address my private members ' bill , C - 223 .
this bill will be supported by a lot of industries right across Canada .
i have had contacts from the housing industry and the banking industry , saying that this bill or this type of Income Tax Act change is long overdue .
we want a good solid family , a family that has some encouragement and desire to put equity into a home or shelter .
we often forget that these young families will be dealing with a taxation burden never before been seen in Canadian history .
look at the $ 600 billion of debt which is going to be put on their shoulders in the next century , a debt which they will have to service .
the way the government has been going the last three and a half or four years will add another $ 100 billion to that .
we know we have to do something for these young families so that they will have an incentive to continue to pay taxes .
otherwise I think they will feel like giving up and saying " why should I even try to get equity because it is all going to be taxed away from me before I have the interest or the ability to own a home '' .
i designed this bill so that it would not be an incentive for home owners to upgrade their dwelling or be favourable to the higher income families .
i felt it should address the lower income families , the people who have really been behind the eight ball , giving them a level playing field when it comes to home ownership .
if we look back through history , no matter what happened in the thirties , the twenties and the fifties , home ownership was always something that set the tone for the economy of that decade .
when people could afford to buy homes , we had a stronger economy .
a year or two ago home ownership picked up .
when I did some research it astounded me that in 1993 there were 350,000 exchanges of home ownership .
they were either people who were upgrading to better homes or people who could afford new homes .
out of that 350,000 changes in home ownership 50,000 were new homes .
when we turn that into dollars and cents , it is quite amazing what that does to an economy with 50,000 new homes , plus the furnishings that are put into them , plus the landscaping and whatever that goes with a new home which provides a lot of jobs .
that is what this country needs : jobs and the ability to afford to own a home .
this bill also gives these new home owners an incentive to apply their equity which can be used in their retirement .
that is another benefit in this bill .
it will give people the opportunity to acquire equity that they can in their senior years use as a retirement fund .
for people who have been buying homes lately , who took the gamble because they thought the economy was turning up , I have proposed that this bill , if passed , will be applicable to first time home owners who bought their homes after December 31 , 1994 . Therefore , there is the opportunity for people who took the chance and went out on a limb because they were allowed to use 5 % of their RRSPs to invest in a home , to secure their investment by being able to deduct the interest from the time that the bill is passed .
there was a complaint from a number of people who asked why first time home owners should get this tax break when people who rent out their units do not get a tax break .
i was astounded when I researched the Income Tax Act to see what kind of tax breaks rental owners do get .
they can include the insurance on their rental property , maintenance and repairs , heat , light and water , advertising , interest on the money borrowed , as I am proposing in this bill for first time home owners .
we can see that it is really not a level playing field for the home owners at this time .
people who have rental units can even include automobile expenses that they use for servicing the property , advertizing and commissions paid to obtain tenants .
all these things are tax deductible .
we are about 50 years behind in our income tax compared to the U.S. There are certain changes in its program I would not want to have in the Income Tax Act , but the U.S. did not look at the issue of how much revenue government was losing .
it looked at the issue of how much more money was put into the economy .
i found an article written by Hugh Segal .
i do not always like what he says .
a lot of people have heard him .
we must give credit where credit is due .
i thought he made some good comments .
this is what he said :
why should the tax system encourage one activity and discourage the other ?
why is the family home a target ?
why is it less important than an office , a warehouse or a piece of machinery ?
that was the way I looked at it .
the home is a basic place of shelter , the place where we raise our families with certain moral character , where we try to teach them what is good for the country , what will be ahead of them , what they will have to do and what their responsibilities will be when they become adults .
i thought that was a pretty good argument .
in 1979 the Conservatives introduced a bill very similar to this one .
however the government of that day did not last very long , only six months , and the bill died on the order paper .
an hon. member :
that was too long anyway .
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner :
we can debate that argument when we are dealing with some other bill .
the government would probably agree with that statement so we will not get into that debate .
then he went on to say :
that is the way I have looked at it .
why should a home be taxed ?
it is fundamental if one wants to raise a family as a unit .
it is a lot better to raise a family under those conditions .
they may have the intelligence to be an entrepreneur or to develop things .
this tax break would let them either save money for some future rainy day , education purposes for their families or to start a small business .
if they had a small equity or some money they could put into a small business , that is probably the direction they would take .
it is pretty well ever family ' s desire to have a business in the home .
we know what that would do for job creation .
it is interesting to see all the benefits .
the Toronto - Dominion Bank was referred to in an article in the Winnipeg Free Press .
i even got some coverage in a paper that really does not want to give Reform too much coverage .
this is what the article said :
on a typical 25 year mortgage at 6.35 % first time home buyers could claim some $ 1,700 on their income tax , according to Diane Olivier of the Toronto - Dominion Bank .
i did not do the mathematics , but I think the bank has the ability and the research people to put those figures together .
the article continued :
" some people can be scared off by the costs of purchasing a first house " said Rischuk Park Realty owner Rusty Rischuk .
that is from another sector of the economy .
people can have confidence in a certain idea or in something that gives them an opportunity to invest .
referring to last summer when the stock market was booming and interest rates were coming down , the article said :
nearly 60 % of the city ' s homes sold from January to September were bought by first time home buyers .
we know what that does to the building trade , the furniture trade or any business tied to manufacturing these homes .
an hon. member :
it is a job creation effort .
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner :
it is job creation , very true .
in addition , it said :
a record high 25,000 Winnipeg renters could afford to purchase a home .
this was an added incentive .
it really surprised me this was an impact of the bill .
it would increase Winnipeg ' s job opportunities or the building trade by 25,000 homes .
that is quite impressive .
i hope my colleagues on both sides of the House will see the bill as something non - political that will encourage and give our young people the opportunity to invest , to have a home and to build up equity that in future years can be turned over for their retirement or for senior housing .
the bill also refers to co - op housing .
if people buy a condominium or an apartment in a co - op housing project they will be eligible under the bill as living in individual dwellings .
it will not reduce government revenue .
rather it will probably increase revenue and be positive for the economy , not negative as some people presume .
this opportunity has provided me with quite a bit of publicity in the papers .
my delight in this regard is that it shows Reform has good ideas .
if the House cannot see the light of day on that and support the bill , it will be very discouraging to keep on working .
what are we working for ?
we are trying to set up an economy for the 21 st century that will be positive , that will give our young people something to dream about , and that will tell our young people we in this generation look after them .
we will try to support them in carrying the huge tax burden because of the debt load and other mistakes made by past governments .
we did not pay attention so the problem is there .
i will just wind up in my remaining minute by saying that I am asking for the support of my colleagues in the House .
if there are some amendments that improve the bill , I will not object to them .
i hope the bill will do something for young people to encourage them to keep on building the country as did our pioneer forefathers .
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , Bill C - 223 proposes to introduce an income tax deduction with respect to the mortgage interest paid on the first $ 100,000 of a mortgage loan by individuals purchasing a first home after 1994 .
the Income Tax Act presently does not allow for the deductibility of mortgage interest on principal residences .
however , capital gains on the sale of a principal residence are not taxable to the owner either .
if mortgage interest rates were deductible , capital gains should be made taxable .
the measure , if limited to first time home buyers at maturity , would cost about $ 3 billion per year .
limiting the interest deduction to first time home buyers may be somewhat difficult .
the proposal would create some significant differences in the tax treatment of qualifying homeowners and would be quite difficult to defend .
if mortgage interest deductions were then extended to all homeowners the annual revenue cost would be approximately $ 6 billion .
admittedly , if the principal residence were subject to capital gains , the revenue decline would be somewhat less .
a taxpayer ' s choice of accommodation , owning versus renting , is a personal choice .
the hon. member attempted to make the distinction between renters and owners and provided an example of those who own rental units rather than those who live in rental units .
he is quite correct .
those who rent units do not carry on a business .
let us go back to the point that a choice of accommodation is normally a personal decision and the costs associated with it are personal expenses .
the tax system does not allow deductions and credits for personal expenses .
the proposed deduction would also be inequitable to taxpayers without a mortgage .
again it is unwarranted because capital gains in principal residences are non - taxable .
let us look at the present case .
first time home buyers already receive tax assistance under the home buyers plan .
under the plan , first time home buyers are allowed to borrow money from the RRSPs without having to include the amount as income .
this proposal would see the deductibility resulting in a net transfer to homeowners with mortgages from other taxpayers who would have either to pay higher taxes or would receive reduced services to finance the deductibility .
there would be an increase in income taxes or a reallocation from income taxes or reduced services .
furthermore , benefits would not be fairly distributed between groups of taxpayers .
benefits would be earned disproportionately by higher income earners who are more likely to have larger mortgages .
less than 15 % of the benefits under the proposal would accrue to families with less than $ 50,000 in income .
the success of the government ' s work , its deficit reduction strategy which Canadians have been quite supportive , has meant lower interest rates which have reduced the costs of home ownership .
i have respect for the hon. member , for his intent with this bill and for the hard work he put into drafting and researching it .
all members of this House are quite clearly interested in strengthening the economy , in ensuring our economy continues to grow and that our young people are able to participate .
quite frankly , the expenditure of $ 3 billion that is strictly targeted to first time home buyers or , as another hon. member mentioned , an expenditure of $ 6 billion annually across the board would result in some reallocation of services or an increase in taxes in order to maintain a balanced budget , in order to maintain the level of services Canadians expect .
an hon. member :
it ' s too simple .
Mr. Tony Valeri :
it is not too simple .
it is quite difficult to defend the legislation when one neighbour is able to deduct $ 6,000 in interest payments and because the other neighbour ' s home was purchased prior to 1994 and was not a first time purchase , that neighbour would be unable to claim that deduction .
an hon. member :
are you going to pay back all the debt you have created ?
Mr. Tony Valeri :
at this point the bill is not affordable when we are talking about $ 3 billion or $ 6 billion of expenditure .
it is not necessary from the perspective that the housing industry in this country has continued to soar over this last little while with interest rates being maintained in a certain range .
we foresee the housing industry continuing to grow .
in essence we feel the bill is unnecessary at this time .
a bigger reason is the equity of the bill .
we could not discriminate against those Canadians who because they purchased their homes prior to 1994 would be unable to deduct the interest .
if we were to extend this proposal to every homeowner it would be a $ 6 billion expenditure at a time when we have not yet balanced the budget .
yet we are starting to see these types of proposal coming forward calling for all kinds of expenditure .
as a government we are committed to ensuring we bring forward and support the fiscal policies we have brought forward over the last number of years .
we want to ensure a balanced budget .
we will ensure that any expenditure of this government is done through a reallocation .
we will ensure fairness and equity for all Canadians .
while I urge every member of this House to agree that the intent of the bill is quite laudable , I must ask every member of this House not to support the measure .
it is not affordable , necessary or equitable .
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini 猫 re , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , the bill tabled by the hon. member for Portage - Lisgar meets an urgent need to revitalize the construction sector .
it also represents an interesting way of helping future first - time home buyers by giving them a tax break on the first $ 100,000 .
interest rates are now within the reach of most people .
it is therefore appropriate that the government bring in legislation to encourage young families to buy homes more suited to their needs .
if the government were to go ahead with certain tax measures , it could thus lighten the financial burden on future homeowners .
the Reform member from Manitoba mentions that he would like to see tax deductions for future home buyers .
the Bloc Quebecois has some doubts about the Reform Party ' s intentions .
this deduction , which would be based on individual income , would help the richer members of society , and once again put the less well off at a serious disadvantage .
here again , we recognize the Reform philosophy lurking behind this bill : protect those with higher incomes and forget about the poorer members of society .
it does not surprise anyone that the Reform Party thinks along these lines , because this clearly right leaning party has frequently had its own contribution to make to the social nightmare created by the Liberals since they came to power in October 1993 .
i will , if I may , refresh my colleagues ' memory concerning the tax measures that have done great harm to our social climate : unemployment insurance reform , and cuts in provincial transfer payments that have created problems in health services , social programs and education .
what have Reformers done about these destructive Liberal policies ?
i can think of nothing .
the recent Speech from the Throne and the economic statement by the Minister of Finance show no signs of relief for the less privileged in society , and there again Reform members remain silent .
we can get an idea in fact of the Reform Party ' s social conscience when we look at their position in the current debate on the greenhouse effect throughout Canada .
the Reform Party acts as if there were only one province involved in this matter and neglects to propose a comprehensive solution to this global problem .
let us come back to the bill itself .
although its first objective is to improve the social climate , the Bloc Quebecois has serious concerns about the provisions proposed by the Reform Party to amend the Income Tax Act .
we believe these proposals will do nothing to meet the real needs of future home buyers .
in its own income tax policy , the Bloc Quebecois is very clear on the issue of tax deductions versus tax credits .
there is a difference between a tax credit and a tax deduction .
tax expenditures can take the form of tax deductions or tax credits .
tax deductions are taken into account in the calculation of the taxpayer ' s net income .
they are factored in before the amount of tax payable is determined and they therefore reduce the taxpayer ' s taxable income .
they allow him to benefit from tax savings .
these can vary according to the tax rate for that income bracket .
tax deductions are regressive , because the higher the taxable revenue , the higher the savings .
in the present system , the higher the tax rates , the greater the tax savings provided by tax deductions .
on the other hand , tax credits are subtracted from the amount of tax payable .
they are used to determine the net amount of tax payable .
tax credits are neutral .
tax savings through tax credits are the same for every taxpayer , whatever his or her taxable income .
a taxpayer with a taxable income in the $ 29,590 to $ 59,180 range would save $ 260 in taxes if he takes advantage of a tax deduction , whereas he would receive only $ 170 in the form of a tax credit for each $ 1,000 .
a taxpayer with an income in excess of $ 59,180 would save $ 290 in tax if he was entitled to a tax deduction , whereas he would receive only $ 170 in the form of a tax credit .
it can be seen , then , that federal assistance to individuals via a tax deduction can vary enormously according to the individual ' s taxable income .
a person earning less than $ 30,000 would receive $ 170 in assistance per $ 1,000 of tax deduction , while one earning $ 60,000 receives $ 290 in assistance for the same deduction .
our party therefore approves of the principle set out in Bill C - 223 , but we intend to call for a major amendment .
we would like to see the proposed tax deductions changed to tax credits , which would , in our opinion , be fairer for all those affected by this bill .
Mr. Chris Axworthy ( Saskatoon - Rosetown - Biggar , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , I am happy to rise to speak to Bill C - 223 moved by the member for Portage - Lisgar which sets out to provide mortgage interest tax reliefs to first time home buyers , up to a maximum of $ 100,000 .
it is important that we all recognize the importance of encouraging home ownership .
we know that not only a house but a home is an important part of how we provide a good start for our kids and for our families in general .
we all share in the concern and the concept that we need to do everything we can to encourage home ownership .
the question is how we go about doing this , in a fair , equitable and affordable way .
it is not surprising that the Reform Party would take an issue of some complexity and present a simplistic and unworkable solution to it .
the Reform Party constantly sees complex things as simple .
some things require more sophisticated responses than that put forward .
we need to ensure that families can find affordable and good quality homes .
the question is how to do that .
we know that over the years one of the main disincentives , especially to young families trying to afford homes , has been a high interest rate policy .
let us talk about what this bill does or perhaps what it does not do .
first , it does not recognize regional disparities across the country .
a $ 100,000 home in one part of the country may be a mansion whereas in another part of the country may not be much of a house at all .
to treat different circumstances the same way is simplistic and simply will not work .
what about the way in which the bill works ?
the Reform Party would like to suggest that this is not terribly expensive , that it will encourage growth in the home building market .
no doubt it will .
we need to cost these issues out .
as the parliamentary secretary indicated , this measure would cost $ 3 billion a year .
that is money provided then by those who do not benefit from this particular provision .
i ask why is it fair , why is it acceptable , why is it desirable to have those who cannot afford to have a home subsidize those who can .
when was that fair ?
when was that acceptable ?
it is clearly simplistic , but when was it acceptable ?
what would happen if mortgage rates increased ?
that is not beyond the realm of possibility .
then the cost would increase even further .
the point has been made that there is no horizontal equity here .
what about the person who bought a house some time before 1994 who is struggling to keep that home together and provide a good family life for their children ?
they will not benefit from this program , even though they may live right next door to somebody who will .
one family will benefit to the extent perhaps of $ 6,000 , $ 7,000 or $ 8,000 a year in mortgage payment tax credits , tax reductions or tax expenses , whereas the family next door will not .
that seems to me to be not only patently unfair but patently absurd as well .
we have a situation which is not fair across groups .
it is not fair across families in similar circumstances and it represents a significant tax break to some Canadians who are rather better off than others .
we have to ask where would that money come from and how much is involved .
i wonder whether the Reform Party through this bill is suggesting that indeed we should have capital gains taxes on principal residences because I am sure Canadians would be interested to learn that .
this bill is an expensive and unfair way and as a result I think will not see the light of day .
Mr. Art Hanger ( Calgary Northeast , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to rise today in support of Bill C - 223 and commend my colleague , the member for Portage - Lisgar , for his foresight in introducing such a bill .
i think it is worthy of debate and certainly worthy of the Liberal side to examine this whole issue of tax relief on mortgage interest .
i again would like to thank the member for Portage - Lisgar for introducing the bill .
it is certainly open for broader reference too , not only for first time home buyers but also for everyone who may own a home .
since this is my first formal speech in the House , Madam Speaker , during this 36 th Parliament , I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment and also the Speaker of the House on his election to the chair .
i have a great deal of regard for both the Speaker ' s position , the Chair , and the office .
i can assure you that you will have my full co - operation and respect throughout this Parliament .
i would like to thank too my constituents for once again placing their faith in me .
i am extremely grateful for the trust they have given to me .
i want to assure them publicly that I will represent their viewpoints and wishes as best I can .
i will certainly keep them uppermost in my mind as I carry out my duties here in the House .
we as parliamentarians should all be doing everything possible to change that and drive this economy with every means possible to make sure our young people , the future of our country , are working and feel positive about what this country has to offer them in the future .
unfortunately many of them do not feel that their future is all that bright .
besides the unemployed there are the under employed .
hundreds of thousands of working individuals are under employed .
they are barely getting by and most of the time on two incomes and still barely scraping by .
i think it is time for the government to take some urgent action to ensure that all Canadians enjoy the rich potential of this country .
as far as I am concerned , this private member ' s bill is a step in the right direction .
taken in a broad context , if everyone were to be given that relief , it would certainly be a real boon to the economy when one thinks about how many dollars are going to be thrown back into the economy .
a dollar in the hands of an employer , an employee or a consumer is much better handled than a dollar in the hands of any bureaucrat , any government official or any parliamentarian .
i would just like to list some of those advantages .
first is a considerably lower tax burden on Canadian families .
the member who introduced the bill certainly mentioned families a lot in his presentation .
it is very important to recognize the strengthening of the family , the desire that they not be subject to someone else ' s whims in a way like rental or leasing property but they would actually be able to own their own home .
it offers them more amenities .
one can actually buy a piece of property and be able to afford a few more items that they would not normally be able to afford because of that particular deduction .
people in this country are crying out for tax relief and yet it is falling on deaf ears .
those who are able to do something about it are not doing anything about it .
taxaholic is a term that our finance critic issued toward the finance minister and I think it is quite acceptable because every time there is a dollar loose somewhere it has to be grabbed .
they have to grab as many dollars as they can from those hard working people out there across the country .
i do not think that is acceptable especially when it is clear that the people in this country are fed up with taxes .
they want relief .
it is not the tax dollars that have to be replaced .
that is a well known fact .
this government spends precious little time doing anything that would support Canadian families in that regard .
this bill would allow the Liberals to have something concrete to demonstrate that their grandiose rhetoric has a bit of substance .
there is a dreadful lack of substance opposite .
owning a home is of great importance to families .
unfortunately it is becoming increasingly difficult for many Canadian families to realize their dreams and own their own homes .
bill C - 223 would give many lower income Canadians that extra bit of cash necessary to allow them to afford that dream .
it gives that extra little bit of room .
it would give first time home owners the breathing room necessary for them to pay down their other debts , to set aside moneys for saving or to spend more on their families and their needs in that regard .
how can the government possibly object to allowing Canadians the opportunity to spend more of their hard earned dollars on their families ?
i do not think when it comes right down to it that it can legitimately object , although I listened to the parliamentary secretary who made it very clear that it is not acceptable .
accessibility to home ownership is particularly important to our young Canadians .
they need a break and they have been hit especially hard by tough economic times .
they suffer from higher unemployment rates on average and they report a terrible rate of under employment .
again , I know the parliamentary secretary spoke about the shortfall in the tax system , but it is not acceptable .
i think many of these adjustments can be made incrementally but unfortunately the Liberal side is not even willing to entertain some of those very significant changes in the tax structure to offer some relief .
our generation of young people is the first in Canadian history who will likely not enjoy the economic benefits that this generation has , our parents have .
if we are not careful , home ownership will be another example .
i can relate what policies like this have done to other countries but I know I do not have enough time to really get into it .
it is unfortunate because I think this is a very key issue .
i can only urge the Liberals to recognize a good idea when they see it .
they have a habit of stealing good ideas and I think this is one they could steal .
i hope in the end they will support Bill C - 223 .
Mr. John Maloney ( Erie - Lincoln , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in the short time we have left I would like to make a few remarks on this bill .
i put it to you , Mr. Speaker , and to my friends opposite that it is possible to laud the intent of an idea without supporting the idea itself .
this proposal , despite its worthy aims , has flaws .
in addition , the home buyers plan allows first time home buyers to withdraw up to $ 20,000 from registered retirement savings plans to use toward the purchase of a principal residence .
these withdrawals are not subject to tax as long as the money is returned to the plan within a period of 15 years .
i would find it difficult explaining to these taxpayers why they are not as deserving of tax relief as others .
the taxpayer ' s choice of accommodation is really a personal decision and the costs associated with it are personal expenses .
it is not fair for taxpayers at large to subsidize the personal expenditures of others .
should this proposal be adopted , non - homeowners would find themselves subsidizing the home purchasing decisions of others .
the change proposed by the member of Parliament for Portage - Lisgar would primarily benefit higher income Canadians .
the great majority of benefits under the proposal would naturally accrue to higher income earners who are more likely to have larger mortgages .
the result would be an increased taxation of all Canadians to pay for the accommodation of the more fortunate .
i do not find this prospect a pleasing one .
i also feel this proposal would be sending out the wrong message by providing an incentive to enter into debt and maintain indebtedness .
a rational homeowner benefiting from a tax deduction for mortgage interest would see little need to pay down the outstanding principal .
by encouraging Canadians to carry larger mortgages for longer periods of time , we would be discouraging saving and financial independence .
surely , this is not the lesson we wish to pass on to young members of our society .
finally , we come to the issue of cost .
the Department of Finance estimates that the federal revenue loss associated with this proposal could reach $ 150 million in the year of introduction .
if deductibility were extended to all homeowners , the cost would reach $ 6 billion annually .
the provinces would also experience a substantial reduction in revenues .
this is a very hefty price tag by any standard .
i also wish to emphasize that the lower interest rates resulting from the government ' s deficit reduction strategy have significantly reduced the cost of home ownership .
one year mortgage rates today have declined by more than 400 basis points since January 1995 , providing savings greater than $ 3,000 in terms of lower annual mortgage payments for a $ 100,000 mortgage .
in conclusion , I am sure that those present here today would join me in improving the spirit of this proposal .
i would urge , however , that this spirit not sweep them along into supporting a measure that is not affordable , necessary or fair .
the Deputy Speaker :

the time provided for the consideration of Private Members ' Business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper .

amendment TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA
constitution ACT , 1867 .
the Constitution Act , 1867 , is amended by adding , immediately after section 93 , the following :
" 93 A .
paragraphs ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) of section 93 do not apply to Quebec . "
citation
speaker , on April 15 , 1997 , the Quebec National Assembly voted unanimously in favour of a resolution to amend the constitution and exempt Quebec from the application of paragraphs ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) of section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 .
this amendment would essentially put an end to the educational rights and privileges enjoyed by that province ' s Catholics and Protestants .
it would mean that Quebec could reorganize its school board system along linguistic rather than denominational lines .
this is why we decided to task a joint Senate and House of Commons committee with examining the various aspects of the proposed resolution .
the committee thus held public consultations during which about 60 groups and individuals were heard .
in the report it submitted on November 7 , it recommended that both Houses of Parliament adopt the resolution to amend section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 , as tabled in the House of Commons on October 1 , 1997 , and in the Senate on October 9 .
before I go any further , I would like to congratulate the committee members on the exemplary work they have done .
because of their efforts , it has been possible for many citizens and groups who so wished to express their points of view .
it has also been possible for parliamentarians to examine this highly complex issue from all angles .
i urge the House to follow the committee ' s recommendation and support the resolution to amend the constitution .
since parliamentarians have had an opportunity to consult the committee ' s report , I will merely go over the main points , with particular emphasis on the concerns identified by committee members and possible responses to those concerns .
first , there is the issue of the amending formula .
in its report , the committee began by looking at the applicable amendment procedure .
backed by legal advice , the Government of Canada held that section 93 could be amended bilaterally , in accordance with section 43 of the Constitution Act , 1982 .
most of the experts on constitutional law that the committee heard confirmed the government ' s position .
as stated in the committee report , " these experts maintained that the amendment requested affects only the province of Quebec , and they therefore concluded that the procedure involved could only be bilateral and required only a resolution by the Quebec National Assembly , the province concerned , and a resolution by the two Houses of the Canadian Parliament '' .
the work of the committee will therefore have been useful in dispelling any doubts that some people may have had on the appropriate amending procedure .
but what about the purpose of the resolution itself ?
some witnesses wondered whether it was appropriate to do away at this time with the safeguards provided under section 93 .
some people disagreed with the amendment on purely religious grounds .
they claimed that the right to receive Catholic or Protestant religious education for those who want it should be maintained , without however imposing such education on those who do not want it .
others argued that the creation of linguistic school boards did not require the amendment of section 93 .
based on Supreme Court decisions , they claimed that linguistic and denominational school boards could coexist .
although that last statement is basically true , the committee concluded it was not very realistic to keep a system of denominational school boards together with a system of linguistic school boards .
in fact , over the last 15 years , successive governments in Quebec have considered such an approach , and legislation to that effect was even adopted in 1988 .
all these governments ultimately backed down because of the tremendous difficulties that the implementation of such legislation would have created .
in fact , this would have created six school systems in Montreal and Quebec City , and greatly increased the number of religious schools , resulting in the scattering of resources .
this is why the representatives of the Quebec federation of school boards stated , and I quote , " By stacking the linguistic and denominational structures , it would become much more complicated and burdensome to carry out yearly activities related to student enrolment , assignment of personnel , distribution of resources , establishing voting lists and sharing the tax base '' .
that being said however , we must admit that the non - application to Quebec of subsections ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) of section 93 will result in the withdrawal of constitutional safeguards presently provided to Catholics and Protestants in that province .
there are however a number of considerations that soften the impact of this change .
it appears that , for all intents and purposes , the right of dissent is limited to the right to determine the religious dimensions of the curriculum .
moreover , it is solely in the territory of the cities of Montreal and Quebec City that section 93 guarantees Catholics and Protestants the right to school boards .
in short , the rights and privileges enjoyed by Catholics and Protestants now are as much as , if not more , from legislation than from the constitution .
in this connection , it must not be lost sight of either that the objective of the Government of Quebec is not to make the Quebec school system a lay system , but rather to make school structures non - denominational .
as Quebec ' s Minister of Education , Mrs. Marois , explained in her testimony before the joint committee , the constitutional amendment will have no immediate repercussions whatsoever on the place of religion in the schools .
that issue will be addressed in a separate public debate .
in the immediate future , therefore , the schools will retain their denominational orientation , and parents or children can continue to request religious or moral education in keeping with their convictions in the public educational facilities , as guaranteed in section 41 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms .
these considerations have certainly not convinced francophone protestants .
a number of members of that community came to the committee to state that protections of a legislative nature can never replace constitutional guarantees .
they indicated as well that , not only can the lawmakers modify the clauses currently authorizing religious teaching in the schools , they could also be forced to do so if the courts were to reach the conclusion that such teaching contravenes the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the charters as soon as section 93 ceases to be in effect .
without wishing to minimize the importance of this problem , we must place in its proper perspective .
first of all , a court would have to reach the conclusion that the solutions opted for by Quebec lawmakers in this connection infringe upon religious freedom and equality rights , and would also have to conclude that these restrictions are not reasonable within a free and democratic society .
in such a case , the supreme court could indicate the type of arrangement that was likely to meet the requirements of the Canadian and Quebec charters .
the highest court has often indicated that it did not intend to take the place of the lawmakers in arbitrating between the interests of the various groups in the community .
there are , therefore , grounds to believe that elected representatives retain a certain degree of flexibility in adjudicating between various individuals ' rights . >
as a last resort , the Government of Quebec could invoke the notwithstanding clause .
i was obviously very pleased to hear my counterpart , the Quebec minister of Canadian intergovernmental affairs , Jacques Brassard , say that " the notwithstanding clause would be invoked only as a last resort and with great care and diplomacy '' .
he is perfectly right .
it is a band - aid solution and should be used only exceptionally .
the joint committee shares our opinion on this .
attention must not be paid to a minority within a minority to a point where the growth of society as a whole is paralyzed .
other groups told the committee that the guarantees accorded under section 93 to Catholics and Protestants are at odds with Quebec ' s modern pluralistic society .
representatives of the Jewish and Arab communities in particular have pointed out that this section contains a form of discrimination .
this point too warrants consideration .
by passing the amendment proposed by Quebec ' s National Assembly , Parliament will permit an open and full debate on the whole question , which is what the Quebec minister of education promised , in fact , when she appeared before the committee .
in quite another vein , members of Quebec ' s anglophone community appeared before the committee to call for section 23 to be applied in its entirety so that individuals , whose first language learned and still understood is English but who did not receive their primary education in English in Canada , can send their children to English schools .
that was fair enough but the committee concluded that was another debate .
in effect , section 23 guarantees official language minorities the right to manage and control their own schools and even their own school boards .
a number of groups and experts confirmed that during their testimony to the committee .
in that respect the establishment of linguistic school board will enable the anglophone community to consolidate its school population of and gain the maximum benefit from the guarantees under section 23 .
i must also mention the concerns of the Native peoples living in Quebec .
two aboriginal groups representing the Metis and Indians living off the reserve have expressed concern over the possible effects of the proposed constitutional amendment .
they claim that their rights could be affected to the extent that this section protects the pre - Confederation laws governing instruction for Native peoples .
the Government of Canada is sensitive to their claims and it is certainly a legitimate concern for Native peoples to want to ensure the development of their culture through education .
however , we must recognize that this was not the intent given section 93 .
section 93 offers no special guarantee to Native peoples , except if they are Protestant or Catholic .
the committee shares our opinion in this regard .
consensus .
when I first raised the possibility of amending section 93 with Quebec intergovernmental affairs minister Jacques Brassard , I clearly indicated that the Government of Canada would support an amendment proposal if a reasonable consensus existed in Quebec and if the affected minority agreed .
this consensus was expressed in two unanimous votes in the National Assembly .
indeed , the Government of Quebec and official opposition members testified to this consensus during the joint committee hearings .
regardless , the fact that no public consultations dealing specifically with the constitutional amendment took place in Quebec raised doubts as to this consensus .
that is why the government insisted that interested groups and individuals be heard .
in fact , the joint committee said this was one of its primary concerns .
these groups and individuals came in large numbers and were given the opportunity to express their views .
the committee noted that the Assembly of Quebec Bishops is not opposed to the amendment .
the Quebec Federation of School Boards which represents all Catholic school boards in the province also supports the amendment .
the same is true for the Provincial Association of Catholic Teachers and the Centrale de l ' enseignement du Qu 茅 bec .
on the whole there is every indication that the vast majority of Catholics are open to the proposed change .
that support is not unanimous , as evidenced by the opposition of the Coalition of Denominational Schools .
however , it could not be expected that the challenging of the rights and privileges entrenched in the constitution for 130 years would be supported by all .
nevertheless the government and the committee believe that a broad consensus exists among Catholics who are not in any case a minority in Quebec and will still be able to express their opinion through democratic means .
a substantial consensus seems to exist among Protestants too .
since this will be the most directly affected group , it is important to ensure that a majority of the members of this group support the amendment ' s objective .
the Anglican Church came out in favour of the amendment , as did the Provincial Association of Protestant Teachers .
testimonies heard by the committee do show however that a reasonable consensus in favour of the amendment exists in this community and that is what the committee concluded .
many other groups testified before the committee .
the vast majority of these groups supported the constitutional amendment proposal .
to name a few : the F 茅 d 茅 ration des comit 茅 s de parents , which is the largest parents ' group in the province , the Coalition pour la d 茅 confessionnalisation scolaire , which is comprised of 40 organizations and claims to represent more than 2 million people , every central labour body in Quebec and representatives from the Jewish and Arab communities .
to conclude , based on the foregoing , there is no doubt that the consensus required to amend section 93 of the Constitution does exist .
overall , it appears that , although some witnesses expressed their concerns with respect to the proposed amendment , there is a consensus in Quebec society supporting this change '' .
it is now up to us to act on the joint committee ' s recommendation and adopt the resolution to amend section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 , as proposed in the House of Commons on October 1 , 1997 .
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will not be using my entire allotted time because I feel that the issue has been given a fair amount of attention and that many of the key issues have been explored in depth .
i would suggest that all members of the House read the majority and minority reports put forward by the joint committee addressing the issue .
in these reports my colleagues will find arguments both for and against the proposed amendment .
i support the proposed amendment to section 93 created and passed unanimously by the Quebec National Assembly .
i will ultimately be voting in favour of the amendment as recommended by the Special Joint Committee on Quebec Schools .
the Reform caucus believes in free votes when it comes to matters that involve certain moral considerations .
while I believe the issue is primarily a legal one , I appreciate the opportunity to be able to respectfully disagree with some of my colleagues .
while I have not polled my constituents directly on the issue , it is my belief that our party ' s commitment to returning education to the exclusive domain of the provinces would move all of them to support the amendment as well .
furthermore the amendment affects only the province of Quebec in any direct and meaningful way , which is why I believe the constituents of Edmonton - Strathcona have shown little interest in the matter .
the message I have heard is that what Quebec does with its schools should be its own business , provided fundamental rights are not violated .
putting aside the issue of provincial jurisdiction before making my decision on the matter , I asked myself three questions which I believe are fundamental to the proposal .
the first question I asked was of a legal nature .
is section 43 the right way to approach the amendment , or should the general amending formula be used in the matter ?
the second question I asked was political .
is there some evidence that the elimination of section 93 as it applies to Quebec has broad based support ?
the final question I asked was a moral one .
does section 93 protect religious freedoms , and would these freedoms suffer in Quebec with the passing of the proposed amendment ?
i would like to address the use of the section 43 amending formula .
there is some concern it is inappropriate when applied to the proposed amendment to section 93 .
instead it is argued that a general amending formula , or the 7 and 50 formula , should be used to facilitate the changes to denominational schools .
it is not only argued that this would be more appropriate , but also that it is the only legal approach to the proposed constitutional change .
ideally the question should have been put to the supreme court as was called for by the Leader of the Official Opposition .
however it did not happen and we must now deal with the question in the House .
from the perspective of a constitutional layman it would seem that section 43 is appropriate in this matter .
the section 43 amending formula is used for constitutional amendments that apply only to a single province .
in this case the single province is Quebec .
the counter argument has been made that the elimination of section 93 will lead to the elimination of denominational schools across Canada because section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms will prevent public funding for these schools .
because of this , it is argued that the general amending formula involving all provinces should be used .
however the amendment to section 93 is not the removal of section 93 from the Constitution .
it is an amendment that affects only Quebec in any direct and meaningful way .
it may admittedly create a precedent for other provinces , but whether or not the other provinces choose to act on this precedent is entirely their choice .
therefore the specific proposed amendment cannot be said to affect religious educational freedom in the rest of Canada .
for this reason I believe that section 43 is applicable in this case .
on the matter of consensus , Quebec seems strongly in favour of setting up linguistic school boards .
even if it seems less likely that it supports the proposed amendment to section 93 , such support probably exists .
i am pleased consultations were held in Quebec on establishing linguistic school boards .
in other words , I do not think it really matters to most Quebeckers just how the linguistic school boards are set up , as long as they are .
to get back to the matter of consensus , many groups stated that section 93 protects minority rights .
they said , on the one hand , that most Quebeckers object to the proposed amendment and , on the other , that the amendment is an example of a majority oppressing a minority .
we could say that minority rights are an issue here , but this argument cannot be used in conjunction with the argument that there is no consensus on the amendment .
to put the matter of consensus to rest , I would point out that the unanimous consent the National Assembly accorded the proposed resolution indicates that there is vast support for it .
it is unlikely that all politicians from all parties would ignore public opinion .
every time parties agree on an issue , I think it is because the issue raises little controversy .
that may not always be true , but I think it is in the present case .
let us move on to another point .
if the proposed amendment is passed , I fear Quebec and the rest of Canada will lose the right to freedom of religion .
that is really the crux of the matter .
if freedom of religion were infringed on , a consensus among Quebeckers would not be justified at all .
having heard the testimony received by the committee , I believe that section 93 is not essential to protect freedom of religion .
in fact , it could run counter to this objective .
in a pluralistic society like ours , should the government collect money from Muslims , for instance , in support of Catholic religious teaching ?
i think not .
under section 93 , however , the government could continue to support Christian religious teaching at the expense of other faiths .
is that how we want to promote freedom of religion in our schools ?
if section 93 protected freedom of speech , but this right was granted only to Protestants and Catholics , one could argue that it recognizes a privilege , not a right , enjoyed only by these two groups .
rights must be universal , otherwise they cannot be considered as rights .
therefore , the exclusive right conferred by section 93 is prejudicial in that it actually impinges on the right to religious teaching .
in addition , sections 21 and 36 of Bill 109 in Quebec provide for religious teaching where numbers warrant .
it appears to be necessary to carry out reforms to ensure that the wish to receive religious teaching is duly recognized and taken into account .
however , this seems to be another administrative problem that could easily be resolved at the public ' s request .
a provincial campaign to promote the right to choose among schools whose funding is prorated , or chartered schools , is the only way to help ensure that religious teaching remains an option and this can only be achieved by repealing section 93 .
to conclude , I think that matters relating to education should be exclusively under provincial jurisdiction .
i think that the amending formula used to expedite the adoption of this bill is a lawful one .
i believe there is in Quebec a political will to establish linguistic school boards .
and I know that religious freedom in Quebec will not be threatened if section 93 is repealed .
i am therefore in favour of this amendment .
i strongly recommend that my colleagues , the hon. members of this House , respect the wish of the Quebec National Assembly and heed the advice of the joint committee .
i urge them to vote for the proposed amendment .
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , first I want to thank the previous speaker and I hope his voice will be heard by his fellow party members , so as to create a movement which , hopefully , will reach the Reform Party ' s top level .
who knows , maybe the leader of the official opposition will surprise us by supporting the constitutional amendment .
this amendment was the subject of numerous debates .
the issue before us is deeply rooted in Quebec - I believe the minister said it six times in his speech - since the Parent report was released .
indeed , since the mid - sixties , all Quebec governments , regardless of their political colours , have tried to modernize the province ' s education system , and this is what we are talking about .
i am grateful to the minister for emphasizing - as he did throughout his speech - that the issue does not concern linguistic rights .
those interested in linguistic rights should read chapter 8 of Bill 101 , which contains the information relating to the language of access for the majority and the minority .
the fact is that a majority of Quebeckers feel that school boards should be structured along linguistic rather than religious lines .
we could not overemphasize the fact that , unfortunately , some people tried to muddle the real issue , for example by comparing the situation of francophones outside Quebec with that of anglophones in Quebec .
i believe that all committee members clearly realized that , as parliamentarians , our duty was to understand the objective sought by the National Assembly .
this is somewhat of a precedent since the National Assembly , which is the only authority that can speak on behalf of Quebeckers , was unanimous on this issue .
and all of us here should understand the meaning of the term " unanimous '' .
it means that when Pauline Marois , the member for Taillon , rose in the National Assembly to vote in favour of the motion , so did the member for Marquette .
when parliamentarians vote this unanimously , you can be sure we are on solid ground .
if we were to go a step further , and compare all the witnesses who were heard in the Quebec National Assembly with those who appeared before the joint parliamentary committee , it would be seen that there were , to all intents and purposes , no witnesses who were not heard either in Quebec City or here in Ottawa .
so those people who thought there had been no consultation must think again and acknowledge that there was extensive consultation in Quebec .
therefore , it is clear that there are two aspects to the motion now before us .
first , the preamble to section 93 says that education comes under provincial jurisdiction .
everyone , of course , understands that Quebec does not want this preamble revoked since , as far back as 1953 , the Tremblay Commission pointed out in no uncertain terms how essential it is for Quebec to have full and complete jurisdiction over the education sector , education being obviously linked , as we know , to identity .
why do we think this is important ?
why did a man like Claude Ryan , when he was Minister of Education and the MNA for Argenteuil , finally try to modernize the Quebec school system ?
Claude Ryan is a respected intellectual in Quebec society .
of course , he is no sovereignist , everyone knows that and I must say that , personally , I do not have much hope in that regard .
everyone knows that Claude Ryan is a respected and respectable individual .
he even submitted the issue to the Supreme Court .
he was constantly faced with this challenge , with the overbearing presence of section 93 , especially subsections ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) .
what this means is that when we vote today , and I think it is important to make this clear , it will be so that school boards can be organized along linguistic lines .
i insisted strongly in the joint committee on what this means for Montreal .
we all know that Montreal is in a very particular situation .
Montreal is where immigrants go ; 80 % of the immigrants that come to Quebec settle in Montreal .
every year Montreal welcomes close to 35,000 immigrants , or 15 % of Canada ' s total immigration .
close to 225,000 immigrants come to Canada each year .
Quebec has traditionally been open to immigrants , a tradition that is based of course on a low birth rate , but there is also a fundamental belief - and this is what the Bloc has been saying since it arrived in this House - that immigration is a force that contributes to the renewal of a society .
about 80 % of immigrants settle in Montreal .
for both historical and contemporary reasons , the majority of these immigrants enrol their children in English and Protestant schools .
what is good about the amendment on which we will be voting is that French schools will truly become public schools , especially in Montreal .
this is an objective that must be clearly understood .
again this will change nothing as far as admission requirements for the anglophone minority are concerned .
bill 101 provide for some very clear rules on which we did not always agree .
in the early 1980 s , the Supreme Court of Canada issued a ruling requiring the Quebec legislator - and I am sure the Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs will remember this - to replace the Quebec clause with the Canada clause .
recognizing this legal obligation , the Quebec legislator agreed to amend Bill 101 , even though the National Assembly was not enthusiastic about it .
so today it is the Canada clause that applies in Quebec .
this means that children whose parents received their primary education in English in Canada can enrol their children in English schools in Quebec .
it is very important to understand why this amendment we will be adopting , I hope , will help not only to modernize Quebec schools but also to strike a better balance in the greater Montreal area .
one of the arguments that was repeated again and again in our debate , but to which no one could reply adequately , concerned the principle under which the legislator could guarantee constitutional rights to two religious denominations .
why should Catholics and Protestants , in 1997 - 98 and in the year 2000 , benefit from a form of favouritism ?
both the Canadian and the Quebec charter mention the freedom to worship .
in a law - abiding society with charters that are constitutional or quasi - constitutional obligations requiring Quebec to guarantee certain rights , one must ask under what principle Catholics and Protestants should be treated with favouritism .
it must , of course , also be kept in mind - and it is important that this point be made perfectly clear - that what we are talking about is taking religion out of administrative structures , out of the school boards .
it is a good thing to debate the place of religion in the schools and I have some very definite ideas on the subject , but this Parliament is not the one to deal with that .
the Minister of Education , Mrs. Marois , a most extraordinary woman , has mandated a task force headed by Professor Proulx to report to the National Assembly on the place of religion in Quebec in the year 2000 .
when that report is tabled there will be public hearings , the holding of which is a tradition in Quebec , and the stakeholders will have an opportunity to be heard .
at that time , there will be a debate within Quebec society on the place people want religion to have .
what we are speaking of is the end of denominational school boards .
we are very optimistic on all sides that the amendment on which we will be voting in a couple of hours will be passed with a strong majority .
the next stage will be that , next year , parents such as those with children in Sainte - Jeanne - d ' Arc school in Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , will be given the opportunity at the beginning of the school year to choose between religion and ethics , and that will remain unchanged .
where the place of religion in the schools is concerned , parents will fully retain their right to demand a Catholic education for their children .
this is a right which is , as we know , also given in section 41 of the Quebec Charter of Rights , which has quasi - constitutional value .
in due course , the issue will be debated in the National Assembly .
we have also received all possible representations by eminent constitutional experts .
as you know , constitutionalists have done roaring business of late in Canada .
they came to us with the opinion that the vehicle was appropriate , for there had been some doubt on this .
i know that the official opposition had been assailed by doubts at a certain point , but no constitutional expert could be found to state that section 43 was not the right vehicle .
we know that the 1982 Constitution is complex , hair - splitting even , concerning amendment formulas , since there are five possibilities .
we have gone from one extreme to the other , because there was no amending formula for over 100 years .
canada was one of the few countries that had a written Constitution but no amending formula .
and now we have a complex and convoluted amending formula offering five options , but , in this case , I think we are making no mistake .
we made no mistake as members of Parliament or as members of the committee in stating that , following the representations made before us , the amending formula was the right one .
i also want to stress the fact that a debate was held in Quebec society and that there is a coalition representing some two million people .
that is not insignificant in a democracy .
there are not too many issues in which a group may come before a committee and say " I am speaking on behalf of 43 organizations '' , including school administrations , unions , the CEQ and parents ' committees .
all of them share the same vision for things and want us to pass the amendment before us .
these people are speaking for their individual organizations , and together represent two million people .
that is something pretty important and should move all those members who doubt a debate was held and think that the amendment has garnered little support in Quebec society .
i hope they will be convinced , because there is obviously a lot of public reaction on this issue in Quebec .
the minister was very eloquent and I was really pleased when he made the following statement before the parliamentary committee .
of course , political reality will prevail , but the minister was right when he said very eloquently that , from kindergarten to university , the speaking community has access to an integrated school system and control over its structures and institutions .
it comes as no surprise - and it must be pointed out - that , generally speaking , the English speaking community strongly supports the amendment , for two reasons .
first , because it provides increased access for that community and , from a management perspective , it means more control than the English speaking community currently has .
this is very important .
moreover , it will put an end to the rivalry between the anglophones enrolled in Protestant schools and those enrolled in Catholic schools .
it will allow them to consolidate their network and , of course , the teaching resources involved .
what did Mrs. Chambers tell us ?
in case you do not know her , Mrs. Chambers is the sister of philosopher Charles Taylor .
in 1992 , the Quebec government approached Mrs. Chambers and asked her to head a working group on access to the school system for anglophones .
the Chambers report also asks for the so - called universal clause , but this is a different issue which is outside the scope of this debate .
she reminded us about the Pag 茅 report and the unified school boards , which are related to the issue before us today .
if there are people in this House , particularly Reformers or members who were not here during the last Parliament , who think the issue was not debated in Quebec , they are mistaken , in my opinion .
the amendment was adopted unanimously , which is somethingquite rare in politics .
we also have to act quickly , since the measure will have a concrete impact on the Quebec school system .
while there were 158 school boards before , there will now only be 75 , which means that these school boards ' boundaries will have to be redefined .
the change also involves a different registration process and the redistribution of buildings between school boards .
therefore , it is important to act as quickly as possible , so that by July of next year the registration process and organizational restructuring can have been completed and that by next September linguistic school boards can be in place .
i thank all members of the House , beginning with the minister , for their real co - operation .
i do hope the same spirit of co - operation will prevail when dealing with other issues .
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , I rise today in support of the amendment to section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 .
this motion is particularly important because it proposes a constitutional amendment .
we must always proceed with great caution when amending provisions of our Constitution , for the impact will be felt for generations to come .
i had the pleasure of sitting on the committee responsible for studying the constitutional amendment .
it was my first experience on a parliamentary committee and I must say how much I appreciated the cordial atmosphere that characterized the committee ' s proceedings .
as a rookie in the House of Commons , I found it an excellent opportunity to learn from senators and members with many years ' experience .
the committee ' s work was truly motivated by a desire to arrive at a solution that would best serve the interests of Quebeckers and of Canadians .
i would like to thank my colleagues , who spent much time and effort during these three weeks in order to ensure that the groups affected by this amendment could be heard .
during the three weeks the committee sat , we had a chance to meet with a broad range of groups both in support of and opposed to the proposed constitutional amendment .
there was not complete consensus , as the Quebec government had led us to believe .
a number of religious communities and linguistic groups are opposed to the amendment to section 93 because they are afraid that the rights they have acquired will disappear .
the special joint committee on the Quebec school system therefore had an important job : to consult the people of Quebec and of Canada in order to ensure that all points of view were expressed and heard .
before looking at all those in favour of the constitutional amendment , I would first of all like to speak about those groups that are opposed .
numerous religious and linguistic groups travelled to Ottawa in order to make their concerns known .
the groups opposed to the amendment to section 93 expressed serious concerns about the status of minority rights in our Canadian society if the amendment is passed .
if these rights to education can be constantly revisited with very little public consultation , other minority rights are also vulnerable .
the Government of Quebec refused to hold public hearings on this issue and the minority concerned hardly had the opportunity to make its views known .
the minorities in question are the Protestants .
in Quebec , there are the Protestants and the Catholics .
in Quebec , Protestants were the minority .
those groups I heard in committee were minorities of minorities .
as legislators , we often forget that we represent the people .
we should never be afraid to consult the people .
they put us here and they can take us out .
i realize that the Government of Quebec had a strict timetable to follow , but it has no excuse for not setting up public hearings where people could have expressed their views , especially when the issue is the amendment of our Constitution .
lack of consultation is harmful not only to those groups who cannot have a voice , but also to the health of democracy in our country .
by consultation , I mean consultations through public meetings prior to the implementation of such changes or requests for change .
despite these difficulties , it is important to note that minority rights in Canada are not being compromised .
amending section 93 of the Constitution is a specific issue that affects Quebec only .
it has no impact on the rights of other minority communities in Quebec or elsewhere in Canada .
groups opposed to the amendment also told us of their concern about losing their denominational schools .
it should be noted that the purpose of amending section 93 is the abolition of denominational school boards in the cities of Quebec and Montreal .
the proposed changes do not prohibit Catholic or Protestant schools .
rather they affect how schools are managed .
i am concerned that acquired rights are being withdrawn to please the majority .
in my riding of Acadie - Bathurst , people fought long and hard to ensure that francophone schools in the communities of Saint - Sauveur , Saint - Simon et Sainte - Rose remain open .
let us not forget that people took to the streets in protest when the government attempted to close the schools .
this is why I say that I am very concerned whenever changes are proposed to the Constitution .
we must keep in mind that the RCMP used dogs , tear gas and nightsticks against children and parents .
this is why I feel so strongly about constitutional changes affecting schools .
our children ' s education is a very sensitive issue .
when new strategies on the management of our school systems are put forward , we should make sure that all aspects have been examined , hence the importance of consulting the public through public hearings .
i believe that the present situation in Quebec is one of the very few exceptions allowing us to question the privileges granted Protestant and Catholic communities .
let us not forget that section 93 protects only two denominational groups in two cities .
this means that people in the Gasp 茅 Peninsula , for example , enjoy no protection at all under section 93 as pertains to denominational education .
furthermore , all other denominational groups have no protection under section 93 .
the cultural context of 1867 may have justified the protection of only two denominational communities but the multicultural character of Quebec in 1997 could hardly justify protecting some communities and not the others .
there may not be unanimity in Quebec about section 93 but there is nonetheless a large consensus .
even the denominational groups that are affected support the amendment of section 93 because an amended section would better reflect Quebec ' s cultural and linguistic reality .
the Provincial Association of Catholic Teachers , which represents 3,000 teachers from 25 school boards in Quebec , supports the constitutional amendment because , under the current system , the English community is divided between two school systems .
it argues that religious education and denominational schools are still possible if the parents request it .
amending section 93 and setting up linguistic school boards will meet the needs of both the and the French community .
most groups that came before us believed linguistic school boards were a must .
if the Protestants and Catholics who are affected are in favour of amending section 93 , it would be irresponsible on our part to ignore such a consensus .
in spite of this fairly obvious consensus , our Reform friends would like a referendum .
do they not realize that a referendum cannot reflect the minority ' s interests ?
we are talking about minority rights here ; the will of the majority is only part of what we have to consider .
i would be more concerned about supporting the amendment to section 93 if all the political parties in Quebec were not in agreement .
however , when the National Assembly debated this issue , it was passed not only by a majority vote , but unanimously : 103 to zero .
we all know in this House how difficult it is to achieve unanimity on a particular issue .
if the National Assembly succeeded in securing unanimous consent on such controversial issues as language and religion , it must be recognized that voters as a whole had to be in agreement too .
i had another concern during committee hearings .
when we speak about denominational schools , we are speaking about the importance of communicating , through the school system , values that are fundamental to us .
however , we often forget that children are caught in difficult situations when religion is taught in schools .
i have a hard time admitting that Pierre will have to leave the classroom whenever the teacher speaks about Jesus because Pierre is a Jehovah ' s Witness .
we must think very carefully about what it means to teach religion in schools given our present cultural reality .
we must respect all the children attending our schools .
i pondered carefully over what was said in committee .
i even spoke with several priests in my riding and they think that religious education should be the responsibility of parents and not that of the schools .
the school should definitely convey fundamental values , but the true transmission of values should be done by the family and the church .
one of the most important roles we have as parents is to communicate to our children the beliefs and values that we consider as important .
to abandon this responsibility by relying on school teachers to do this job will clearly harm our children .
the amendment to section 93 shows how the federal government can serve Quebec ' s interests .
this situation shows how our country can be flexible in certain circumstances to put forward policies that reflect the specific needs of a province .
this co - operation between the provinces and the federal government is the foundation of the Canadian federation and , as a result , Canadians and Quebeckers come out of this as winners .
even though I support the proposed amendment , I still have concerns about the process that has led us to debate this issue .
i have indicated earlier and I will repeat that the Quebec government should have consulted the people of Quebec through public hearings .
the special joint committee , here in the federal Parliament , only had two weeks to hear witnesses .
because of the deadline that had been set , some groups had some difficulty coming to tell us about their concerns .
amending the Constitution should not be an exercise to be taken lightly and two weeks are not enough to go around such an issue .
fundamentally , the New Democratic Party respects Quebec ' s autonomy to establish linguistic school boards .
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) :
madam Speaker , I would like to share my experience as a member of the special joint committee charged with examining the resolution to amend section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 .
i believe we have no choice but to pass the resolution as tabled in the House of Commons on October 1 , 1997 .
the committee heard over 60 groups and individuals and , in my opinion , the message was clear .
as I said in the House at the beginning of this debate , as a member of Parliament from the Eastern Townships , I have some experience of the issue before us today .
the Eastern Townships have been a lead region with regard to linguistic school boards in Quebec for more than 15 years and , I want to say it again , the experiment was a success .
it is a good system that works well .
this has not always been the case , however .
i remember , when I was young , the priests used to rule people ' s lives .
when , as a young anglophone , I was going to school , I was not called an anglophone because it was understood that all anglophones were Protestants and all francophones were Catholics .
i was simply called a Protestant .
my French speaking friends were not allowed to enter a Protestant church , under penalty of eternal damnation .
however , I used to go to the francophone church , the Catholic church , and I realized there were more similarities than differences between us .
but the priests kept the anglophones and the francophones , the Protestants and the Catholics , apart .
the Catholic Church put religion into the hands of the schools , into the hands of the State .
in my opinion , it has been a bad decision .
why ?
because most of the teachers used to be brothers or nuns and Quebeckers were already beginning to move away from the Church , a big issue in terms of family values .
fortunately , things have progressed .
Canadian history is a succession of negotiations and partnerships .
these negotiations are still going on nowadays .
just like what made up the 18 th century was taken into account when the Quebec Act was negotiated , what makes up the Canadian and the Quebec societies must be taken into consideration as Canada heads into the 21 st century .
in fact , the Quebec society is not made up only of French speaking Catholics and English speaking Protestants .
the Quebec society is like the Canadian society , but with a little something extra .
bearing this reality in mind , the Quebec National Assembly overwhelmingly voted in favour of linguistic school boards .
a lot was said about protecting the rights of English speaking Quebeckers .
in fact , English will be better protected with linguistic school boards .
i am very pleased to have had the opportunity to sit on this committee and to learn a lot about the Constitution of my country .
the House must vote in favour of amending section 93 to make all of this possible .
i want to take some time now to address the dissenting opinion from the Reform Party .
when parliamentary debate began on this subject on October 1 , I admitted quite candidly that I had much to learn about the constitutional nuances of my country .
today I can say that I learned quite a lot while I sat with the committee , both from my colleagues and about my colleagues on the opposition side and the government side and , of course , from the witnesses who appeared before the committee .
however , I will say again that I have much to learn .
i do not want to say outright that the Reform Party has no feel for my country ' s history .
i do not relish telling the House that the Reform Party has no sense of what Canada is and how Canada came to be .
i have gone through the Reform Party ' s dissenting opinion and I feel that it is my obligation to the House and to my constituents to share my findings .
first , the Reform Party writes " the proposed amendment will eliminate the right to denominational schools , a right that has been protected since 1867 '' .
i expect that Reform members will not know about how that great event in 1867 came to pass .
accommodation and recognition of the need for accommodation predates 1867 .
in fact , the Quebec Act of 1774 provided accommodation between the partners of what we now call Canada .
there has always been negotiation in Canada .
indeed , that is what Canada is all about .
of course , I am no expert so I do not think it is my job to say that the Reform Party does not know what it is to be Canada .
second , the Reform Party writes that changing the constitution should never be done lightly or in haste .
this puzzles me .
is this is the same party that when addressing the issue of changing the constitution to address Newfoundland schools in this House just over a year ago led the chorus of " dispense , dispense '' ?
the Reform Party and , in all fairness , the government were in a rush to change the constitution then .
as an opposition party , the Reform Party did nothing .
third , the Reform Party mentions the need for democratic consent to protect minority rights .
does its version of democratic consent not mean majority rule ?
is it not the party of referenda ?
must I remind the Reform Party that there was democratic consent in the national assembly , and for this to pass there will be democratic consent in this House and in the other place .
i was quite sure this must have slipped in there by mistake .
those things happen .
but then I started to think that maybe what the Reform was trying to say was assent of the minority .
this , of course , is not the same thing as its version of democratic consent at all .
however , defending minority rights is not what the Reform Party is known for .
in fact , I do not think it is an exaggeration to say the Reform Party has a bad reputation with minority groups right across Canada .
of course , defending minority rights cannot be the message Reform wants to send out .
that leads me to number four .
reform says that it would prefer a provincial referendum .
having just defended minority rights , this one is difficult to figure out .
in the same dissenting opinion it defends minority rights and then calls for a referendum .
of course , I am no expert but does the majority not always win referendums ?
is this some sort of joke ?
of course , the leader of the Reform Party is not known for his rapier like wit but more his rapier like logic .
i think his party has written an illogical dissenting opinion and I do not think it is very funny .
until this point , the Reform Party ' s dissenting opinion was just a series of contradictions and a little sloppiness .
i am sad to say that this is where the Reform Party becomes insulting .
is the Reform Party suggesting that officials elected to the national assembly cannot represent informed opinion in Quebec ?
they inform me .
i inform the House of their concerns .
number six , Reform says that those who oppose should be given a clear opportunity to express their view .
this new Reform principle allows minorities not only to express their point of view but to be heard in a proper forum .
not being an expert but knowing the Reform Party as I do , I wonder if this too slipped in here by mistake .
if it is meant to be there , I am happy to hear this and I will be watching to ensure the Reform Party upholds its new values .
i am in complete agreement with that statement .
i am happy to see the Reform Party finally sees merit in considering important matters fully .
i wonder if now it has changed its position on the necessity of the Senate of Canada and the sober second thought it brings to parliamentary matters .
the other place has what is called a suspensive veto .
this provides for the opportunity for revisiting constitutional endeavours .
as long as there is a Senate there are no artificial deadlines .
thank goodness for the Senate of Canada .
i am thankful that the Reform Party sees eye to eye with me on this .
number eight , the Reform Party complains that there was not enough time to study this matter , that it was done lightly and in haste .
it suggests that a court decision would have settled the legal issue .
again , I am no expert but I do not want to unfairly criticize anybody .
that is what it means to be a legislator .
it seems to me that the call for a court to decide on this issue is a complete abdication of governance and a complete abdication of leadership .
number nine , in addition to number eight , Reform calls for the best legal advice available .
i am sorry to hear that the Reform Party leadership is not confident in its ability to obtain or produce good legal advice .
in our caucus we have good legal advice .
we have parliamentarians who meet their responsibilities head on .
i am personally grateful to Senator Gerald Beaudoin , a noted constitutional expert who has been most helpful on the committee , helping everyone better understand the issues .
the Reform Party should have listened to him more closely .
however , if the Reform Party is looking for the best legal advice available , I invite it to call on our House leader or even our party leader .
perhaps what the Reform Party means is that it was vital to the negotiation of the BNA act , but if that is what the Reform Party meant to say , then why did it not say that ?
number eleven , I do not mean to tell the Reform Party what it surely already knows .
although if the Reform Party was aware of this , I do not know how the following got in here .
maybe just another error .
these things happen .
once again I quote " provincial statutes are clearly inferior to constitutional provisions protecting minority rights '' .
it obviously should not be me informing the Reform Party of this .
less than two weeks ago the Supreme Court of Canada listened to a case , Vri 茅 nd v Alberta .
in this case the province of Alberta , and if I am not mistaken the Reform Party draws much of its strength from there , stood before the Supreme Court of Canada to defend its refusal to extend protection against discrimination in its human rights legislation .
in short , the province of Alberta is arguing that its provincial statute is clearly superior to constitutional provisions protecting minority rights , prohibiting discrimination .
either there is a blatant area in this dissenting opinion or the Reform Party is in direct opposition to the province of Alberta .
in one two - page document the Reform Party insults Quebec and contradicts Alberta .
number twelve , the Reform Party says compelling reasons for amending the constitution have to be made and then adds no such case was made to committee .
again , I am no expert but I do recognize when a two page document contracts itself over and over .
earlier in the same document the Reform Party says " we do not question that an overwhelming consensus has been shown '' .
i do not want to say that the Reform Party does not know what it is talking about , so I put the question forward .
it appears its left hand - no , let me get this straight - its right hand has no idea of what the other right hand is doing .
the committee heard from more than 60 organizations and individuals , anglophones , francophones , Protestants , Catholics , Jews and aboriginals .
there was a strong case made to amend section 93 .
i suppose the Reform Party was not watching .
i am still learning in Ottawa .
we are all here to better understand Canada and to make Canada better .
i do not want to say the Reform Party does not understand Canada , but the Reform Party ' s dissenting opinion is contradictory , uninformed and without merit .
i hope this helps the Reform Party reflect on its dissenting opinion .
i invite the Reform Party to reconsider its position and make the recommendations of the committee unanimous .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I was disappointed that the hon. member spent half the time of his speech on this important historic constitutional amendment making cheap , sarcastic , partisan remarks which were entirely out of place in this debate .
there is a time for that kind of thing in this House but this is not one of those times .
this hon. member stooped to pretty low levels in his comments .
one of his first comments was that the Reform Party does not understand his Canada .
it is not just his country , it is mine as well .
it is our country .
i understand this history pretty darn well .
before this debate started I read the Confederation debates from cover to cover .
i challenge the member or any one of his caucus to go up in a history test anytime with the hon. Leader of the Opposition who probably knows more about the history of this country in the compact of Confederation than virtually any member of this place .
sir Charles Tupper said in 1896 that without the guarantee of section 93 for the rights of minorities being embodied in the new constitution , we should have been unable to have obtained any confederation whatever .
what the hon. member is seeking to remove from the constitution today in terms of its application to Quebec is the basic compact of Confederation in the words of the supreme court , in the words of Peter Hogg , our pre - eminent constitutional authority .
part of my objection to this amendment is predicated on our history , on our historical recognition of the rights of minorities and the confessional rights of parents to send their children to the educational institution of their choice .
the hon. member talked about consensus .
he said that the members of the national assembly were acting responsibly and demonstrating democratic consent .
what about the quarter of a million Quebeckers who signed a petition objecting to this amendment ?
what about the coalition that represents 600,000 Quebeckers that came before the committee objecting to this amendment ?
what about half the witnesses , francophone witnesses , Catholic witnesses , Protestant witnesses , witnesses with many different backgrounds who are opposed to this amendment because it removes and extinguishes forever a basic constitutional right and a basic civil right , the right of parents to choose the education of their children ?
what about those witnesses ?
they were not represented at the national assembly because it did not have hearings .
it would not know what they had to say about this .
there has been no debate about the confessionnalit 茅 implications of the removal of section 93 .
and this member preens on members of Parliament acting responsibly .
i sat as an associate on the committee and I recall this member hardly being at even half the hearings .
i do not recall him being at the clause by clause review where we wrote the majority report , where Reform made many positive and constructive amendments which found their way into the majority report .
i will ask this member a question .
with all partisan nonsense aside , does he not recognize that when we remove section 93 , the full force of the charter will apply to the Quebec education system and that if we are to take the judicial precedents in Ontario as a guide we will see that the confessional education elements of the Quebec education act will be found unconstitutional ?
does he not recognize the almost unanimous legal opinions brought before the committee that the confessional elements of the Quebec school system will be threatened by the charter if section 93 is removed ?
forget the partisan stuff .
Mr. David Price :
i do not understand -
Mr. Jason Kenney :
i never heard you , that ' s why .
Mr. David Price :
do not forget I was last on the list .
we had three senators there .
i was taking my information from them .
the member does not really understand .
that is why I will go back to the basics .
what I am looking for here is the best for our kids in Quebec .
i am a Quebecker .
i go back seven generations in Quebec and I am looking for the best we can get for our kids .
our school system right now in my area is linguistic .
it works well .
i know it is going to work .
it is giving the minorities a chance .
that is why the minorities were going there .
we did not see minorities coming out of areas like Montreal where they do not have it right now .
they do have it in our area and it works .
that is the bottom line as far as I am concerned .
i want something that works that will be the best for the kids .
the hon. member ' s stuff is in here .
i do not know why he is complaining about it .
he wrote it down .
this is dissenting opinion .
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris - Moose Mountain , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I was not going to speak on this but I decided to when the hon. member got up .
this is very close to my work throughout my entire life .
he suggests we do not know anything about this problem we have .
i suggest to him that the word conservative in the histories of Saskatchewan , Manitoba and Alberta as it relates to the school system is a bad word .
it is a bad word .
so any time a Conservative stands up and tries to tell me that Reform does not know anything about this country I will tell him this .
we know a whole lot about the country that he has forgotten or he never knew .
i have in my possession petitions signed by constituents who know what their forefathers went through in the formation of the province of Saskatchewan . There are some from Manitoba as well who say that we should take great care preserving that section .
they do not want a repeat of history .
they do not want a repeat of Conservative governments in the provincial house in Saskatchewan ordering minorities to close their doors or to take out certain textbooks .
Alberta does not want it and certainly Manitoba does not want it .
the three prairie provinces are satisfied with their school systems .
even the slightest minorities are given an opportunity .
i want to preserve that .
Saskatchewan in total wants to preserve it .
we do not want somebody messing around , providing a little break in the armour so that minorities could some day be challenged by another Conservative Party .
god forbid that .
i am saying clearly that I have looked at the matter and taken the advice of my people , the people whom I represent .
they are worried about the toe getting in the door once more .
the minority rights they have enjoyed for three generations could conceivably go out the window .
it is not just a one province debate .
it covers all of Canada .
Mr. David Price :
we are only speaking about section 93 and how it affects Quebec .
the member ' s party wrote the dissenting opinion .
it really does not make any sense .
we are protecting minority rights in Quebec .
it is the only way we can do it .
we cannot do it with section 93 in place .
we cannot do it .
Mr. Paul DeVillers ( Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to be able to speak to the resolution today .
i feel it represents a positive step for Canadians in many ways .
as a result of 30 years of discussion the amendment will reflect the pluralism of Quebec society .
many of my colleagues will be discussing the substantive and emotive elements of the proposed resolution .
i would like to speak on the procedural elements of the resolution as I feel they explain many of the questions surrounding the change .
finally I would like to add some personal reflections on the issue .
let me begin my presentation with a discussion on the bilateral nature of the proposed amendment .
the Constitution Act , 1982 , provides for amendments in section 43 " in relation to any provision that applies to one or more but not all provinces '' .
procedurally such an amendment requires the resolution of three bodies : the Senate , the House of Commons and the provincial legislative assembly requesting the amendment .
we are in the process of ensuring those basic procedural requirements .
let us go beyond the basics of the procedural elements .
the joint committee heard that the political validity of the resolution of any of these three bodies depended on the evidence of consensus .
the Quebec legislative assembly passed its resolutions unanimously .
this may be evidence of some consensus , as the legislative assembly includes members of minority communities in Quebec .
however , I feel we must look further for evidence of consensus .
particularly when a legislature is considering changes to constitutional guarantees of rights , it is critical that the minority affected by the change be aware of the proposal .
further I believe it is critical that a majority of the minority affected be supportive of the proposal .
in the case of the amendment to section 93 of the Constitution Act I believe that a majority of the minority affected support the amendment .
this conclusion is based on evidence I heard during the committee hearings .
anglophones , Catholics , Protestants and non - denominational groups were in support of the change .
i draw the attention of the House particularly to the support of the Anglican bishops and the Canadian Jewish Congress for the amendment .
the Catholic bishops were not opposed .
the Right Reverend Andrew Hutchison , Bishop of Montreal for the Anglican Church of Canada , stated in his letter attached to the report tabled in the House :
our conviction is that the state must exemplify and uphold the principle of equality before the law in dealing with the major religious traditions that have long been part of our Quebec community .
therefore not only does the Anglican church support the resolution on the basis of religious education being a family matter , but it feels that all major religious traditions must be treated equally in Quebec .
i am proud the government decided to hold committee hearings and invite testimony about the resolution .
after having attended all the hearings I am personally satisfied there is a consensus on the amendment .
i am satisfied a majority of the minority affected by the change support it .
as a franco - Ontarian the support of the majority of the minority is what I expect from any province that intends to change its minority rights guarantees in any area .
before I move to the next section of my presentation I invite my Reform colleagues to consider the following .
the Right Reverend Andrew Hutchison of the Anglican church stated that its support of the amendment was based on its firm conviction that religious education of children was primarily a family responsibility .
given the Reform stand on the importance of traditional families and family values , why is it not supporting the amendment ?
the amendment is an opportunity to reinforce the role of the family in the moral and religious education of children .
i would like to mention here the impact of this discussion on my own riding .
anybody familiar with Ontario history knows the Penetanguishene area has been troubled by school issues in the 1960 s and 1970 s .
to give you an idea of the situation in my own region , let me remind you we have seven schools in Penetanguishene .
we have English and French public schools , English and French Catholic schools , and one English Protestant school and school board .
i am well aware of the divisions this plethora of school boards can create in a minority community .
that is why I understand and support this initiative that will allow the minority community in Quebec to unite .
i think this amendment will help minority communities in Quebec to consolidate and benefit from it .
members in several parties in the House are afraid that this will create a legal and political precedent for the abolition of the rights of official language and religious minorities .
i would like to address this concern if I may .
i agree that this will create a political precedent in amending official language and religious minority rights , but I think it will be a good precedent .
any other government - and I am thinking of Ontario premier Mike Harris who would like to somehow amend the rights of Franco - Ontarians and Catholics - would have to meet the same criteria .
it will have to demonstrate that the proposed amendment is supported by a majority of the members of the minority affected .
furthermore , this support should be confirmed not only by a vote of the provincial legislature but also by witnesses before a Canadian parliamentary committee .
this is another reason why I am proud of the decision by this government to conduct hearings .
it created a precedent for any future government which could be less vigilant than this one .
finally , this constitutional amendment proves beyond any doubt that a people ' s needs and desires can be accommodated within the federal system .
i am glad we can show Quebeckers how the Canadian Parliament has played a productive role in this amendment .
after a 30 - year - old debate in Quebec society , this amendment will soon be a reality .
can we learn from this in the debate on national unity ?
i hope so .
after 30 years of debate on national unity we could perhaps solve the problem through a constitutional amendment or some other means .
federalists and Quebec separatists will perhaps finally opt for a unanimous vote on a resolution proposal .
perhaps the other provinces will see this amendment as the result of co - operation .
if this could be a side effect of this amendment , we would have done a good job .
for all these reasons , I urge my colleagues in this House to support this resolution .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I commend the hon. member for his remarks and diligent participation in committee .
he is undoubtedly sincere .
i have a couple of questions for him .
he and his minister both mentioned a number of groups in favour of the amendment that appeared before the joint committee .
i notice , however , that neither he nor his minister mentioned the several groups against the amendment that appeared before the committee .
i am afraid this rather unbalanced presentation of the committee ' s hearings may mislead some members of the House with respect to the lack of consensus in committee .
could he elucidate for his colleagues some of the groups against the amendment that appeared before the committee ?
he said there had been a 30 year debate about the question in Quebec society , an assertion repeated by several speakers this morning .
the hon. member knows that the debate over the past three decades in Quebec society has dealt with the establishment of linguistic school boards and not with the extinguishment of confessional school guarantees provided for in section 93 .
he will know that this matter was not dealt with seriously in the report of the estates general a couple of years ago .
he will know that this is a relatively recent proposal , one which passed through the Quebec National Assembly without public hearings .
will he admit that there has not in fact been 30 years of debate about the amendment to section 93 before us today but that the debate pertained to the establishment of linguistic school boards ?
my final question relates to the position of the Quebec Catholic bishops .
the hon. member said , as did his minister , that the Quebec bishops were not opposed to the amendment .
Mr. Paul DeVillers :
madam Speaker , the member asked why in my speech and in the minister ' s speech we did not list the witnesses who were opposed .
i think the report of the committee which was tabled in the House goes through that very , very clearly and in much detail .
no one is suggesting that the consensus was unanimous .
the committee heard that it is pretty well unanimous on the question of moving to a linguistic school system .
but the consensus is far from unanimous on whether it should be accomplished by the proposed amendments to section 93 .
there is no question and nobody was trying mislead any member or the House .
there were a lot of witnesses who gave testimony that they were not in favour of the amendment that we are debating here today proceeding .
however , from evidence I heard and from weighing the representations of the various witnesses , there is no question in my mind that there is a very strong consensus that the amendment proceed .
members of the committee asked witnesses specifically , given the fact that we are removing entrenched rights , did they still favour it being proceeded with .
in my opinion and in the opinion of the majority of the committee , that consensus was very clearly demonstrated .
if the member feels that I was misleading anyone , I certainly wish to assure him that is not the case .
there is no question of attempting to mislead anyone .
it is still my very strong opinion that there is a strong consensus in the Province of Quebec that we proceed with this amendment .
the member says that reference has been made to this being a 30 - year old debate .
he is partly correct .
we have not necessarily been talking about amending section 43 of the Constitutional Act of 1982 for 30 years .
however , the whole question of managing the school system in Quebec is a debate that has been going on for approximately 30 years .
the issue has been studied by commission after commission , all of which is referred to in the report dealing with going from a denominational to a linguistic school system .
in recent years the question of the process of using section 93 has been reviewed and proposed .
there were committee hearings and the Quebec legislature has dealt with it .
in his final question the hon. member asked me about the position of the Catholic Bishops .
i think I quite correctly stated in my comment that the Catholic Bishops were not opposed to the amendment .
however , they still favour denominational schools .
i have tabled an excerpt from an interview with a Quebec Bishop saying that he was satisfied to leave it to the state to decide how to implement the required changes and he was satisfied that there were measures in Quebec law , the Quebec Charter of Rights and the Quebec Education Act that would ensure their conditions were met and that there would be denominational schools .
the committee heard evidence that it is a very strong position in Quebec society that people want to retain denominational schools .
i think the political realities will ensure that .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
madam Speaker , the hon. member on the government side said that the Catholic bishops were in favour of this change .
the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops asked the members of the House of Commons and the members of the Senate of Canada to weigh carefully the implications of this proposal and to indicate that they cannot associate themselves with the passage of legislation that would deprive minorities of religious and educational rights .
as well , when this was first discussed about linguistic school boards , the protection of section 93 was not even being considered at that time .
therefore I have a major concern .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
Mr. Paul DeVillers :
madam Speaker , the hon. member says I indicated that the Catholic bishops were in favour .
i did not say that .
however , I am not saying that at any time did they say they were in favour of it .
they were saying that they were leaving that to the state to deal with .
with respect to the member ' s final point dealing with minority rights , I very clearly stated in my presentation that I believe constitutionally entrenched minority rights can only be dealt with when there is a very clear demonstration that the majority of the minority who are affected are in favour of it .
i believe that is what we are dealing with in this case .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I rise on behalf of the official opposition to speak to the proposed changes to the Constitution Act , 1867 , to amend paragraphs ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) of section 93 , which provide for the creation of denominational school boards in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario .
i want to be clear : the official opposition supports the idea of linguistic school boards .
we are not opposed to the creation of a better school system or a school system where groups are formed on the basis of language .
however , this amendment is neither about linguistic school boards , nor about modernizing the school system in Quebec , nor about giving parents more power in choosing an education system for their children .
this amendment is about taking away minority rights which are guaranteed in the Constitution and protected by the federal government .
i will repeat : the Reform Party is not opposed to the establishment of linguistic school boards .
however , it cannot condone the abrogation of vested rights without the consent of those directly affected .
we have outlined in our debate in the House three tests for amendments of this nature .
the first is a test of democratic consent and by this we mean not only the consent of the majority but as the parliamentary secretary says , the majority of the minority and the majority of the groups directly affected .
parliament must be satisfied that Quebec citizens were well informed about the proposed amendment and its implications radically consulted by the government and that a majority of those affected are in favour of the amendment .
the second test that we have outlined is that the change must respect the rule of law and that it must not prejudicially affect minority rights .
in other words , the correct amending formula must be used and we must be certain that we are not offending the very right guaranteed in section 93 , not to prejudicially affect the rights of professional groups .
the Quebec National Assembly suggests that section 43 of the Constitution Act specifies the applicable amending formula but we do not believe it has made a case that this does not prejudicially affect minority rights .
the third test is that the amendment must be in the national interest .
parliament must determine whether the actions of one province affecting education rights may create a significant precedent regarding the educational rights of Canadians in other provinces .
with respect to the first test , the committee was informed that the national assembly and the public have addressed the issue of linguistic school boards for the past three decades .
we just heard from the parliamentary secretary that this is not the case .
what has been debated in the past is the establishment of linguistic school boards .
there seems to be a unanimous consensus in favour in Quebec from all quarters .
however , the proposed amendment before us today has not had that kind of rigorous discussion .
the parliamentary secretary just said that in the past few years it has had some public scrutiny .
i suggest that what he really means to say is in the past year .
the implications of this amendment have really not been seriously debated .
the problem here is that we are talking about extinguishing a right which was central to the compact of Confederation .
the Supreme Court of Canada has said that section 93 represents a central part of that compact .
Peter Hogg , one of our leading constitutional experts , says that it is in itself a miniature bill of rights , that section 93 was that important to the heart of Confederation .
what we are discussing here is not some administrative realignment of the Quebec school system .
as I have said , that is something that we support .
education administration is a provincial responsibility and we do not object to that .
however , what the Constitution does is to vest in this Parliament the power to protect the rights of minority groups and groups empowered with educational rights at the time of Confederation .
those Fathers of Confederation put that amendment in place in 1867 because they anticipated a debate like this might happen today in this House .
by my count , roughly half of those witnesses opposed the proposed amendment .
most interesting is that the only groups that I recall - ordinary parents , people who were the most directly affected and who came before the committee to ask that this Parliament not approve the amendment - were those opposed to the amendment .
on the first days of the hearings we had a room full of parents opposed to the amendment .
these people were not lawyers , education bureaucrats or politicians .
they were parents concerned about how this would affect their educational rights .
many other groups appeared before the committee , including constitutional law experts , who indicated that this amendment would threaten and eventually extinguish confessional school rights in Quebec .
i see I am out of time .
i will continue my comments after question period .
the Speaker :
of course .
you still have approximately 13 minutes and the floor will still be yours when we resume debate after the question period .
it being almost 2 p.m. , we will now proceed to statements by members .
statements BY MEMBERS
living ART CENTRE
Ms. Carolyn Parrish ( Mississauga Centre , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise in the House today to note the successful official opening of the Living Art Centre in Mississauga .
it is a unique multi - purpose facility combining traditional art forms and leading edge technology .
the centre will broadcast and receive worldwide transmissions of voice and video data and will utilize three performing areas , meeting , conference , studio and instructional facilities .
the $ 68 million project was completed under the Canada - Ontario infrastructure works program with the federal and provincial partners each contributing $ 13 million , the region of Peel $ 5 million , the city of Mississauga $ 20 million and a further $ 30 million being provided by the private sector .
the Living Arts Centre is a perfect illustration of the government ' s commitment to the enhancement of cultural life everywhere in Canada .
i am proud to see that arts , technology and community efforts work hand in hand in Mississauga .
* * *
veterans
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today on behalf of the veterans of Canada , particularly the Koncentration Lager Buchenwald Club .
remembrance Day is not yet a week old and the government has apparently forgotten the sacrifices of Canadian airmen wrongfully imprisoned in Buchenwald concentration camp during the second world war .
i call on the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Liberal government to turn up the political pressure on Germany to ensure the few remaining veterans of this horrible experience receive their long overdue compensation for the atrocities committed against them at that time .
now is not the time to weigh trade treaties against what is right and wrong .
we must act now .
* * *
health
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) :
the spread of AIDS is alarming .
it has been described as an epidemic .
thankfully the government has recognized the gravity of the problem and has taken action .
i applaud the minister for allocating funds to the crisis and I thank all my colleagues in the House who promoted the intervention of Health Canada .

BOULANGERIE SAINT - M 脡 THODE
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to acknowledge in this House the determination of the Faucher family , of Saint - M 茅 thode , and its concern for a job well done .
their family operation was granted the prestigious ISO - 9002 standard of total quality .
this is a first in Quebec , as Boulangerie Saint - M 茅 thode will become the first such business to achieve this high standard of quality .
this bakery ' s outstanding products are the pride of the asbestos producing region .
every day for the past 50 years , our community has been able to literally taste the care the Faucher family puts into baking quality products .
i for one believe that the main ingredient in the Faucher family ' s winning recipe remains its great respect for its employees and their expertise .
long live Boulangerie Saint - M 茅 thode .

francophone SUMMIT
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the next Francophone Summit , whose theme will be youth , will be held in Moncton , New Brunswick , in September 1999 .
this will be yet another occasion for French speaking countries to gather to sign cultural and economic agreements , which will further strengthen ties between participants .
it will provide an opportunity to review action taken to carry out commitments made recently at the Hanoi summit .
we are happy for the Acadian community , which will seize this unique opportunity to sign agreements and establish relationships with other French speaking countries around the world .
our congratulations to New Brunswick and the best of luck to the Acadian community in preparing to host this summit .
* * *
reform PARTY OF CANADA
Mr. Joe Jordan ( Leeds - Grenville , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to bring to the attention of the House an impending tragedy .
the grassroots movement known to us affectionately as the Reform Party is undergoing a major transition .
armed with a newly renovated house , designer suits and hair styles that change shade more often than mood rings , the Reform Party is quickly becoming the very demon it was created to slay .
the Reform leader now has an insulated work boot planted firmly in the oil patch and is attempting to stretch a Gucci shoe to the boardrooms of Toronto .
i suggest that we put the Commons health services on full alert because there is not enough A 535 on the planet to soothe the ideological groin pull that is going to result from this , not to mention the ankle sprain as they fall off their soap box .

health
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris - Moose Mountain , Ref. ) :
the new health care centre which is under construction will contain space for laboratory , radiology , community health services , a medical clinic , emergency , observation and maternity rooms as well as six acute care beds .
the Redvers and District Community Health Foundation Inc. is building the centre without one cent of provincial money and without one cent of federal money .
once again local initiative leads the people in my constituency .
* * *
international TRADE
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) :
the three day Canadian business women ' s international trade mission was designed to introduce potential exporters to the U.S. market and specifically to export business opportunities and form partnerships in the the mid - Atlantic states .
canada ' s exports to that region amounted to $ 11.5 million in 1996 .
the program enables Canadian participants to pursue business opportunities with U.S. firms through mentoring , networking and partnering activities .
the participants attended a series of export development workshops on topics ranging from export strategies to marketing and international business financing .
our team Canada trade missions are the type of leadership the government provides to ensure that Canada continues to prosper into the new century .
* * *
drinking WATER
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , is Canada truly the " best country in the world to live in '' ?
two weeks ago , the Minister of Health told us that drinking water comes under provincial jurisdiction , while the equipment used to transport it is the federal government ' s responsibility .
nothing surprises us any longer , since we already know that in Quebec the bottom of the St. Lawrence River comes under federal jurisdiction , while the water itself is the responsibility of the province .
fish is a federal responsibility but , once out of the water , it becomes a provincial one .
fishers ' boats are registered under federal laws , but their construction is subject to provincial standards and , of course , federal safety regulations .
the shores of the St. Lawrence come under provincial jurisdiction , but ports belong to the federal government .
we have to get out of this mess .
* * *
bloc QUEBECOIS
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , last week , the former Bloc Quebecois leader said his party should leave the scene .
at last , a sovereignist has suddenly realized that the Bloc Quebecois was taking root , in spite of claiming to be a temporary party .
it is the first time that a Bloc Quebecois official alludes so openly to the possibility of a defeat of the yes side in a future referendum .
the former leader also feels that , win or lose , the Bloc Quebecois should leave after the next referendum .
under the circumstances , and until its demise , the Bloc Quebecois should work much more seriously to try to improve Canadian federalism .
it is time for the Bloc to take on this task .
* * *
immigration
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , once again I must outline an excellent example of the inability of the Liberal government to deport illegal immigrants .
the Baljinder Dhillon family of Abbotsford was ordered removed from Canada in 1993 but never left the country .
the family merely waited for three years to go by before applying under the DROC , that is the deferred removal order class program , to be allowed to stay because during these three years they had established ties in Canada .
i continue to be amazed that Immigration Canada has neither the physical ability nor the desire to deport people who have been under removal for more than four years .
in this instance I wonder why Immigration Canada bothered to order the family removed in the first place .
why carry the ball all the way down the field only to drop it ?
* * *
ASIA - PACIFIC
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan ( Winnipeg North - St.
Mr. Speaker , this week and next the eyes of the world will be fixed upon Canada when it hosts the Asia - Pacific Economic Co - operation forum , the culmination of Canada ' s year of Asia - Pacific .
the forum is a golden opportunity for Canada to help APEC move in a direction which reflects the needs and values of Canadians and to expand its influence in the region .
APEC members have a combined gross national product of $ 16 trillion U.S. , which is about half the world ' s annual trade .
last year Canada ' s trade with APEC members , excluding the United States , reached $ 58.6 billion .
the Prime Minister has underlined the importance to Canada ' s economic future of bringing APEC to Canada for developments in Asia - Pacific touch the lives of Canadians more and more as a result of growing business , immigration and cultural ties .
canada must commit itself , in addition to continued economic engagement , to learning more about the cultures of our neighbours thereby reinforcing economic co - operation in the Asia - Pacific region on the basis of shared partnership , shared responsibility and common good .
* * *
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the anniversary of the death of Louis Riel was yesterday .
i know I speak on behalf of my colleague , the hon. member for Churchill River in Saskatchewan , who is Metis , and the rest of the New Democratic caucus when I call upon the government to correct horrible historic injustices .
now is the time to officially exonerate Louis Riel and with it the dark cloud that hangs over the federal government .
now is the time to go beyond recognizing Riel as a founder of Manitoba and officially recognize him as a Father of Confederation .
the refusal of the federal government to acknowledge that the Metis fall under subsection 91 ( 24 ) of the constitution is one of the worst forms of official federal discrimination according to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples .
the anniversary of the death of Louis Riel would be a very fitting time to correct these injustices .
* * *
regional DEVELOPMENT
Mr. Claude Drouin ( Beauce , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to repeat in this House a piece of excellent news for the great Qu 茅 bec - Chaudi 猫 re - Appalaches region .
on November 7 , the hon. secretary of state responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development gave a highly positive report on the regional technology fund .
after a mere year of existence , thanks to contributions totalling $ 3.3 million , this fund has made ten high - tech projects possible .
these projects , in which close to $ 17 million will be invested , will create 187 jobs in the greater Qu 茅 bec - Chaudi 猫 re - Appalaches region .
this initiative , undertaken by the government in partnership with Gatiq - Technor 茅 gion , will help make this region a centre of excellence for the companies involved in the new economy .
this is once again proof of the important role played by the Canadian government , via FORDQ and its secretary of state .
* * *
international DEVELOPMENT
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to congratulate the University of New Brunswick , Saint John campus , for acquiring the support of CIDA for a major international project .
through community oriented field training activities the project will develop institutional expertise in ecosystem health and conservation management and enhance linkages between the two countries .
this is the third international development project the university has received funding for .
with the help of CIDA and the leadership of Dr. Rick Meiner , vice - president of UNBSJ , our university is emerging as the leader in the maritimes in the field of international development .
i say congratulations to UNBSJ and good luck with its new project .

peacekeeping
Mr. John Richardson ( Perth - Middlesex , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is with great pleasure that I rise in the House today to pay tribute to our peacekeepers in Bosnia .
i had the opportunity to visit some of our peacekeepers last week where I saw first hand their efforts to keep peace in that unfortunate country , enabling its people to rebuild their lives after years of war .
i observed significant progress in making it safer by ridding the country of the scourge of land mines .
i met with pilots and the support staff of the CF - 18 squadron based at Aviano , Italy , whose task was to enforce the no fly zone over Bosnia .
i had the pleasure once again of meeting them as they return today after doing a job well done in Bosnia .
the peacekeepers in Bosnia are fine examples of dedicated , courageous professionals of the Canadian forces who have placed themselves at risk to help nations and peoples to find peaceful solutions to their disagreements .
i am proud of these men and women , as are all Canadians .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
foreign AFFAIRS
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , while our two great allies , Britain and the U.S. , are mobilizing warships this Prime Minister is mobilizing cocktail receptions with Iraqi officials .
last week our Prime Minister was actually defending Canadian business invitations to Saddam .
he said " If you want to sell you have to have contact first '' .
contact ?
who wants contact with a man who gassed thousands of Kurdish dissidents with chemical weapons ?
what kind of contact with the butcher of Bagdhad would the government find acceptable ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government finds completely unacceptable the conduct of Saddam Hussein and his regime .
we insist that the Iraqi regime allow the UN inspectors back , including those of American origin , to carry out their job pursuant to the UN resolutions without reservation .
in so far as there is any matter of exports to Iraq , the government ' s position , as is the Prime Minister ' s position , is that these must meet completely Canadian law and UN resolutions .
how can the Reform Party object to that ?
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Reform Party objects to that because it completely sends the wrong signal to our allies .
that is what we are talking about right now .
any business deal with Iraq , even under the name of so - called non - military business , undermines any allied action .
the UN weapons inspectors must have full access in Iraq and Saddam ' s bullying must end , but our government is actually helping Saddam ' s image and harming our allied cause .
again , why on earth is the Prime Minister supporting trade with the likes of Saddam Hussein ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister is not supporting trade .
all he said was that our rules and the UN rules have to be respected .
i do not see why the Reform Party would oppose that .
furthermore , if the Reform Party is saying that the UN inspectors must be allowed in , all it is doing is agreeing with what we have already said , and it is about time .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is unbelievable .
in defiance of UN sanctions , Saddam continues to develop chemical and biological weapons , nuclear weapons and missile technology .
yet the government says that it is okay , that it does not have a problem with that .
our Prime Minister said that these acceptable trade items are okay because they are okay with the UN .
let us talk about trucks and medical supplies .
they can be used for military purposes and military personnel as well .
our government knows it ; Saddam Hussein knows it .
is there no dictator too dirty for the government to do business with ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member completely misstates the government ' s position .
the government has never said that it supports Iraq ' s development of biological weapons .
it totally rejects that .
it stands firm with the other countries of the UN in saying that Iraq must back down and accept UN inspection without reservation .
i say to the hon. member that type of misleading comment , perhaps not intentional , totally weakens the ability of this Parliament to send a strong signal to Saddam Hussein that his misdeeds are unacceptable .
it is about time that she supported our position against Saddam Hussein .
* * *
airbus
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Liberal government desperately wants the Airbus scandal to go away but is unable to sweep it under the rug .
yesterday former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney accused the government of a high level cover - up .
in the face of this very serious accusation , will the Prime Minister stand and state today unequivocally that former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is lying ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have more respect for Parliament and the institution of prime minister than to use the language suggested by the hon. member .
i do want to say that the minutes of settlement signed on behalf of Brian Mulroney say that the parties accept that the RCMP , on its own , initiated the Airbus investigation .
the parties have always acknowledged that the RCMP must continue investigating any allegations of illegality or wrongdoing brought to its attention .
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Crowfoot .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , everyone from the prime minister to the former justice minister to the commissioner of the RCMP has told Canadians that Staff Sergeant Fiegenwald is the only individual responsible for the Airbus scandal .
yet they allowed him to walk away without a hearing and without the determination of guilt .
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , there is no cover - up here .
the arrangement between Mr. Fiegenwald and the RCMP was , as far as I am aware , entered into voluntarily by Mr. Fiegenwald with the RCMP .
that is something involving the internal disciplinary process of the RCMP under the RCMP Act .
as far as I am aware , ministers have no role in that process .
* * *
IRAQ
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , over the past few days , a potential conflict has been growing in the Persian Gulf between Iraq and the international community .
the Prime Minister said in Hanoi last week on this matter that he was not ruling out support for the American option , that is , armed intervention .
could the Deputy Prime Minister clarify the remarks of the Prime Minister and tell us clearly the government ' s position on the growing conflict between Iraq and the United States ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , according to my information , the conflict is between Iraq and all of the UN countries , including Canada .
we totally oppose Iraq ' s position , and demand that Iraq again allow United Nations ' inspectors into the country to do their work .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
but I would like the Deputy Prime Minister to tell us whether he agrees with the more radical approach of armed intervention advocated by the United States or supports finding a peaceful solution , such as increased economic sanctions against Iraq ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , at this point , according to my sources , the issue of an armed intervention is hypothetical .
we have joined with the other UN countries in demanding that Iraq allow the inspectors back into the country to carry out their work according to the UN resolutions .
* * *
canada POST
Mr. R 茅 jean Lefebvre ( Champlain , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Labour .
last Thursday , the Postal Workers Union presented Canada Post with a new offer in which they reduced their wage claims .
in response , Canada Post representatives left the bargaining table .
could the Minister of Labour remind Canada Post that such actions are in no one ' s interest and that they must return immediately to the bargaining table to come to an agreement with the union ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I can assure my hon. colleague that is exactly what we do want , a collective agreement .
we want both sides to go back to the table , as I understand they are now at the table .
i encourage them to work together for a collective agreement that will be better for Canada Post , CUPW and the people of Canada .
Mr. R 茅 jean Lefebvre ( Champlain , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to remind the Minister that the same bargaining agents were there in 1995 and that an agreement was reached .
in 1995 , a negotiated agreement was signed .
why are Canada Post representatives leaving the bargaining table this time around when an agreement is still possible ?
is it because they are sure that the government will intervene and legislate them back to work ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as I indicated , we have used every process possible in order to make sure that we would come up with a collective agreement .
this government wants an agreement that will be better for the post office , for the union and for the people of Canada .
* * *
the ENVIRONMENT
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of the Environment .
Canadians have watched this federal Liberal government shift its ground again and again on greenhouse gas emissions .
now we finally know where the prime minister stands , peering out from behind Bill Clinton .
the government ' s latest Kyoto position is not good enough .
it is not good enough for the Canadians who have written letters and petitions and it is not good enough for the future of the planet .
my question to the Minister of the Environment is simple .
is this pathetic Kyoto position good enough for her ?
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , at this point the federal government has not announced targets and time lines because we are playing a very important role in Canada and internationally to bring together parties so that we can achieve a success in Kyoto .
as a matter of fact , we have worked as no other government before has worked with all parties , all partners , provinces , territories , business and municipalities to try to come to a consensus about what our Canadian position should be .
we had significant success at our meeting with environment and energy ministers in Regina last week .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , it does not take an atmospheric researcher to know the difference between a 13 % increase and a 20 % decrease in greenhouse gas emissions .
it is this Liberal government that has failed to live up to the Rio agreement .
it is this Liberal government that has failed to live up to its own red book promise and now it cannot even live up to the commitment made by the prime minister less than a month ago .
is that good enough for this energy minister ?
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this government is committed to a successful agreement in Kyoto in order to reduce greenhouse gasses .
the environment and the issue of climate change are extremely important to the government and we are working nationally and internationally to have a good agreement .
there are other parties in this country who have not contributed in a positive way to make sure that we deal with the fundamental problem of climate change in Canada and around the world .

canada PENSION PLAN
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , we have been told by the office of the information commissioner that Bill C - 2 , the legislation setting up the Canada pension plan investment board , does not subject the board to the Access to Information Act .
i would like to know from the Minister of Finance whether this is an oversight in the legislation or whether this is a deliberate decision taken from the government to avoid the board ' s having to put up with the scrutiny of the Canadian public .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate the leader of the Conservative Party for having raised this issue which was discussed in the House almost a month ago .
the fact is the CPP investment board will operate as any other pension fund .
it will be totally transparent , reports will be made on a regular basis .
as the hon. member knows , certain of its deliberations will be in secret .
obviously there will be confidential matters and because we want it to operate as regular pension fund -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Sherbrooke .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate the minister for his answer today .
however , I am sorry to say that it is as bad today as it was a month ago .
i would like to follow up with another question about the way this board will operate and ask him why the Auditor General of Canada is not going to examine the board ' s operation and make a value judgment .
why is it that the auditor general will not report on this board ' s operations to the House of Commons ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is a board which is set up by the federal and provincial governments .
in fact , there is joint stewardship .
it is going to be independently operated in the same way that any other pension plan would be .
it will invest in order to earn the highest returns , but it will be totally transparent .
all its operations will be available for public scrutiny .
i really think that what the hon. member ought to do is join with the vast majority of Canadians and congratulate the government on what is a very innovative position .
* * *
airbus
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , let us get this straight .
when it comes to Airbus Canadians are suppose to believe from the government that Brian Mulroney was lying and that a lowly sergeant in the RCMP is responsible for this entire Airbus fiasco .
will the government please clarify its position once again on this matter ?
is it a lowly sergeant who is responsible or is this government responsible for the Airbus fiasco ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I do not accept the premise of the hon. member ' s question .
the use of the word lying is not one with which we associate ourselves in the context of the question .
there is no cover - up .
Brian Mulroney himself in the minutes of settlement ending the litigation said that the subject of the litigation was not Sergeant Fiegenwald but the request for assistance that was sent to the Swiss .
he further said that the parties have always acknowledged that the RCMP must continue investigating any allegations of illegality or wrongdoing brought to its attention .
these are the words -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Okanagan - Coquihalla .
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am sure the minister will be happy to table those documents in the House .
again , let us get this straight .
the government has spent about a million dollars on Brian Mulroney ' s legal costs .
there is another $ 2 million for the lawsuit .
now there has been another $ 35 million lawsuit launched by Karlheinz Schreibner .
how much more are Canadian taxpayers going to have to pay for this Liberal cover - up ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I reject the premise of the hon. member ' s question .
there is no cover - up .
if the hon. member had his way the Canadian taxpayer would have paid Brian Mulroney $ 50 million .
because of our negotiations that claim was dropped and that money saved to the Canadian taxpayer .
* * *
the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Environment .
ever since the Canadian position on greenhouse gases has been raised , the government has repeatedly accused the Reform Party of disregarding environmental matters and of lacking the courage to take a stand on such matters .
after the meeting in Regina , does the federal government realize that it has assumed the Reform Party ' s position , based on the lowest common denominator ?
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
they gave us the flexibility as an international negotiator to work with the international community for success in Kyoto .
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , considering the weakness of the federal government ' s position , did the minister at least obtain assurances from the provinces that they will accept to ratify the agreement that will be reached in Kyoto ?
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have to repeat that what came out of our meeting Regina last week was not a definitive position of the federal government with regard to the meeting in Kyoto .
we did agree with our provincial environment and energy counterparts to flexible ideas of what targets we might put in place .
however , the provinces recognize the important and significant role that the Government of Canada plays in negotiating international agreements .
* * *
canada PENSION PLAN
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Association of Canadian Pension Management released a report today on Canada ' s retirement income system .
its report states that the current system is fundamentally unfair to future generations .
why is the finance minister so willing to sacrifice the best interests of our children to paper over the cracks of his CPP pyramid scheme ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , over 75 % of Canadians support the Canada pension plan .
the basic difference of opinion that has existed between ourselves and the Reformers has to do with the unfunded liability .
i would like to simply tell her that it would require a 25 % increase in personal income tax to pay for that unfunded liability .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is probably because of the finance minister ' s continued bogus numbers that the Association of Canadian Pension Management recommended today that education about pensions should start in high school .
of course , this means that our kids would be sure to find out that their return on a lifetime CPP investment will be less than 2 % .
is not the finance minister in such a hurry to push through this CPP tax grab just so Canadians -
the Speaker :
the hon. Minister of Finance .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , if you want to know the definition of a tax grab it is the 25 % personal income tax increase recommended by the Reform Party or it is the doubling of the GST recommended by the Reform Party as a means of paying the unfunded liability .
that is the basic difference between the Reform Party and us , and we are not prepared to engage in a smash and grab tax program like the Reform Party .
* * *
CALGARY DECLARATION
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs .
it is becoming obvious that the increasing dislike the Reformers are showing for the Calgary declaration makes its acceptance very unlikely .
what is the government ' s reaction to the fact that overall support for the Calgary declaration seems to be dissolving into thin air , especially since the Prime Minister had promoted the leader of the official opposition as a key player in this issue ?
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I believe this is wishful thinking on the part of the member .
basically , the Calgary declaration reflects great Canadian values , a profound respect for diversity and support for equality .
except for the separatist party , all parties in this House have agreed to it .
it has support from across the country , and what the member has just said about wishing there were none is even more reason for supporting it .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , if I were him I would not be so quick to rejoice at Reform ' s support .
does he not realize that the statement made in Calgary by the provincial premiers is d 茅 j 脿 vu , in other words what is definitely not enough for Quebec is quickly becoming too much for the rest of Canada ?
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , what is definitely not enough for Quebec is this narrow minded plan to split Quebec from Canada .
Quebeckers want to stay in Canada and they are quite right .

the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. David Chatters ( Athabasca , Ref. ) :
if the government takes it seriously why are we the only country in the G - 7 that has yet to announce a position going into Kyoto ?
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this government would love the Reform Party to announce its position about whether or not it considers this to be a serious issue .
so far we hear nothing but scaremongering , fear , denial .
what does this party represent ?
we had a successful meeting in Regina with environment and energy ministers from all provinces and all territories who agreed that this is a serious issue and wanted the federal government to negotiate an international success for Kyoto .
we are working with all partners in this country toward implementing a strategy that will reduce emissions .
Mr. David Chatters ( Athabasca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , our position is not important .
you are the government .
it is your position .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
Mr. David Chatters :
Mr. Speaker , if you in fact have consulted and made progress -
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
the Speaker :
put your question please .
Mr. David Chatters :
Mr. Speaker , this is an outrage .
if you have made progress in Regina , if you have business on side , why in the world can you not announce the government ' s position going to Kyoto ?
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we suddenly do have an issue upon which we can agree : that the opinion of the Reform Party does not matter .
our Canadian partners recognize the importance of Canada playing a role to make sure that we have a success in Kyoto .
therefore , we have to negotiate in the international forum to make sure we have a success in Kyoto .
other parties in this country , provinces , territories and municipalities recognize the important role that -
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I do not know why Reformers and Liberals argue with each other .
they have the same position , the same reduced Kyoto position .
the federal government drastically reduced its social transfer payments to the provinces .
for each dollar cut from federal expenditures between 1994 and 1998 , 54 cents , or more than half , where taken out of social transfers to the provinces , that is to say out of the health , education and social assistance budgets .
now that he knows for sure that the budget will be balanced this year , does the Minister of Finance intend to return to the provinces at least part of what he stole from them instead of taking this money -
the Speaker :
the Hon. Minister of Finance .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member knows full well that these figures are wrong .
tax points must also be taken into consideration .
that being said , the Prime Minister himself answered the hon. member last June when he increased transfers to the provinces by $ 6 billion over five years .

OAS FIREARMS CONVENTION
Ms. Colleen Beaumier ( Brampton West - Mississauga , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , on Friday , November 14 in Washington , Canada signed the OAS firearms convention .
can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs tell me how this agreement will help to control the international trade in arms ?
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this OAS convention addresses longstanding concerns about the free flow of illicit firearms , ammunition and explosives in this hemisphere .
the convention will reduce the illicit trafficking of firearms , ammunition and explosives across our borders .
it will assist our police and law enforcement officials in the fight against violent crime , illegal drugs and terrorism in Canada and in the United States .

prisons
Mr. Chuck Cadman ( Surrey North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , this past weekend a supervisor at Milton ' s Maplehurst jail condemned the prison system as being rife with illegal drugs .
he said that inmates have easy access to " heroin , cocaine , crack , marijuana , hash , hash oil , Valium , pills and steroids '' .
all our government appears to be doing is providing bleach to clean needles to reduce the risk of HIV .
will the solicitor general please explain to Canadians why he will not or why he cannot eliminate illegal drugs from our prisons ?
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , first of all I would remind the hon. member that the jail in question is provincial .
secondly , since we introduced urine analysis in the penitentiary system the incidents of drug usage have diminished from 39 % to 12 % .
Mr. Chuck Cadman ( Surrey North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , drugs have been a problem in every jail and prison across this country for years .
in Mountain federal prison in my province of British Columbia , significant quantities of heroin , marijuana , cocaine and prescription drugs were reported smuggled in over a 46 day period in 1996 .
i ask the solicitor general to please tell Canadians how , with crime this rampant inside our penitentiaries , they can be expected to feel safe in their own communities .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I can only repeat the fact that the correctional service has taken action very successfully over the last two years .

canada POST
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , according to a leaked memo by the President of the Canadian Direct Marketing Association last August , the Minister of Public Works indicated to the CDMA that a national postal stoppage would be very short and back to work legislation would be quickly introduced .
my question for the minister is what will the position of the government be if Canada Post locks out its CUPW employees this evening ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have indicated previously what the government supports and what the government wants is a collective agreement .
we urge both sides to get back to the table and I understand they are .
if we have an agreement it is much better for CUPW , the post office and for the people of Canada .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the threat of back to work legislation is the reason the parties are no longer talking .
we are in this fix because the government refuses to confirm or deny that it is going to introduce back to work legislation .
for the sake of all Canadians , will the minister withdraw the threat of back to work legislation and allow the union and management to sit down and seriously negotiate the collective agreement that he seriously talks about ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , that is what I have indicated .
that is what the government wants .
i am not going to speculate on what might happen or what is going to happen .
the parties , I understand , are meeting today .
what we want is a collective agreement .
i urge you to urge your colleagues to sit at the table and come up with an agreement that will be better for the people of Canada .
the Speaker :
my colleagues , I would encourage you to address all of your questions and answers through the Chair .

airbus
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , in light of the millions of dollars and the forced red faced apology of the Liberal government for the mishandling of the Airbus affair , will the Deputy Prime Minister , in keeping with his promise and his government ' s promise of accountability and openness , tell this House who exactly is responsible for this debacle and what does it plan to do short of waiting for the lawsuits to roll in and then say it is saving us millions of dollars ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I think that my hon. friend should read Brian Mulroney ' s explanation .
he signed it , he knows what is going on .
therefore , I think you ought to take what he says in the signed minutes of settlement seriously .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my supplementary .
you ask a simple question , you get a convoluted answer .
can the Deputy Prime Minister tell us in a straightforward way who is responsible , who is at the bottom of this and , speaking of letters , when is the government going to withdraw the accusation it made and sent to the Swiss authorities ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in the minutes of settlement signed on behalf of Brian Mulroney he says " the parties acknowledge that the procedure used in sending the request for assistance to the Swiss in this case was the same as that which was followed in numerous previous requests for mutual assistance under both the current and previous administrations '' .
i think my hon. friend ought to study these minutes of settlement .
it will help him in phrasing his questions in future .

technologies PARTNERSHIPS CANADA
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Technologies Partnerships Canada or TPC is a vehicle for our government to invest in Canada ' s high technology industries .
firms in my riding have praised TPC and have urged me to support additional funding for this program .
can the Minister of Industry please explain to this House how TPC benefits Canada or is it just another handout to business ?
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , TPC is anything but a handout .
it is a risk sharing investment that the government makes to support the development of new technology and products that are sold and exported throughout the world .
so far , the $ 491 million that the Government of Canada has committed in TPC investments has leveraged $ 2.17 billion in private sector investments , generating up to $ 52 billion in sales of Canadian goods and has created or maintained over 11,500 jobs in the Canadian economy .

Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , when the federal Treasury Board writes a paper called " Getting Science Right in the Public Sector '' , one can only assume something is wrong .
it is this .
we know that Liberals ignore Canadian fishermen .
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , if the hon. member wished , he could look at the decisions for the fisheries department since I became minister .
they are in full conformity with the fisheries research board .
we have followed science in all the decisions made .
in a large department with many scientists there will inevitably be divisions between scientists but the practice of using science to guide management decisions is well established .
it is there and the hon. member has only to look at it to find out that it is -

immigration
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration .
according to a report presented to the minister on October 2 , there are currently some 270 refugee claimants in Canada who have been declared war criminals by the Immigration and Refugee Board .
the same report states that the government has been much too permissive in this respect .
what action has the minister taken so far to ensure that Canada does not become a haven for war criminals ?
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is referring to an internal report produced by one of our immigration officers working in the war crimes division .
this is one of the actions we have taken .
several cases were investigated .
more than 70 claimants were returned to their country of origin and more than 270 -

agriculture
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister of agriculture .
the minister will know that B.C. farmers have been hurt by extremely poor harvest conditions about the Okanagan and the Peace River districts this year .
the B.C. government wants to help out the area farmers affected by this disaster by developing cost shared responses to these huge crop losses , losses which far exceed existing crop insurance and NISA programs .
why will the federal government not do its share and help out B . C farmers ?
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) :
we have discussed the way in which the NISA program and the crop insurance programs , which are ongoing programs , available to farmers across Canada can assist .

canada POST
Mr. Jean Dub 茅 ( Madawaska - Restigouche , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Labour has known for two and a half weeks that Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers would be in a position for a strike or lockout this week .
a work stoppage at Canada Post will hurt thousands of Canadian charities and businesses at their busiest time of the season .
does the Minister of Labour intend to introduce pre - emptive back to work legislation today or does he have his heart set on shutting down Canada Post for Christmas ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wish my hon. colleague would concentrate on what is happening and not on what might happen or what will happen .
i understand the parties have met today .
this government wants a collective agreement .

trade
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , U.S. President Bill Clinton recently failed to get backing from Congress to give him fast track authority to negotiate expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement .
my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for International Trade .
is Canada now in a position to move forward and have its own trade deals with Latin American countries ?
if so , does he plan to do this ?
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for his question .
it shows great insight into this issue .
canada does not intend to allow a U.S. delay in the fast tracking process to interfere with Canada ' s own progress in this matter .
there is a tremendous growth in the region with a population of over 500 million people and a gross domestic product of over $ 2 trillion .
we are pursuing it with vigour .

fisheries
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Saint John River in New Brunswick has a catch and release sports fishery for conservation reasons .
recently the DFO closed the river to catch and release fishing and then proceeded to kill fish to give to the local aboriginal communities .
the local native communities never asked for those fish .
they are not surplus fish and they are not necessary for science .
why did the DFO close the river for conservation reasons and then proceed to kill fish ?
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is obviously unaware that the 22 fish that he is talking about were in fact male hatchery grilse that had been at sea for one winter only .
they were turned over to the aboriginal community which is appropriate because the aboriginal community ' s quota for ceremonial and food purposes had not been met .
these were hatchery fish and it is important for genetic reasons , to protect genetic stocks of salmon to make sure that the number of hatchery fish are reduced .
in addition , in that very river the number of male fish was double the number of female and that is an imbalance that we wanted to correct .

INDIAN AFFAIRS
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development .
recently , several people have condemned the tragic story of native boarding schools set up to destroy their culture .
these boarding schools nearly wiped out a generation of natives in Canada .
do the minister and her government recognize the federal goverment ' s responsibility in this human tragedy ?
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I missed the first part of the question that dealt with a specific case , but I can assure my colleague that we take very seriously our responsibilities with regard to the rights of Canadian natives .
we hope to have the response to the RCAP report by the end of this year .

canada POST
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canada Post continues to try to negotiate through the media using fearmongering and misinformation to hide the real issues surrounding this round of bargaining .
those real issues are the protection of thousands of good full time jobs and the struggle to make poor paying part - time jobs into real jobs that Canadians can live on .
this round of bargaining could be settled if the government would stop threatening to throw 4,000 Canadians out on the street .
will the Minister of Public Works speak out on behalf of Canadian workers and direct Canada Post to withdraw its proposals which would eliminate Canadian jobs ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , let me say that first of all while Canada Post loses money because of the strike threats , Canadian postal workers risk losing their jobs .
i want to remind the hon. member that it was Canada Post that last week called the president of the union to say " Let ' s go back to the table and start negotiating '' .
that is what they are doing today .
they continue to negotiate .
if he has any say with his friends in the union , maybe he should talk them into staying at the table and coming up with a reasonable proposal so that we can have a settlement agreement .

it was asked in the House .
i am going to give the minister one kick at the can .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :

it is not the decision of any Liberal to want to arbitrate between the Tories and the Reform .

national HIGHWAY SYSTEM
Ms. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have several petitioners who urge the federal government to join with the provincial governments to make the national highway system upgrading possible beginning in 1997 .
taxation
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have two petitions today .
the first petition has to do with the family .
the petitioners draw to the attention of the House that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its value to our society .
they also state that the Income Tax Act does not take into account the real cost of raising children .
the petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue tax initiatives for those families that choose to provide direct parental care in the home .
alcohol CONSUMPTION
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
the second petition , Mr. Speaker , has to do with the misuse of alcohol .
the petitioners draw to the attention of the House that the consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems and particularly that fetal alcohol syndrome and other alcohol related birth defects are preventable by avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy .
the petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to mandate the labelling of alcoholic products to warn expectant mothers and others of the risks associated with alcohol consumption .

point OF ORDER
question PERIOD
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am probably out of sequence time wise on this , but during question period the Deputy Prime Minister referred to and read from a document .
i believe under the standing orders he is required to table that document .
we request that he do so .
the Deputy Speaker :
if the Deputy Prime Minister read from a document in the House , being an experienced member , I am sure he would know that there would be a requirement to table it .
i am sure the request will be drawn to the attention of the Deputy Prime Minister and if a tabling is to follow I suspect that he will return to the House and table the document .
given the hour and the fact that question period has been over for a few minutes , perhaps it would be appropriate to deal with this at a later time if a tabling does not follow .
government ORDERS
amendment TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA ( QUEBEC )
the House resumed consideration of the motion .
the Deputy Speaker :
the hon. member for Calgary Southeast had the floor and I should advise the hon. member that he has 14 minutes remaining in his participation in this debate .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , before question period in addressing the proposed amendment to section 93 of the British North America Act I was discussing the lack of consensus that exists in Quebec , in particular among the groups most directly affected .
i want to reiterate for the record that prior to tabling this resolution in the national assembly the Quebec government held no hearings on the amendment .
parents , school boards and others were not able to present their positions to the national assembly on the amendment .
the assembly voted on the matter under party discipline rather than under a free vote and had no clear evidence in favour of a consensus .
instead , the Government of Quebec passed a resolution stipulating that the federal government should amend the constitution with undue haste which was rushed through the joint committee in about two weeks time for an amendment that will forever extinguish minority rights .
i think undue haste is the operative term .
yet the parliamentary special joint committee heard from groups representing hundreds of thousands of Quebeckers objecting to the amendment over the course of our two weeks of hearings .
for example , la Coalition pour la confessionnalit 茅 scolaire collected 235,000 signatures of Quebec citizens who opposed the amendment .
these groups testified that the possibility of this constitutional amendment had never been discussed with them .
they questioned why the Quebec government would abolish the rights of religious minorities when this was unnecessary to establish linguistic school boards , a point defined as such by the Supreme Court of Canada in a 1993 reference .
it is a longstanding convention not only in Canada but in other liberal democracies that acquired rights cannot be abrogated without the consent of those affected , and that consent does not demonstrably exist in this case .
parliament therefore has a responsibility to ensure the democratic consent includes a demonstrated assent of the minority .
as indicated by the Protestant communities in Quebec , for instance , who were most vocal in their opposition to the amendment , there is a demonstrated dissent or disagreement of the minority groups most directly affected .
as a minority within a minority , the French Protestant community will suffer the most from the negative effects of this amendment .
it will be amalgamated with the majority of francophone schools , but those wishing Protestant education may be lumped into the few Protestant schools permitted under the new system , most of which will be English speaking .
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs justifies the proposed amendment by stating that it will improve the situation of Quebec ' s anglophone community .
he says essentially that the linguistic educational rights of that community will continue to be protected under section 23 of the charter .
the minister knows that the Quebec government has failed to apply subsection 23 ( 1 ) ( a ) , which is the only real protection the charter affords linguistic education .
it is insufficient protection for the anglophone community and hardly justifies removing rights from the Protestant and Catholic communities .
let me move on to the question of whether this is in the national interest and whether or not it prejudicially affects minority rights .
the amendment will replace constitutional guarantees with inferior statutory guarantees .
this is because precedents exist in law such as the Canadian Civil Liberties Association v Minister of Education decision where the Ontario Court of Appeal addressed the issue of indoctrinational education .
the case established that religious curricula denominational in nature could not be endorsed by the provincial ministry of education or be created by school boards because to do so would be to offend sections 2 and 15 of the charter .
in Zylberberg v Sudbury Board of Education , a 1988 case , the supreme court ruled that opening or morning exercises in religious observances in public schools were not permitted under the charter for the same reasons .
the legal precedents these two rulings provide will impact on the decision making of Quebec courts .
they are bound to these precedents , as is the Supreme Court of Canada .
it is unlikely , in fact inconceivable , that a Quebec court would not find in a way consistent with the precedents which threaten confessional education .
this is a very important point .
with all due respect I do not think some of the members who have spoken to the resolution and sat in committee fully appreciate the threat it poses .
essentially when we take away the protection afforded by section 93 the charter in toto it applies to the Quebec education system .
the judicial precedents are quite clear .
the charter does not tolerate sectarian confessional education in the school system .
provisions for that kind of education allowed for in the Quebec education act and Bill 107 which is now Bill 109 will eventually be nullified as being inconsistent with the charter by the courts .
the Quebec government said this would not happen because the Quebec education act is protected from the secularizing effect of the charter by its invocation of the notwithstanding clause .
when the public consensus in Quebec begins to change with respect to the right of confessional education , there is no doubt a future Quebec legislature will fail to invoke the coverage of section 33 and the confessional education provisions in the Quebec education act will be found null and void by the courts .
this is very troubling .
Canadian constitutional history is premised on building minority rights and not on repealing them .
Peter Hogg , Canada ' s renowned constitutional scholar , has described section 93 as " a small bill of rights for the protection of minority religious groups '' .
in its reference decision in 1993 on Bill 107 the Supreme Court of Canada declared that section 93 is the " basic compact of confederation '' .
never in Canadian constitutional history has an amendment to eliminate constitutionally protected minority rights been passed .
with the passage of the amendment to section 93 , freedom of religion will become freedom from religious education eventually in Quebec .
the concern is this will be a precedent that will be established for Ontario , Alberta , Saskatchewan and other provinces that rely on the protection of section 93 for minority sectarian education .
it is an illusion that parents will have the opportunity to choose the religious education they desire for their children when a single decision by the courts will easily render the provision of public denominational schools unconstitutional .
this seems to be the desire of the Quebec government which no longer wishes to fund religious education in public schools .
at least that is a position one can draw from some public comments of the Quebec minister of education .
that is what the constitutional experts said before the committee .
minister Marois and Minister Brassard , the Quebec ministers of education and intergovernmental affairs , appeared before the committee .
on questioning they refused to provide any guarantee that the confessional elements of the Quebec education act would be preserved by invoking the section 33 notwithstanding protection .
they cannot provide that assurance because we do not know what future legislatures will do .
i do not accept that legislative guarantees of access to religious instruction in secular schools are of comparable quality to the guarantees under the constitution .
previously the Leader of the Opposition stated in debate :
- this interest in the religious orientation in the education of children is broader and deeper than the mere provision of non - denominational religious courses in secular schools and the permitting of religious observances supervised by a secular authority .
it includes the right to have those courses and observance provided in an environment that truly reflects spiritual values .
it is this broader right that many parents would like to see safeguarded .
that right was safeguarded at confederation which is imperilled by the amendment today .
confessional education teaches a way of life , not merely a history of a religion .
religious instruction provided in secular schools cannot approximate the experience of religious education in confessional schools .
abrogation of section 93 will prevent future generations of Catholic and Protestant citizens in Quebec , and potentially in other provinces , from studying and adopting that way of life .
this creates a worrisome precedent for other provinces such as Ontario .
it is a political precedent , not a legal one , for the extinguishment of minority rights which other provinces will no doubt take up .
we will be studying a similar application from Newfoundland this week at a joint committee .
i reiterate one very important point .
some people have suggested that in a modern pluralistic society it is no longer appropriate to provide denominational publicly funded education to particular sectarian groups .
that is a sentiment I can understand , but we do not serve pluralism or minority rights by extinguishing rights that exist for some groups .
if we object to the exclusive coverage of section 93 to Catholics and Protestants , instead of extinguishing the section we ought to broaden it so that it includes all groups of all religious backgrounds .
then they would all have access to the same rights .
a modern , liberal , pluralistic democracy ought to stand for the expansion of rights , not their diminishment .
we do not equalize the playing field by levelling rights for some .
we build a real democracy respectful of human rights by expanding them for all .
parliament should return this application to the Quebec government and propose that it come back to this place with an amendment to section 93 , which would broaden the confessional guarantees which the Fathers of Confederation in their wisdom decided to pass on to us through the generations .
some will say that the compact of confederation , the small bill of rights which is section 93 , was merely a political arrangement designed for a particular time in the mid - 19 th century and no longer applicable .
it was just the result of horse trading between Catholics and Protestants in Ontario and Quebec respectively .
i disagree .
section 93 does not state explicitly but implicitly speaks to a fundamental right recognized by all liberal democracies , the right to publicly funded and publicly supported education .
it is a critical social right that can only be exercised legitimately at the direction of parents .
it was not a political compromise for one time in our history .
it was the recognition of a fundamental right which it is our duty today and forever to protect and maintain , not to diminish and extinguish .
i call on my colleagues on both sides of the House to think very seriously and soberly about the issue .
we should not let the politics of separatism lead us to the diminishment of a fundamental right and the protection of a minority group in Canada .
Mr. Nick Discepola ( Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I sat on the committee with the hon. member for almost three weeks .
there is a premise that no consensus has been established in Quebec .
i listened very intently to the member ' s speech .
he failed to mention that debate on the creation of linguistic school boards has been ongoing in Quebec upward of 30 years .
he also failed to mention there is a quasi - unanimity on the creation of linguistic school boards .
the role our committee undertook was to determine the appropriateness of the Quebec request under section 93 and the bilateral amending formula for section 43 .
it behoves me to hear the Reform Party time and time again refuse categorically to accept the fact that there is a consensus .
the consensus is large .
other than , as the Reform has always called for , holding another referendum on the issue I do not see how Reformers can ignore it .
i have a duty as a member of Parliament to make sure there is a consensus among the minority that is affected .
let us be clear what we are talking about .
we are talking about removing the application of articles 1 through 4 in section 93 in Quebec .
i will be even more specific .
we talk about consensus .
the provincial Protestant Association of Teachers represents approximately 6,500 teachers .
the non - denominationals came to us and said they were in favour .
la F 茅 d 茅 ration des comit 茅 s des parents de la province de Qu 茅 bec is made up of over 40,000 parents , French and English speaking , Catholic and Protestant .
it represents 172 parents ' committees .
la Centrale de l ' enseignement du Qu 茅 bec , the largest group of 130,000 members , and la Coalition pour la d 茅 confessionalisation du syst 猫 me scolaire - I can cite survey after survey - all called on the government to acquiesce to Quebec ' s demands because that province in its infinite wisdom sought for almost 30 years to find a solution to modernizing the school system .
i ask the hon. member , is it appropriate in a modern society such as Canada today to provide for the constitutional protection of just two classes of religions , Protestants and Catholics , or should we not let each province decide what is best , in its own interests , in its own regions and in its own communities ?
Mr. Jason Kenney :
Mr. Speaker , first of all I made it very clear at the outset of my remarks , as did the Reform Party , in its dissenting opinion that we recognize there is virtually unanimous consensus in Quebec for the creation of linguistic school boards .
i said that half a dozen times in my speech .
i agreed to that statement being included in the majority report .
however , that has nothing to do with section 93 .
this is , frankly , the unintentional duplicity of the proponents of this amendment failing to recognize that linguistic school boards is one question and section 93 is an entirely different question .
does the hon. member opposite not recognize that in 1993 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in a reference from the Quebec government that then Bill 107 , substantially the same as Bill 109 , the now Quebec education act which established linguistic school boards , was completely consistent with the protections afforded by section 93 .
in fact , the Quebec government is already establishing these linguistic school boards .
witnesses from Alliance Quebec , from Catholic groups , from Protestant groups who appeared before us said that they do not object to linguistic school boards .
the government is implementing them .
why can we not maintain the protections afforded by section 93 given to us by our ancestors and , at the same time , modernize the school system by consolidating linguistic groups into linguistic boards ?
that is the challenge that this government has not answered .
it is possible to do both .
given a choice , this Parliament ought to opt for protecting minority rights when other policy objectives like the establishment of linguistic school boards can be achieved at the same time .
in response to the member ' s last question , I said at the end of my remarks that I would strongly support , as virtually every group that appeared before the committee in opposition to the amendment would support , an amendment to section 93 which would broaden the constitutional rights guaranteed therein to all denominational and religious groups .
the point is that no minority ' s interests are served , no one ' s rights are protected by removing rights from some people .
instead of crushing section 93 and the rights that exist for the large majority of Quebeckers to access confessional education , why not broaden it so that yes , people of other faiths have a constitutional guarantee to publicly funded religious education that does not depend on the political whim of the legislature at any given moment .
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu 茅 bec , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to rise in this debate because I also was a member of the special joint committee on linguistic school boards .
what the Reform member seems to be saying is that the witnesses who appeared before the committee did not have a good understanding of the issue .
bill 109 on public education also had to do with the repeal of section 93 .
the people who came to testify knew that the creation of linguistic school boards also entailed debating the abrogation of section 93 .
so he should not be saying such things about the witnesses who came to testify in Quebec before the various committees .
people have been talking about this issue for 30 years , and what is at the heart of this debate is the amendment to section 93 .
so I cannot understand why someone would rise and say that people are being tricked .
when Minister Marois came to testify in committee , I asked her the same question , because consensus and consultation were always concerns of the committee .
it was important to ensure that people knew exactly where we were heading with this .
repeal of section 93 is an issue that people have been talking about for 30 years .
a dozen consultations and legal procedures went nowhere or were declared unconstitutional .
so I have difficulty understanding how my colleague from the Reform Party who has just spoken can question all this process that was undertaken in Quebec .
this is the only way to ensure that the Quebec school system is properly managed and can deal with the reality of an English - and a French - speaking people .
also , children should not be penalized by a cumbersome and complicated administrative system .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
Mr. Speaker , there seems to be this impenetrable refusal to listen to what I am saying .
i am not denying the consensus in favour of establishing linguistic school boards .
i literally said that six times in my main remarks .
we make that clear two or three times in our dissenting report .
every witness who opposed the amendment made that clear in their submissions .
however , that debate which has gone on for 30 years is not what we are discussing today .
what this Parliament has been given in section 93 is the responsibility to guarantee confessional education rights .
let me just make it clear for the member .
i said it in French twice and I will now say it in English .
i am in favour of the establishment of linguistic school boards in Quebec .
the Reform Party is in favour of the establishment of linguistic school boards in Quebec .
there is unanimous consensus in Quebec to this effect .
the Quebec bishops agree with it .
however , that does not mean we have to extinguish confessional school rights .
this is what the supreme court said in its 1993 reference on bill 107 .
it said we could have both .
we do not have to take away section 93 confessional school rights in order to establish linguistic boards .
we can do both .
the challenge to us again is to let the Quebec government do what it wants , establish those boards but do what the Fathers of Confederation expected us to do in 1867 , and maintain that constitutional protection for those minorities .
we can do both at the same time .
at the same time , why not do it ?
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Brossard - La Prairie , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , although I have spoken several times in this House , this is still my maiden speech .
i would therefore like to take advantage of this opportunity to say a few words about my riding of Brossard - La Prairie .
this is a riding inhabited by some of the old Quebec families whose roots in North America go back to the 16 th century , in Saint - Philippe and La Prairie for instance .
as well , the first railway in Canada was at La Prairie .
this is a riding which includes the municipality of Candiac , a quiet little suburb of Montreal , and the city of Brossard , which is listed year after year as one of the best administered cities in Quebec , and where people from a multitude of backgrounds and cultures co - exist .
the municipal government , community organizations and the people of Brossard as a whole have all made an effort to ensure that we would become a model of togetherness in a world so often torn apart by dogmatic ideologies .
all members of Parliament claim that their riding is the best and the truth of the matter is they are most probably right .
but come and experience our down - home hospitality , come visit our schools , our community centres , come talk to our people , the Vaillancourts , the H 茅 berts , the Delisles , the Savards and Guyots , to our citizens with names like Lam , Tsim , Ho , Kurien , Chhatwal , Singh , Batagan , Villafranca , Koufalis , Pattichis , Mayers , Waide , Lewis and all the rest .
come talk to them , and you will see the harmony that exists among us , and you will understand why I hold such affection for the people of this riding .
all of Canada can be proud of them .
my riding is located on the South Shore of Montreal .
in 1965 English speaking parents , parents of the area with a tremendous vision and sense of future , brought the South Shore Protestant School Board to task .
they wanted their children to learn French using a pilot method developed by McGill University , a method that eventually gained world renown , a method used today by 300,000 young Canadians to learn French .
in 1965 , at the time when there were no language laws in Quebec , these tenacious and foresighted parents put French immersion on the world map .
it was my honour and my pleasure to be a commissioner and the chairman of this local school board in our area .
it is said , and it gives me great pleasure , that I was the first francophone chairman of a Protestant school board in Quebec .
as part of my duties , some 10 years ago I presented a brief to the National Assembly committee on education .
Claude Ryan was the minister at the time .
in the brief , I opposed the proposal for linguistic school boards .
today , I announce my intention to vote in favour of the constitutional amendment before us , and I would like to explain why my position has changed .
i have three examples .
in 1990 , the Supreme Court of Canada , in the matter of Mah 茅 versus Alberta , confirmed the official language minority rights provided in section 23 , as it did as well in 1993 in a reference in Manitoba .
again in 1993 , the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that section 93 protected denominational school boards in Montreal and Quebec City only .
this protection does not apply in my riding .
so , the safeguards provided in section 23 are much greater than those in section 93 .
allow me to deal with certain concerns expressed by Mr. Kamel , who represents the linguistic minority on the South Shore school board , which covers my riding .
i personally know a number of them and they are moderate people .
therefore , I take their concerns all the more seriously .
these parents deplore the fact that minority rights other than those of anglophones or Protestants are not addressed .
i must point out that section 93 does not deal with these other minority rights .
whether section 93 is amended or not , nothing will change in this regard .
in this letter these parents state their fear that linguistic boards could become a tool in the hands of the separatists .
it is a fear that I want to encourage them not to have .
if this fear was founded it would mean that Claude Ryan and Robert Bourassa , the Canadian Jewish Congress , le Rassemblement arabe de Montreal , the Quebec Board of Black Educators , the Provincial Association of Protestant Teachers , the Provincial Association of Catholic Teachers , Alliance Quebec and the Gazette , among so many others , would be separatists simply having in common that they have endorsed the principle of linguistic school boards .
one can see the absurdity of the situation .
the solution is to elect a federalist government in Quebec as soon as possible .
in short , a government with good intentions regarding Quebec ' s place in the Canadian federation could promote Quebec ' s situation within Canada by relying on school structures , whether denominational or linguistic .
similarly , a government with bad intentions can do just the opposite by using the same structures .
another concern expressed by these parents is that the creation of linguistic school boards could adversely impact on an essential element of harmonious integration , namely the presence in the same schools of francophones , anglophones and allophones who , by living together , learn to know each other , which results in a better integration of these various groups .
i sincerely believe that our diversity is a source of tremendous wealth and pride , the very foundation on which to build a remarkable future for our country .
one of the characteristics of this diversity is its attachment to its roots , traditions and identity so the people who make up this diversity understand even better the need and will for French Quebeckers to promote their roots and traditions and secure their language , culture and identity .
the people who make up this diversity can be tremendously credible ambassadors of Quebec ' s unique character in an effort of inclusion and respect .
i believe that this harmony comes not from the denominational or linguistic features of our school structures , but from the political will that , with a very few exceptions that need to be marginalized , is characteristic of all our people and our authorities .
the schools and the communities complement each other remarkably well .
they have done and will continue to do a very good job within this diversity that we like so much , in order to promote dignity , respect and the sensible inclusion of each and every member of our community .
i am putting all my faith in this and I know time will prove me right .
besides , if we were to vote against this amendment to section 93 before us today , we would be keeping in place , especially in Montreal and Quebec City , such a burdensome school system that the administration costs would bring about a decrease in the budget for direct services to our children .
under these circumstances , I think it would be totally unacceptable .
this brings me to some issues that , as far as I know , have yet to be addressed during this debate .
they attend a school they identify with , in an environment they are familiar with , a reassuring environment that gives them a sense of stability .
the name or the affiliation of their school board does not matter to them at all .
what does matter to them is how nice their teacher is , a teacher they often idolize .
what does matter to them is their school friends , their classroom , which they have a hand in decorating , their principal , who is sometimes an authority figure when their behaviour leaves something to be desired , and sometimes a source of pride when they are able to come and sign the principal ' s book of honour .
in short , this is such an essential human context .
this human context can be preserved within the contemplated reform .
i do , however , see two conditions required : first , that school boards can share the same buildings , at least for a while , to avoid wholesale transfers of children from one school to another .
this is perfectly feasible , provided there is a willingness to put the interest of the children first .
second : to allow transitional periods that vary according to the circumstances .
a few days ago , the hon. member for Brome - Missisquoi gave us an example of successful integration in the eastern townships .
at the secondary school level at Ch 芒 teauguay , linguistic integration is , to all intents and purposes , already a fait accompli , because English speaking Catholics and English speaking Protestants attend the same school .
in such cases , the transition period could therefore be shorter than in certain schools in my riding , for example , where the change to language - based schools might be translated into the transfer of hundreds of students , teachers , school administrators and so on , with all of the uncertainties and upheavals that go with this for all involved .
let us try imagine the feelings of our administrators and teachers , for example , when they do not have the slightest idea what they will be doing tomorrow , with whom , where , or how .
progress must not mean dehumanization .
the Quebec government has a golden opportunity to combine the restructuring of the school system with the humanism that implementing a project of such scope requires .
it is a real challenge , and I put it to the government .
in conclusion , with the overwhelming majority of Quebeckers , regardless of their language or their origin , I invite this House to confirm that the Constitution of Canada serves Quebec and that it gives Quebec every means to progress and to grow .
as member for Brossard - La Prairie , I will vote in favour of the proposed constitutional amendment .
i know that all the representatives of the Du Go 茅 land , Brossard and South Shore school boards will take up the challenge to ensure that no minority will feel like one .
i know that the people of Brossard - La Prairie will rise to the challenge .
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu 茅 bec , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , with the support of a strong majority of Quebeckers , the Government of Quebec plans to set up linguistic school systems to replace denominational systems , which were defensible in 1867 , but are discriminatory at the dawn of the 21 st century .
in order to carry out such a reorganization of the Quebec school system , the National Assembly voted unanimously in favour of a resolution to amend the Constitution by eliminating the application of subsections ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) of section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 .
in response to this change so long desired in Quebec - for over 30 years - the Government of Quebec has sought this amendment from Parliament .
before making its request , Quebec received a commitment from the federal government that it would not oppose it .
that is the context in which Quebec initiated the current process .
the Constitution Act of 1982 provides several possible amending formulas .
section 43 is almost unanimously recognized as the most appropriate with respect to Quebec ' s request .
selecting this method would not set a precedent , as three other provinces have done the same since 1987 .
using section 43 was required to meet the challenges some provinces were facing .
some may argue that the issues were different , but , in each case , it was a matter of adjusting to new realities .
Quebec did not see anything threatening in requesting these constitutional changes , since they applied only to the affected provinces .
it is in the same spirit of openmindedness and understanding that Quebec sought approval for the proposed amendment .
more than 60 organizations and individuals testified before the committee and expressed their views on various aspects of the Quebec school system issue .
in spite of the concerns raised by some witnesses , there appears to be a very clear consensus about the need to make such an amendment so that Quebec can set up a modern school system that is more open and in line with today ' s pluralistic society .
in this context , the National Assembly ' s action is legitimate and is part of a long process that had started and stopped over the years as governments changed .
the will of the people of Quebec to replace the denominational system with a linguistic school system has nothing to do with the place religion should have in schools , but rather with how school boards should be organized in Quebec .
as for the place of religion in schools , the debate on this issue has been ongoing for decades and is likely to continue into the future , given our tradition of tolerance .
for the time being , like all players in the system , Minister Marois is aware of the major changes the school system is about to undergo .
second , there is the issue of consultations : were they sufficient or not ?
third , there is the place of instruction in the schools : what guarantees are given ?
will they be adequate ?
will amending section 93 affect Quebec ' s anglophone minorities ?
and , finally , there is the use of the Constitution Act , 1982 , if I have time left , to which Quebec was not a signatory .
these are the five points I felt it most important to raise here today .
but before doing so , I would first like to describe the historical context in which section 93 was passed and try to explain why this provision no longer corresponds to today ' s reality .
the preamble to section 93 gives full and complete jurisdiction to the provinces in matters of education .
paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section essentially give educational guarantees and privileges to Roman Catholic and Protestant minorities .
this went without saying in 1867 .
why ?
because in the 19 th century , denomination and language were practically interchangeable .
the very great majority of francophones were Catholic and , generally speaking , the majority of anglophones were Protestant .
but this constitutional arrangement no longer corresponds to the reality in Quebec at the close of the 20 th century .
there are no longer any sociological correlations between Quebec ' s anglophone and Protestant minorities .
the numbers speak for themselves .
of students whose mother tongue is English enrolled in public primary or secondary schools in Quebec as a whole , 34 % are Catholic , 33 % give another religion or none at all , and 32 % are Protestant .
if we take Montreal Island , the situation is even more illuminating : 43 % are Catholic , 46 % give another religion or none at all , and only 10 % are Protestant .
the numbers speak for themselves .
look at the situation in Montreal : 46 % of students give another religion .
another thing that should be known about paragraphs 1 and 2 of section 93 is that they represent a form of discrimination that is contrary to the Quebec and Canadian charters of rights and freedoms .
sections 3 and 4 also allow the federal government to step in in order to remedy an action taken or not taken by provincial authorities .
in fact , the first of these powers was used only once in 1896 , and the second was never used .
so these various points can illustrate how a situation where certain privileges are granted , in Montreal and in Quebec City in school boards because of denominational structures , how people who belong to a religion other than the Catholic or the Protestant religion are being assigned in a manner that makes them feel discriminated against in their choice to go to a denominational school .
i would like now to deal with the issue of consensus .
we will hear what four major stakeholders had to say and listen to what the people had to say through public hearings .
the Coalition pour la d 茅 confessionnalisation du syst 猫 me scolaire , a coalition for the support of a non - denominational school system representing 43 organizations and close to two million people , including students , teachers , managers , school principles , support personnel , popular , political and national interest associations and others , this is not an insignificant body .
this coalition came forward to tell us that the constitutional amendment requested by Quebec reflects a very large consensus in Quebec society .
this group goes even further and states that the constraints of Section 93 must stop applying to Quebec so that our school system can be reformed to adjust to the modern and pluralistic society we live in .
in their brief presented to the Commission des 茅 tats g 茅 n 茅 raux sur l '茅 ducation , on August 8 , 1995 , the bishops also supported Quebec ' s initiative .
they stated :
with the redesign of the Public Education Act and considering the judicial perspective provided by the supreme court in 1993 , we feel that this change is desirable throughout Quebec , including in the cities of Montreal and Quebec .
i would like to add that the Right Reverend Andrew S . Hutchison , Bishop of Montreal , in a letter to Minister Dion , stated :
the changes to section 93 proposed by the Government of Quebec , by which it would no longer be required to maintain denominational school boards , appear reasonable and in compliance with the positions traditionally adopted by the Anglican Church .
furthermore , the Jewish Congress for the Quebec City region stated :
it is the responsibility of the government to adjust the school system to the realities of Quebec society by applying the principle of equality of religions in its policies .
to do so , it must have the necessary tools to implement such changes .
the average citizen was also able to express his or her views on this issue .
several public hearings were held over the last ten years in Quebec .
a recent poll has shown that slightly more than 58 % of the people are in favour of substituting linguistic boards for the existing Catholic and Protestant school boards in Quebec .
something even more eloquent is that 77.8 % of respondents think that the school system should be the same throughout Quebec , instead of having something different in Montreal and Quebec City .
these figures speak for themselves .
unanimity has not been achieved , but there is a clear consensus in Quebec .
let me turn to the consultation process .
some people claim that there has been little or no consultation in Quebec .
as has been said several times in the House today , the discussion on linguistic school boards has been going on in Quebec for almost 40 years .
a number of legal initiatives and consultations have been undertaken in order to deal with the matter .
i would like to review the main steps of the consultation process in Quebec .
first of all , we have had the royal commission of inquiry on education in 1961 .
the Parent report tabled in 1963 recommended that the legislation not recognize denominational school boards .
then came a period of fastidious and exhausting exercises that , despite feats of ingenuity , failed to deal effectively with the constraints of subsections 93 ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) .
the most recent reform exercise took place in 1988 , when the National Assembly passed Bill 107 .
bill 107 would have superimposed linguistic boards on top of the religious boards in Montreal and Quebec City for the sake of the religious rights protected under section 93 .
in the rest of the province , we would have had linguistic school boards only .
for the benefit of the House , I will take a few moments to try to explain the concrete impact of the reform that was proposed .
under Bill 107 , in Quebec City and in Montreal , there would have been six overlapping school boards : a French Catholic school board , a French Protestant school board , an English Catholic school board , an English Protestant school board , a French non - denominational school board and an English non - denominational school board .
elsewhere in Quebec , there would have been four overlapping school boards : a French Protestant school board , and so on .
the same situation would have occurred .
i cannot make head or tail of it .
in the real world , people in their everyday lives do not want to subject their children to this .
can you imagine what would happen : children who play in the same parks , who live on the same street , would be separated and sent to different schools because their parents are not of the same denomination .
that is what would happen .
so , the chairperson of the Centrale de l ' enseignement du Qu 茅 bec , Lorraine Pag 茅 , was very clear on this .
this is , once again , reaffirmed in the Sondagem poll : 88.3 % of Quebeckers are in favour of sending all children to the same school , regardless of the religious faith of their parents .
Quebecers had another opportunity to express their views through these polls , which clearly show that we should be more open to allow this type of integration .
to finish the list of consultations , there was the Kenniff report and the Proulx - Woehrling proposal , the education summit in 1996 and a parliamentary committee on Bill 109 .
so to deny the request made by the National Assembly of Quebec would postpone indefinitely a true reform of the Quebec school system .
i think we must agree to Quebec ' s request and respect the kind of reform it wants .
i would also like to address the issue of language rights because it came up in committee .
in terms of language rights , a few witnesses claimed that the amendment to section 93 would affect anglophone minorities in Quebec .
this is absolutely false .
as a matter of fact , the member for Brossard - La Prairie mentioned a few moments ago that it is not section 93 which guarantees the rights of the anglophone community , but it is section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which guarantees the right of the francophone and anglophone minorities to receive instruction in their own language .
it is not section 93 .
the jurisprudence is clear and generous with regard to minority language educational rights under section 23 of the Canadian charter , contrary to what some people are trying to convey as a message from Quebec .
moreover , people must not be overly suspicious of the way Quebec treats its anglophone minority .
anglophones in Quebec manage their own educational institutions and benefit from a complete school system from junior kindergarten to university .
they also manage their health and social service networks , and they have numerous means of communication in their own language .
this is a far cry from what is going on at Montfort hospital .
the proverbial generosity of Quebeckers is recognized all over the world .
on April 10 , the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe said that " the situation of Quebec ' s English speaking minority is an excellent example of the protection of a linguistic minority ' s rights '' .
i know that other issues were raised by various witnesses .
some thought schools would no longer provide religious instruction and wondered about what would happen to religion in schools .
we listened with great respect and attention to those concerned about preserving religious instruction in schools .
we remind them that section 41 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees parents the right to demand that their children receive a religious or moral education according to their beliefs .
moreover , the Education Act clearly states that Catholics and Protestants can both exercise this right , regardless of their numbers .
second , the act creates duties and obligations for school organizations as regards denominational provisions .
third , the Education Act provides that a school board can organize moral or religious instruction for a denomination other than Catholic or Protestant .
some said that these were not constitutional guarantees , but the safeguards provided in section 41 of the charter are quasi - constitutional .
Quebeckers as a whole are very respectful of the choice parents would make as to whether or not they want to keep a denominational school , or want religious instruction in schools .
i think there will be such a debate in Quebec and that it will be carried out democratically with all the tolerance that Quebeckers are known for .
if there are still members in this House who hesitate to support the unanimous request by the Quebec National Assembly , I ask them to listen to this call coming from all parts of Quebec , from the Magdalen Islands to Abitibi , from the Gasp 茅 region to Ungava , from Quebec City , L 茅 vis , Granby , Baie - Comeau , Saint - Henri and the greater Montreal area .
Quebeckers are appealing to you and are asking you to support them in their efforts to provide their children with a modern school system that is responsive to the realities of modern Quebec .
with one voice , in a spirit of openness and pride , let us applaud the National Assembly ' s initiative and join with their institutions in providing Quebec with a modern school system that can provide a model for today ' s world .
i will be voting yes .
Mr. Nick Discepola ( Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the amendment we are being asked to support is the repeal of subsections 1 to 4 of Section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 .
since the beginning , in the National Assembly , the Government of Quebec and the Parti Quebecois have taken it upon themselves to include in the preamble to their request that they do not recognize the Constitution of 1982 .
it is odd that the Government of Quebec has taken such a decision .
it is odder still that Bloc Quebecois members have taken the same position .
it is because of section 43 of the Constitution of 1982 , which the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois refuse to accept or to recognize as being relevant , that we can now discuss this amendment ; in fact , it is Section 43 that provides for the right of the province of Quebec , with a simple resolution from the National Assembly , to request a bilateral constitutional amendment , without the consent of the other provinces .
furthermore , subsection 33.1 of the 1982 Constitution , which , again , Quebec has not accepted , allows Bill 107 on public education and the amendment proposed in Bill 109 to override the unconstitutional aspect by using the notwithstanding clause .
i was wondering if the member from Quebec could answer two questions .
if the English community had not felt that its access to linguistic schools was protected under section 23 , if the anglophone community was not convinced that the 1982 Constitution provided some protection , does the member really believe that we would have had such a consensus in Quebec ?
can she admit in this House , just as the Quebec intergovernmental affairs minister himself admitted , that one would indeed have to be naive to think that the Constitution of 1982 does not apply everywhere in the country ?
can the member answer these two questions ?
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon :
Mr. Speaker , I do not think there is any justification for trying to use the action taken by the National Assembly to offer thinly veiled praise for the unilateral patriation in 1982 , of which the Prime Minister was one of the main architects .
Mr. Nick Discepola :
thanks to him -
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon :
you asked me to answer your question , sir .
i can tell you , on the subject of the resolution of Quebec ' s National Assembly to not recognize the Constitution of 1982 , that there is a difference between " to not recognize " and " to be subject to '' .
we are still part of Canada .
we may not recognize it , but we are subject to it .
let us not mix debates .
i will stop here on that matter .
here again , a number of debates are being mixed up .
it will be debated at some other time , in Quebec and not here .
section 93 does not guarantee the protection of anglophone minorities in Quebec and francophone minorities elsewhere .
the member for Bourassa put it very well earlier , when he said that section 93 had nothing to do with protecting language rights in Quebec .
this is the sort of debate they wanted to get us involved in , but this debate and the committee ' s mandate concern the repeal of subsections 1 to 4 so that denominational school boards may be replaced by linguistic school boards .
i hope I have answered succinctly , because the member wanted to drag me into a much broader debate .
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris - Moose Mountain , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have some questions I would like the hon. member for Quebec to address .
during the course of her deliberation , and I must say she did a good job , she mentioned that all of Quebec , and she named the different geographical areas , were all very much in support of this resolution .
i do not doubt that it is the majority .
i have two questions .
first , have you ever considered that , by deleting sections 1 to 4 -
the Deputy Speaker :
the hon. member will please address the Chair rather than the hon. member .
Mr. Roy Bailey :
i am sorry , Mr. Speaker .
if you delete sections 1 to 4 from section 93 , has the hon. member given any consideration to what danger that may create in other provinces which are watching this debate extremely close ?
i know in my province there are three minority boards .
they all have a petition .
they are all very much concerned about deleting sections 1 to 4 from section 93 in the hope that somehow the Charter of Rights will protect those things once they are extracted .
that is the concern in western Canada .
if the Charter of Rights will protect them after they have disappeared , why will the Charter of Rights not protect them when it is there ?
my constituents are extremely interested in this .
i hope I am hearing that incorrectly .
in the history of our country we have had religion taught in the schools .
those people who want religion in the school should have that right under our constitution .
i would like the hon. member to address those two questions .
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to remind the hon. member of the Reform Party that I never spoke of unanimity ; we are talking about consensus .
in fact , that is the problem we encountered in committee , where consensus was sometimes understood to mean unanimous consent .
such rights were granted on very different bases in Montreal and in Quebec City .
for other regions , it was a matter of dissent .
we know full well that children from several denominations already study in this kind of system .
witnesses have explained the situation and how this would not be a problem .
with all due respect , I never said , and far be it from me not to want religious education to continue in schools , quite the contrary , and this is a debate that we will be having in Quebec .
i would point out that this matter will be debated in Quebec , and the proposed amendment is designed to satisfy Quebec ' s wishes .
so , if the same kind of debate were held in other parts of Canada , in other provinces , perhaps you could examine a variety of possible amendments , that you would approve or dismiss as the case may be .
in Quebec , however , there is consensus on this matter .
the Deputy Speaker :
i am sorry , but the time allowed for questions and comments has run out .
the hon. parliamentary secretary on a point of order .
Mr. Nick Discepola :
i rise on a point of order , Mr. Speaker .
it was simply a point of clarification .
