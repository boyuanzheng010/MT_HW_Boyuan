house OF COMMONS
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the foreign affairs minister said in 1993 that limiting debate brings this House into disgrace .
what is the matter over there ?
why do you not want to have public debate on the floor of the House of Commons ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we wanted to have a debate .
it is the opposition that moved a motion to make sure that there would be no debate .
they said " Let ' s postpone the debate '' .
they do not want to debate for six months so the government cannot respect the agreement that we made with the provinces .
we want a debate .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , we have been waiting to debate the CPP thing all summer .
we were elected by the people of this country to come to the floor of the House of Commons and debate the issues of the day .
this government is restricting our privileges as members of Parliament to debate the most important tax issue of this Parliament .
why does the government restrict the debate for ordinary members of the House of Commons when it is the most important tax issue in this entire Parliament ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
i will be very calm , Mr. Speaker .
it is very difficult to be more ridiculous than that because they moved a motion that says " This House declines to give second reading to Bill C - 2 '' .
they declined to have a debate .
they are afraid to debate .
they want to postpone it for six months .
we want a debate .
we want to hear witnesses .
we will have a debate and witnesses will come .
we will have a CPP that will protect Canadian pensioners in the 21 st century .

canada PENSION PLAN
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
surely the Prime Minister has not forgotten when he was in opposition these motions are inclined to provoke debate ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is very clear what has happened .
i mentioned this in the House the other day .
there are two ways to destroy the Canada pension plan .
the only issue before the House now is why is the NDP walking arm and arm toward the sunset and out of the CPP ?
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the finance minister knows that it is intellectually dishonest in the extreme to suggest that we want to destroy the Canada pension plan .
it is precisely because we want to strengthen it that we want a debate .
my question is for the Prime Minister .
he said it was the amendments that caused him to move closure .
is he saying or will he say now that in the absence of such amendments on future legislation there will be no closure , there will be no time allocation and we will be able to debate legislation until such time as the matter is confirmed or dismissed ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , if the NDP members want to preserve the Canada pension plan then why will they not let it go to committee where there can be debate ?
why will they not let the Canada pension plan pass so that we can get on to track two where we can deal with mandatory credit splitting , where we can deal with a number of issues that were raised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance ?
why will the NDP not attempt for once to be constructive as we head into the 21 st century ?

grain TRANSPORTATION
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
it is on an issue close and dear to the hearts of western Canadian farmers .
the CTA inquiry into the grain transportation delays that occurred last winter were supposed to start in August .
it was then delayed to November and now it is delayed until April .
agricultural stakeholders have said repeatedly that they want immediate action taken on this issue and will no longer accept political juggling acts .
is your department prepared to immediately conduct -
the Speaker :
the hon. member should always address his question to the Chair .
i will permit the hon. Minister of Transport to reply the preamble .
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in terms of grain transportation we have been preoccupied with the fast movement of grain since we came into office .
we have had a number of meetings with stakeholders across the country attended by my colleagues in agriculture and the minister responsible for the wheat board .
the CTA appeal does cause us some problem but it is not stopping us from doing the preparatory work , such as the terms of reference , going over lists of individuals who could conduct the review .
even though recruitment has not started we are working toward an early start .
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my supplementary question is for the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board .
producers are sick and tired of hearing who is to blame for the grain delays of last winter .
what producers want is a government that is not going to hide behind the CTA hearing in an effort to prolong the initiative .
producers want answers now .
the minister has the authority but will he have the political will ?
will he walk out of the House , call the chief commissioner of the CWB , cancel the CTA hearing and get a review under way right now ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
he is also asking me to exercise a directive power under the existing Canadian Wheat Board Act to which the opposition is unalterably opposed .
maybe the most advisable thing to modernize procedures is to pass Bill C - 4 at the earliest possible moment and put farmers in charge .

presence IN THE GALLERY
the Speaker :
today is a rather special day for us in the House for a reason other than question period .
we have with us today a large group of very distinguished Canadians .
Canadians will not soon forget the Saguenay floods or those of the Red River Valley .
they have become part of our history because of the extent of the disaster but mostly because in a time of crisis a remarkable spirit of co - operation emerged that left no one indifferent and brought all Canadians together in Quebec and in Manitoba .
Canadian military personnel led rescue and relief efforts working alongside civilian volunteers in difficult and dangerous conditions .
humanitarian agencies , municipal , provincial and federal officials together came to the aid of families and communities .
Canadians from every part of the country responded generously to appeals for assistance .
it was a remarkable show of Canadian solidarity .
it was the finest possible example of team Canada at work .
sometimes , it is the most difficult of times that show what it is that unites a community .
in the Saguenay , and in Manitoba , thousands of Canadians battled together to save homes and lives , to help their neighbours and to rebuild communities .
there are so many of them , these volunteers , these heroes and heroines , that it would be impossible to receive them all here in the House of Commons .
but what an honour it is for us to receive 30 Canadian military personnel and 40 civilians who brought assistance to the disaster victims .
those of you who are here before me today represent all of the men and women who took part in that effort of Canadian solidarity .
through you , we salute their extraordinary work , their courage , their spirit of co - operation , and their readiness to lend a helping hand .
we , the collective members of the House of Commons and the representatives of us , the 30 million Canadians , thank you and all those you represent for showing us that there is a powerful sense of community in Canada and for reminding us that when it really counts we are there for each other .
to the heroes and heroines du Saguenay et de la rivi 茅 re Rouge , please stand .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
the Speaker :
my colleagues , in your name and on your behalf I will be receiving these distinguished Canadian in room 216 for a reception .
i formally invite all of you to meet them and to speak with them right after question period .

the LATE CLAUDE ELLIS
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise to say a few words in tribute to Mr. Claude Ellis who was a member of Parliament elected for the CCF in the city of Regina in 1953 and again in 1957 .
unfortunately Mr. Ellis passed away on October 1 of this year at the age of 77 .
he served two terms in the House .
he was well known as a dedicated member of Parliament who served his constituents very well .
he was also a superb educator and teacher .
as a matter of fact , he was one of my professors when I first attended university back in the mid - 1960 s .
Mr. Ellis was also one of the founders of the CCF in Saskatchewan in the 1930 s , 1940 s and 1950 s .
he was very active in the educational movement , in the trade union movement and in the formation of the CCF both provincially and federally .
at this stage I pay tribute to his wife Bessie who has been an activist for many years , to his three sons and his daughter and to their spouses , to his grandchildren and great - grandchildren , and to his friends .
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , like the member for Qu ' Appelle I was saddened to hear of the passing of Mr. Claude Ellis , a former member of Parliament for Regina City from 1952 to 1958 representing the CCF .
Mr. Ellis ' interest in politics started very early in life .
during that time Mr. Ellis was very well served by his excellent speaking ability , an ability for which he won both oratory prizes and debating trophies , culminating in a trip to Guelph , Ontario , where he walked away with the Canadian debating championship .
in the House of Commons Mr. Ellis was an advocate for the less well off in society , in particular in the areas of housing and health care , helping to form the caring society that Canada has become , a tradition that all of us from Regina would aspire to continue .
Mr. Ellis is survived by his wife Bessie , three sons and one daughter .
on behalf of the Government of Canada I would like to offer our sincere condolences to the Ellis family .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , on behalf of the official opposition I would like to pay tribute to Claude Ellis and the work he did in the Canadian parliament .
the minister mentioned that he was involved at a very young age .
he was involved at 16 years old .
how many of us were thinking and breathing politics at that age ?
he had a pretty remarkable career .
think of the thrill he must have felt as a young man when he appeared on the same stage as J . S . Woodsworth , one of the founders of the CCF , and Mr. J . Coldwell , the national leader at that time .
what a thrill it must have been for that young man .
he was elected in 1953 and again in 1957 .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
miss Deborah Grey :
on behalf of my family and the official opposition I wish his family well and thank them for the public service they and their family shared through Claude Ellis .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I did not have the honour of knowing Mr. Ellis , to whom tribute is being paid today , personally .
but I want to say that when someone has sat in the House for two terms of office and worked hard for his constituents , we cannot but express our admiration and note that this was truly someone who put himself out for those he represented .
he was a CCF member , someone who undoubtedly did some very useful work in the Parliament of Canada and who spared no effort in serving his fellow citizens in the Regina area .
on behalf of Bloc Quebecois members , I would therefore like to express our deepest condolences to his entire family and to tell them that we are keenly aware that there were lengthy periods during which they had to manage without Mr. Ellis , because he had to be here in Ottawa to serve his constituents .
they have our sympathy and our deepest respect for the sacrifices they were willing to make so that he could do his work in the House .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
although he was a long time resident of Regina , the city he represented in the House of Commons , Mr. Ellis was born in Weyburn , Saskatchewan , the son of Bill Ellis and Peggy Dawson Gibson .
he was educated at public schools and Scott Collegiate in Regina , moving on to teachers college .
from this Claude Ellis enjoyed a lengthy career as an educator , teaching in Manor , Saskatchewan , and at his alma mater of Scott Collegiate .
Mr. Ellis ' impressive career came to an end at the University of Regina where he was awarded the title of professor emeritus .
Claude Ellis did take some time from teaching to represent the city of Regina in the House of Commons .
he was first elected in 1953 and re - elected in 1957 , during which time he actively articulated the needs and concerns of his constituents .
even when he did not serve as an elected MP , Mr. Ellis remained a strong supporter of the CCF movement and later the New Democratic Party .
he formed a vibrant partnership with his beautiful wife Bessie , who for many years has been a tireless worker in the community .
together they raised three sons and one daughter , who in turn blessed Claude and Bessie Ellis with five grandchildren and two great - grandchildren .
when Claude Ellis passed away on October 1 , parliament lost a former member , Saskatchewan lost a distinguished educator , but most important the Ellis family lost a husband , a father , a brother , a grandfather and a great - grandfather .
we could only hope that they find solace in the wonderful life he lived and the contributions he made to education and to the public service .
on behalf of the Progressive Conservative caucus I offer my condolences to members of the Ellis family on their loss .
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I too would like to join with colleagues in the House of Commons to pay tribute to Claude Ellis .
i had the honour and privilege of knowing Claude Ellis for the last 24 years .
i represented him and his wife Bessie in the 1993 to 1997 term .
throughout that period Bessie and Claude were advisors to me .
they sat on my executive and were very wise counsel on many issues , in particular when in the last parliament the New Democratic Party did not have a lot of resources .
their experience and counsel were very important to us .
i had occasion to have supper with Mr. Ellis about 18 months ago when he was in Ottawa with his wife Bessie and we talked about a lot of important issues affecting our country .
even during the last couple of months in Regina he was always very keen on ensuring that New Democrats represented citizens well in parliament .
he was very keen on ensuing that issues such as pensions were a priority and he asked us to ensure that the principles and fundamental issues which are important to all Canadians remain on the agenda of parliament .
i want to join with members in acknowledging Mr. Ellis ' contribution to the city of Regina , the province of Saskatchewan and to our country .
as citizens we have suffered a great loss as a result of his passing .
i appreciate the opportunity to extend my condolences to his widow Bessie and their family .
the Speaker :
we also have tributes to Mr. J . Chester MacRae a former member of the Progressive Conservative Party .
* * *
the LATE MR. J . CHESTER MACRAE
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the citizens of New Brunswick and the constituents of the former federal riding of York - Sunbury are mourning the death of long - time resident and friend , John Chester MacRae .
the former member of Parliament and D - Day veteran died this past Sunday after a brief illness .
he taught in the public school system until 1940 when his regiment was called out to active service .
he served in Britain and France , going into France on D - Day .
for service in France he was awarded the Military Cross and after his return to Canada received the Efficiency Decoration .
j . Chester MacRae continued his interest in the military after the war and throughout his life with his final appointment being honorary Colonel of the First Battalion , the Royal New Brunswick Regiment ( Carleton and York ) .
former New Brunswick Premier Hugh John Flemming once described Chester MacRae as being a man who it was a privilege and pleasure to know , stating that " he was a great Canadian , distinguished in everything he ' s ever undertaken '' .
people from the Fredericton area will always remember Chester MacRae for his dry wit .
he once said " My relationship with the Conservative Party was a happy and cordial one , although elections to me were agony . "
as a long - time member of the Royal Canadian Legion he served as branch president , provincial president , grand patron and a life member of the St. Machar Masonic Lodge , Aberdeen , Scotland .
in one of his final speeches in the House 31 years ago , he reflected on a wide range of matters , some of which are very relevant today .
he spoke on the issue of the population explosion , of the need for peace in the world , on the equality of all races , and the matter dearest to his heart , the veterans of Canada and , indeed , the veterans of all countries .
he stated in this Chamber that those veterans who were prisoners of war underwent greater hardships than perhaps any of the rest of us who were privileged to serve in World War II.
the people of Fredericton and the people of New Brunswick will long remember J . Chester MacRae for his dedication , his service , his kindness and that rare quality , his heroism .
Chet MacRae is survived by his wife of 64 years , Mina Catherine Gerrard MacRae , one daughter Marjory Ann and her husband Jack Patterson of Vancouver , one daughter - in - law Darlene MacRae of Saint John , 10 grandchildren and six great grandchildren .
Chet MacRae would want to be remembered as an ordinary Canadian who served his country well .
this he did .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am honoured , humbled and saddened to pay tribute to Chester MacRae .
being the wonderful gentleman that he was , after the election he came to visit me .
we spent a wonderful afternoon discussing the difference between being a member of Parliament in 1993 and being a member of Parliament in the late fifties and early sixties .
i asked Chester to represent the Government of Canada and to lay the wreath in Fredericton .
this was the last Remembrance Day before the onset of his illness .
during the campaign I had the opportunity to drop in and visit Chester at the DVA in Fredericton .
he was very alert .
the people of the community of Fredericton know what a contribution Chester MacRae made in war , in peace , as an educator .
they remember what he did for the Legion , for veterans and for his community .
he will be missed .
all his family and his friends in Fredericton have our condolences .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
the dedication one puts toward the goal of improving one ' s country is the mark of a great person .
Chester MacRae worked tirelessly toward the improvement of Canada for future generations .
not only did Chester MacRae serve Canada and Parliament but he was a decorated war veteran who served in both England and France , having participated in the D - Day invasion of France .
for his service he was awarded the Military Cross .
just yesterday I walked through the visitor ' s welcome centre to see Chester ' s name on a plaque that commemorates those who preceded us in this House .
in addition to his honoured name we all remember his qualities of integrity , compassion and devotion , in particular toward the interests of Canada ' s veterans .
Chester MacRae will be sorely missed but never forgotten in this House .
we offer our condolences to the members of his family , to his friends and colleagues and our sincere regrets in his passing .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , we were saddened yesterday to learn of the death of Chester MacRae , who , for 15 years , from 1957 to 1972 , was a Conservative member of this House .
i did not know Mr. MacRae personally , but everyone I talked to described him as a devoted individual and member of the Conservative Party for 15 years , and especially as a devoted officer in the Canadian army .
Mr. MacRae was considered a hero in the second world war .
he even took part in the landing in France .
although a Conservative , Mr. MacRae was known as an ambassador of peace , mutual assistance between peoples , and equality .
it was more likely the vision of Lester B . Pearson that he carried abroad than the Conservative vision of things .
on behalf of myself and my party , the Bloc Quebecois , I offer my sincere condolences to Mr. MacRae ' s family .
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , on behalf of my colleagues in the New Democratic Party , I would like to pay my respects to the memory of J . Chester MacRae .
Mr. MacRae was a Progressive Conservative member of Parliament from 1957 to 1972 .
he was a decorated war veteran who served in both England and France .
as a fellow New Brunswicker , Mr. MacRae served the people of New Brunswick well .
i did not have the pleasure to sit in the House with him , but he was known in Parliament as a devoted and tireless advocate for veterans ' interests .
my colleagues and I in the New Democratic Party extend our sincere condolences to Mr. MacRae ' s family , especially to his wife Mina Catherine , his daughter Marjory Ann and his two sisters .
his contribution to Canadian and New Brunswick political life will remain with us for the years to come .

privilege
time ALLOCATION
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question of privilege arises out of the motion that the government intends to move with respect to time allocation on Bill C - 2 .
it has to do with what I regard to be the responsibilities of the Chair to protect the rights and privileges of members of this House of Commons to engage in adequate debate on matters of national importance .
the Chair will know that the time allocation motion has to do with the amendments to the Canada pension plan .
this is a national social program , an income security plan which is very rarely before the House , very rarely debated , very rarely amended .
this is one of those occasions when it is being amended , therefore , it is a unique opportunity for members of the House of Commons to put their views on the record on what our national pension plan system should look like .
we will disagree with each other about that .
the Reform Party will have its position , as will the NDP .
the government will have its position , as reflected in the legislation .
my concern is that the Chair consider , before seeing whoever it is who will be moving the motion on behalf of the government - we have notice that the motion will be moved - not seeing the mover of the motion as a way of using the power of the Chair to intervene on behalf of members of Parliament , both collectively and individually , in a situation where our right to adequate debate is being violated by the government ' s rush to judgment on the appropriateness of time allocation .
others have said in the course of comments during question period that somehow the amendments that were moved by the opposition were an attempt to close off debate .
quite the contrary .
we know these motions are procedurally designed in such as way , whether a six - month hoist or whatever , and are often moved in order to create the possibility of more debate so that the government cannot move to the question on the main motion .
it is a bit disingenuous for the government to say that this was an attempt to close off debate .
it was , rather , to prevent or to act in a preventive way against the government moving to the question right away by not putting up speakers .
an amendment was moved , a subamendment was moved and right after the subamendment was moved the government gave notice of closure .
how long did we debate this motion ?
we debated it for one day .
we did not debate it the next day in the morning because we were debating Bill C - 4 .
then we moved to Bill C - 2 and we were hardly into the second or third hour and the government moved closure .
Mr. Speaker , I know that for you to do something about this would be to break with Canadian precedent .
i am aware of the significance of what I am asking you to do .
i have only asked a Speaker to do this once before and it was Speaker Fraser in the context of the North American Free Trade Agreement .
but you will know that at Westminster and in other Parliaments , Speakers have sometimes taken upon themselves the responsibility of ensuring that the rights of Parliament collectively are not abused by a government which moves too quickly to closure or to time allocation .
it is precisely what I am asking you to consider here today , that this is an occasion where very early in this Parliament there is no reason to believe that the debate would have gone on and on .
i think it is the wrong way to start off this Parliament .
we were doing just fine .
we were getting along even though we disagree with each other politically .
for the government to move at this time as I suggested earlier is a very unfortunate thing .
but it is an unfortunate thing that could be remedied by the Chair taking , admittedly , new responsibilities but not responsibilities that are totally out of character with what Speakers have done in other Parliaments , to intervene on behalf of the collective rights of parliamentarians to adequate debate on a matter of obvious national importance .
Mr. Speaker , I rest my case and I ask you to consider the matter and to consider it urgently because obviously if you were to intervene you would have to do it when the motion was about to be moved .
sometimes Speakers can be given to a judicious blindness when it comes to motions being moved or to breaking new ground by actually arriving at a judgment on this in time to prevent this very unfortunate reaction on the part of the government to the fact that there was lively , informed and concerned debate about CPP reform and it moved to choke it off in the way that it did .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to speak briefly in support of this member ' s point of privilege and lay before you two additional pieces of information which may assist you in responding to this .
first I refer to Beauchesne ' s sixth edition , citation 3 which outlines some elements of the Constitution Act :
without further elaboration , Canada thus was ensured a responsible cabinet system with the assumption that there will always be a recognizable government with a legislative program .
if the electorate so wishes , the system also presupposes an opposition ready and willing to attack the government in an attempt to have its legislation altered or rejected - .
more tentative are such traditional features as respect for the rights of the minority , which precludes a government from using to excess the extensive powers that it has to limit debate or to proceed in what the public and the opposition might interpret as unorthodox ways .
i suggest that is what we have happening here today .
to limit that debate is to permit in effect taxation without effective and adequate representation .
one of the fundamental functions for which Parliament was created was specifically to constrain arbitrary taxation and actions by the executive .
one further piece of reference for your consideration was referred to by the hon. member .
on April 14 , 1987 Speaker Fraser felt it necessary to make this comment to the House on this very same issue :
it is essential to our democratic system that controversial issues should be debated at reasonable length so that every reasonable opportunity shall be available to hear the arguments pro and con and that reasonable delaying tactics should be permissible to enable opponents of a measure to enlist public support for their point of view .
speaker Fraser felt that the Speaker had a role to play in these matters .
he made this statement as a result of protest from the opposition .
ironically one of the most vocal opponents to this abuse at that time was the very minister who has given notice and intends to close off debate on Bill C - 2 after only eight hours of debate on the very first bill to hit this floor , a bill that is over 100 pages long and extremely technical and a bill that happens to have attached to it a schedule which imposes a payroll tax rise of 73 % on millions of Canadians and employers .
the debate has only just begun and we are confident that a reasonable debate will enlist public support for our point of view and that of taxpayers and young Canadians who have little or no voice in this debate .
as Speaker Fraser said , it is essential to our democratic system , and therefore essential for you , Mr. Speaker , to protect the opposition and delay even for one day the government from moving to close off debate in this manner .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would also like to add a few words with respect to the point of privilege raised by the member from the New Democratic Party .
the very first principle of parliamentary law as set out in Beauchesne ' s states :
the principles of Canadian parliamentary law are : to protect a minority and restrain the improvidence or tyranny of a majority ; to secure the transaction of public business in an orderly manner ; to enable every member to express opinions within limits necessary to preserve decorum and prevent an unnecessary waste of time ; to give abundant opportunity for the consideration of every measure , and to prevent any legislative action being taken upon sudden impulse .
there are important issues that have to be considered and discussed .
i would also bring to the Speaker ' s attention the fact that the government House leader has brought forward a motion pursuant to Standing Order 78 ( 3 ) which is , as you know , predicated on the House leader ' s not being able to reach an agreement for the allocation of time for a stage of a bill .
i want to bring to the Chair ' s attention that at no time did the government House leader raise the subject of a time allocation agreement at our meetings .
there was no consultation .
he did ask if a number of our members were prepared to debate further , but there was no consideration given to the fact that there was going to be further debate .
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 78 , I would ask you , in your capacity as Speaker , to rule on the motion and rule it out of order , keeping in mind that there were no actual attempts to reach agreement between the House leaders .
that may or may not be possible but the government House leader has an obligation to ask the question to the other House leaders and permit consultation .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to respond briefly to the question of privilege raised by the House leader of the New Democratic Party and supported by two other members of this House earlier this day .
i think the Chair will need to consider two issues .
one , is the House leader of the New Democratic Party correct about what he has alleged this afternoon ?
two , is he also correct in the purpose of the amendment that he has offered to the House along with other members ?
let me take the points in reverse .
that amendment is further amended by a subamendment in the name of the hon. member for Halifax West .
in his presentation , the hon. member from the New Democratic Party conceded to the fact that the purpose of the amendment was to prevent the bill from proceeding .
he said it in this House some moments ago .
in other words , the amendment is specifically designed to prevent us from having the committee study of the bill .
that is what he admitted to on the floor of this House .
having established that the opposition has admitted today and possibly in its speeches over the last couple of days that the purpose of what it is doing is to prevent the bill from proceeding to the next stage , I believe that any reasonable person would claim that the government has an equal right to propose measures to ensure that the bill does proceed in good and proper form .
hon. members across are heckling , very rudely I might add , at this moment but they should be listening in particular to the judgment that Mr. Speaker will no doubt be giving in a few moments .
it has been alleged that there was no consultation .
yesterday afternoon at 3.30 there was a meeting in which I asked all members present , and all parties were present , whether or not they intended to put more speakers .
only one of the four opposition parties , I believe it was the Bloc Quebecois , indicated a definite number of speakers that it wanted to put up .
shortly afterward after having held the consultation in which I did not get a commitment from all parties represented pursuant to Standing Order 78 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , then on the floor of the House moments later , a further dilatory motion was produced within minutes of the end of our meeting , this time proposed by an NDP member , the purpose of which was again to further delay proceeding on the bill .
that was after the consultation was held .
finally , later yesterday afternoon before I proposed a motion on the floor of this House I even informed my counterpart in the official opposition which I believe was the good and proper thing to do so a motion would not be introduced behind his back .
that was done in good and proper form at a meeting at which Your Honour was present .
Mr. Speaker , you must judge whether an amendment that you will be receiving later is in order .
of course the House has not been seized of that motion yet , which could come later this day .
Mr. Speaker , I submit to you that on the third day of debating this bill , the purpose of which is to refer it to committee after years of consultation in the public generally , to move it to committee so we can hear witnesses on this federal - provincial agreement is not wrong .
to send it to committee for detailed study is not wrong .
it is the good and appropriate thing to do .
for the opposition to produce two different amendments , the purpose of which is dilatory as admitted on the floor of this House today , and the purpose of which is only to make the same hon. members speak not once , not twice but even three times on the same bill at second reading is nothing short of a dilatory measure .
it is quite legitimate for the government and for this House to want to listen to ordinary Canadians , people from the private sector and the provinces as to why this measure is necessary in order to ensure a pension plan for our children and grandchildren .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , there are two points which must be clarified in the House .
the government House leader is incorrect in his assertion that the amendments may be an avenue to limit debate .
the fact of the matter is that our amendment in and of itself is debatable , and that is what we want to do in the House .
we want to debate the merits of the bill through our amendments .
our amendment reflects a difference of opinion in the House , an alternative to be debated .
i question the point of sending the bill to committee if the government is already showing its indifference to any other opinion but its own by shutting down debate .
furthermore , the government House leader indicated today that adequate and reasonable notice was given to me in the House .
as it happened , yesterday I was at a meeting of the Board of Internal Economy .
i was called outside the door and given notice that he was on his way downstairs to give notice to the House .
i hardly call that adequate and reasonable notice in this day and age of democracy .
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on the same question of privilege to provide some clarity .
in my view the government House leader has partially misinformed parliament .
the government House leader and all members know that it is standard procedure for the opposition , and maybe another opposition party or two , to move amendments and subamendments on important bills .
when I was at a meeting yesterday with the government House leader , other House leaders and whips , they asked us how many more speakers we had and we said about five .
the government House leader has forgotten that number .
he also said that the motions we have passed with respect to the amendments would allow each member of Parliament to speak three times .
the majority of New Democratic Party members have not had an occasion to speak once on the bill , never mind three times .
i stepped aside for members of Parliament who have not had an opportunity to speak yet .
it deals with what the government House leader said .
he failed to give New Democrats notice of this motion .
he has failed his unofficial pact , denied the pact , or abandoned the pact to provide some co - operation to deal with issues of a substantive nature .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have new and relevant information on this issue .
i am vice - chair of the House of Commons finance committee .
the government ' s premise that it is important to get this legislation to committee for debate is simply false .
not only has this not been discussed , but the House of Commons finance committee strikes out next week to go on a tour across the country to hear from Canadians on completely different issues .
the clerk and chairman of the committee made it very clear in the discussions we had that in the nine days after that when we will be sitting up until the middle of November we will be hearing witnesses on a completely different issue , the pre - budget hearings .
when the House leader opposite says this legislation is being pushed into committee , I can assure that is absolutely false .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have one piece of information of which I would like you to be aware .
i have not spoken to the bill and I want to speak to the bill .
the Speaker :
members have asked me to rule on a specific question of privilege .
i want to thank all hon. members who have taken part in giving me the information I have before me now .
with regard to what the member for Winnipeg - Transcona said , I am aware and I understand full well the serious nature of this request and the rather innovative way that he suggests it might be resolved .
at this point , unless I have more direction from the entire House and in view of the fact that Speakers have consistently ruled since 1968 that they would not intervene in the quality of whatever discussions took place on either matter , I am left to decide this on what is in the standing orders .

points OF ORDER
decorum IN CHAMBER
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , today when we were making tributes today to Chester MacRae and to Claude Ellis , the House leader for the Liberal Party was screaming across the floor to those who were sitting here .
nevertheless he was .
when we are giving tributes , and I know that you , Sir , have brought this matter to our attention before , I think we should all sit and show respect for the families of those to whom we are paying tribute .
i bring it to your attention , Mr. Speaker , and ask that it be brought to the attention of the House leaders .
the Speaker :
i did not hear those conversations .
at times when we are paying tribute and at other times in the debates , I would hope we would take the time to listen to what we all have to say in the House .
i do not want to go into a debate on this issue .
it is just a normal thing that we accept .
i ask my colleagues once again , when we are making tributes , when we are asking or answering questions , or when we are debating in the House , that we give each other the respect that is due a member of the Canadian Parliament .
i say this to no specific member , but I say it to all of us so that we will be apprised of the situation .
hon. Don Boudria ( Glengarry - Prescott - Russell , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , if you will allow me a very brief moment to respond , I do not know whether or not I responded to heckling from another member .
one knows of the debate that was occurring only moments ago in the House .
if I did , there was no intention on my part to be disrespectful to anyone .
i came to the House 31 years ago , I guess it will be in a few days .
i started as a busboy in the parliamentary restaurant with nothing but respect for this great institution .

request FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE
fishing INDUSTRY
Mr. Bill Matthews ( Burin - St.
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to ask for leave to put forward a motion for a special debate , pursuant to Standing Order 52 , to discuss the critical situation facing the fishing industry on the Pacific coast and in Atlantic Canada and recent events which are causing the government to revise its policies .
just yesterday the auditor general reported his findings to the House .
he drew attention to the fact that he could not find anywhere a clearly defined national fisheries policy on sustainable fisheries .
furthermore , in the past few weeks there have been suggestions and allegations of interference with DFO science , the twisting and manipulation of scientific data .
the ability of the department has been called into question as to whether the Department of Fisheries and Oceans can effectively manage the fisheries resource .
of course , that is a matter of debate right across the country .
as well , the auditor general stated the obvious yesterday when he said that fish stocks in Atlantic Canada are not regenerating .
there are not enough fish in the water to sustain a viable fishing industry .
he also stated the very obvious , in particular to those of us from Atlantic Canada , that there are very few jobs and employment opportunities in the hundreds of rural communities in Atlantic Canada .
what is more compelling is that even since the moratorium was announced in July 1992 , this government , being in power now for four years , has not developed or implemented a strategy or a plan to deal with 35,000 to 40,000 Atlantic Canadians after May 1998 .
we have had an historic day today .
my submission to you , Mr. Speaker , is that if we as elected members of Parliament to this House of Commons are going to have ample opportunity to debate the fisheries crisis on both coasts of our country , we are going to need to do it soon .
it is a matter of urgent public interest .
before the anticipated , hopefully , national policy on fisheries I think every member of this House should have an opportunity to debate the present fisheries crisis on the west and east coasts .
they should be heard .
the government can undertake to listen to all members and to hopefully consider and incorporate some of the ideas that might flow from my proposed debate into a national fisheries policy , especially as it pertains to sustainable fisheries and the difficulties that are being faced by fishers on the west coast , in particular because of the salmon dispute and in the Atlantic because of the decline in our fish stocks .
in conclusion , Mr. Speaker , I would like to submit to you that this matter in my estimation is very urgent and is of great public significance and importance .
speaker ' S RULING
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Burin - St.
George ' s was kind enough to apprise me that he was going to rise and ask for an emergency debate at this time .
i know the issue of the fisheries is of concern to all hon. members in the House .
however , in my view it does not fulfil the requirements for an emergency debate at this time .

canada PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT
the House resumed from October 7 consideration of the motion that Bill C - 2 , an act to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts , be read the second time and referred to a committee ; of the amendment ; and of the amendment to the amendment .
the Deputy Speaker :
when the House last considered the matter , the hon. member for Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke had the floor .
he has four minutes remaining in his speech .
Mr. Hec Clouthier ( Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to be in this hallowed House participating in this debate .
it is rather interesting to note that the party opposite has a void in its argument on the Canada pension plan debate and it was evinced by their void in not being here for the democratic vote .
hopefully we will not be indulging in this vituperative political rhetoric but I guess they will persist .
it reminds me of last night when I left this hallowed Chamber and thought of the viciousness of their attack .
it made me think that this is the last refuge for the vaguely talented on the opposite side .
that is utter rubbish and nonsense .
it is not in any way shape or form a payroll tax .
we do have an employment insurance tax but we are doing everything we possibly can , and have done so since we were elected , to reduce the employment insurance tax not once , not twice but thrice .
we will continue to reduce the employment insurance tax whenever we have the opportunity and the fiscal responsibility to do so .
one thing that we will not reduce is our commitment to Bill C - 2 .
why ?
because this has not been a cursory commitment .
one of the great icons of Canadian political history and it certainly endeared myself to him to know that he was also one of the great icons of the Liberal Party , the late Paul Martin Sr . , was part and parcel of the genesis of this wonderful bill .
i am sure that Paul Martin Sr . , being up in the hallowed house in the celestial heavens with the other saints of political history such as Sir Wilfrid Laurier and Mackenzie King and Lester Pearson , would be smiling broadly knowing that his legacy has lasted with the truly great finance minister in this Liberal Party .
i do not remember it because it is not worthwhile remembering what that acronym stood for .
i would say to hon. members that perhaps CPP stands for a commitment to Paul ' s plan .
we are committed to the duty of government and we most certainly recognize the fact that the challenge of any government is to build a road for its citizens that will lead to a sense of self - satisfaction , a sense of self - esteem and a sense of fulfilment .
this coruscating Bill C - 2 most certainly rises to that challenge .
may I even be so bold as to say that this is a bodacious bill .
hon. members can look up that word .
i notice I have one minute left , Mr. Speaker .
one further minute to expound upon the great magnanimous qualities of Bill C - 2 .
this bill not only rises to the challenge , it supersedes it .
the Deputy Speaker :
i should remind hon. members that it is contrary to the rules to refer to the absence of members from the Chamber .
i would ask hon. members to bear that in mind in the course of their remarks .
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the last member gave us a history lesson .
let us just review very quickly some of the history since 1993 . We nearly lost Canada in a Quebec referendum .
we are $ 100 billion deeper in debt .
there are $ 26 billion in increased taxes .
youth unemployment stands at 17 % .
patronage appointments abound everywhere .
we have job equity .
the deception is that somehow our financial problems have been fixed although we have a $ 50 billion interest payment .
now comes the most severe tax grab that we have ever had where the tax will be raised from 5.6 % to 9.9 % of a person ' s income .
to show the total disrespect for democracy , we now have closure being used on this bill that affects almost all Canadians .
let us go back in history to 1966 when this experiment in socialism was started .
let us talk about the pension plan as hon. members across the way want to keep talking about it .
let us talk about young people .
they are the people who are going to be affected by this the most but let us also include seniors who have children and grandchildren .
we are going to destroy the incentive of these young people .
we are going to rob them of their jobs because of these payroll tax deductions .
the small businessman is going to be put further down the line and his chances of survival are that much less .
during the last election I made up a little card .
this little card refers to exactly what this plan is all about .
i talked to many young people , particularly , in the workforce at their places of work .
i said to them " Let us think about what this plan is really about .
at the end of that time you will get $ 8,800 provided you don ' t have too high an income .
if you have too high an income the government is going to claw it back from you .
maybe what you are doing is really investing $ 3,300 a year for 35 or more years to get nothing '' .
what would be a better way ?
obviously , a better way would be to take that $ 3,300 and invest it in almost any kind of securities or program if it was compulsory .
if it was at only 6 % , at age 65 that very same person would have a $ 275,000 nest egg and would have an annuity that would pay $ 26,000 until death .
what kind of investment are we asking our young people to make ?
we are asking them to be robbed .
we are asking them to be part of this deceptive scheme that will take six years to implement .
let us come to the present .
all of us in this House had better dedicate ourselves to making sure that the electorate knows what kind of robbery this is for our young people .
i would like to read some quotes .
i really think these are fitting .
this is just terrible .
this time we are talking about a major piece of legislation .
shame on those Tories across the way for using closure '' .
Mr. Speaker , with all respect I must quote you on April 23 , 1993 from Hansard when you said " This is not the way to run Parliament .
Mr. Speaker , we agree with you totally .
i tell you , they should go up in our caucus room because you are right .
we know that you are close to the people of your riding and to the people of Canada , Mr. Speaker .
that is what the people are saying about this charade that we saw taking place today .
the government will continue to move closure .
that is the sad part about it .
this is just the beginning .
in the last House the government used closure 29 times , the most in the whole history of Parliament .
the last member said " Hey , this is an honourable place '' .
this place has lost its democratic reason to exist .
this place is a disgrace because of those people across the way .
i trust that all of us are going back to our ridings and I trust that the people in those ridings are going to say " How can you shut down debate ?
how can you not listen to us telling you about this robbery that is going to take place of every Canadian ? "
what are the options ?
the government would like us to think that there are none .
but let us just quickly talk about those .
there are many options .
within six years I believe the government will admit it was wrong .
of course it will not be the government at that point but when the government members are sitting across here they will say " That was probably the worst mistake we made in this House '' .
what are the options ?
the options are obvious .
let young people set up a private plan .
let us take a look at what Britain is going to be doing .
it is going to that sort of a plan .
the U.S. is pretty much committed to going to that plan within the next two years .
Australia and New Zealand have already done it .
Chile has been on that plan for 16 years .
let us examine those .
so that the hon. finance minister cannot continue to misquote the Reform position , let us tell people today that all of those people who have paid into the CPP will be paid out in a credit system whereby they will get a prorated pension plan for the years of contribution .
it will take time to phase in this plan but we have to start it now .
all of us know that in time if we stay with the plan we have we will be going back for more contributions , more money , more tax grabs .
we have to look at these options .
we have to present them in the House .
they need to be debated here , but the government has closed down that option .
as we heard from the finance committee they do not even have it in their schedule to discuss this .
when the workers start to realize that their contributions have gone from $ 935 to $ 1,645 , we had better believe they are going to let people know and we better believe they will let the members across the way know .
four years from now it should be time and it should have moved well enough along that the results will be at the ballot box .
in conclusion , today has been a dark day for our country .
all of us on this side of the House had better dedicate ourselves to that job .
Mr. Dan McTeague ( Pickering - Ajax - Uxbridge , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , most in the House , indeed most Canadians , will understand very clearly the commitment that the government made to ensure that down the road we have a pension system that is not only fair to people today , but is fair to those who will need it later .
it is not news to members , certainly on this side of the House , of the wisdom that was shown by the hon. Minister of Finance in providing a new regime that will ensure sustainability of the pension system .
most of us here campaigned on this .
it was an issue we discussed in the last Parliament .
it is very clear at least from the perspective of many members , certainly from Ontario and right across the country , that what we said is what we are about to do .
i have no trepidation in saying that in years to come I will be glad and so will many of my constituents that the benefits and fruits of this nation will be shared for generations to come .
i do not think one has to go too far to understand how we wound up in a situation where the initiative of this government and of several provincial governments who agreed to this formula came about .
the reality is that over the years this was a situation that we allowed to happen .
we simply allowed it to transpire .
we knew that the demographics of this country were changing .
with the benefits of a health care system brought by , in many respects , the father of the hon. member and finance minister , and as a result of the medicare system which this party introduced many years ago , people are living longer .
the standard of living is high , very much as a result of the progress and the initiatives taken by the Liberal Party of which I am a proud member .
in order to sustain that program , in order to ensure that we have a viable pension system , someone had to take the bull by the horns .
i am therefore rather proud of the initiatives taken by this government to ensure the survival of our pension program .
no one in the House will be surprised to know that if nothing had been done by the government in Bill C - 2 , it is conceivable that in a few years the pension system , the program that helps our seniors , the disability benefits , the maternity leave which many , including my wife , take , would not be there .
it would not be there in our time , in our generation , and perhaps even within the life of this Parliament .
when we strip away the politics of all of this , when we take away the partisanship that often clouds a decision that has to be taken , we find that what is being done is necessary .
as members know , I did not take my MP pension .
yet I believe it is very important to understand that most people of our generation would appreciate and would applaud what this government is doing today .
i am pleased to speak to the issue .
i am pleased to speak to the very necessary changes that are about to take place over the next little while .
we are in a period of transition .
it must be clearly understood that , if we want to move into the new decade , the new millennium that is approaching , it is absolutely vital that we recognize problems before they arise .
the provinces that were involved in the negotiations dealing with the changes to CPP earlier this year also recognize and gave approval to the need to move ahead .
i do not think that what we are doing here is extraordinary .
i know there are those who believe that we should be doing other things , that there are all sorts of wonderful proposals out there .
it is far different to be sitting in the opposition knowing that you do not have to take seriously the reality of government than it is to be in a position where you are governing and you have to make decisions that will count , decisions that will stick and decisions that will sustain themselves over the years to come .
we have one of the youngest communities , myself and the hon. member for Whitby - Ajax who I am very pleased to say has done a spectacular job as a member of Parliament and previously as a councillor .
i know we share in the common view that short term pain sometimes means long term gain , but in this instance we are not talking about gain for some .
i think that is what separates us from the opposition , the Reform Party .
we are here to ensure there is a modicum , a standard and a benchmark by which Canadians at the lower end of the economic spectrum will never be let down .
that is a commitment that goes to the core of the Liberal Party .
it is one of the reasons that we also understand that we cannot get mired down in some of the wacky ideas that we can somehow spend our way out of these problems .
we also understand that if we want to sustain and we want to maintain programs that help people in a way that ensures equality , we have to take decisions that are sometimes tough decisions .
members from across this country in years to come , in particular some of the members on the other side who are a little lighter in age as I am - well , I do have until next week at which point the age of wisdom kicks in - will appreciate that colleagues of their own , friends of theirs and neighbours will be taken care of and the initiatives taken by this government at this time in our lives helped .
they helped to bring people together , they helped to make sure those people had the very basics .
i noticed a smile from my hon. colleague in the New Democratic Party .
i can say that it is very very good to see so many shining beaming faces .
it is great not to be a rookie .
i know that hon. members in the short term will be very happy after the next election because I am sure that a pension will not be too far away for them .
there will be an opportunity for them to enjoy the very things we are putting forth today .
the economy is growing .
that did not just happen by accident .
we could also compare ourselves with what happened provincially with our counterparts in the province of Ontario who believe that to slash and burn is the way to go about things and at the same time wind up at the end of the day continuing to perpetuate a deficit .
we chose the balanced approach and we found lo and behold after our commitments in 1993 and 1997 that the balanced approach does indeed work .
this is a government and a minister that are prepared to seize the agenda for the future and to seize an agenda that puts in its first instance all the interests of Canadians , particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society .
i was just told by the member for Whitby - Ajax that that is the Liberal way .
i could not put it more eloquently and I terminate on that .
let us move ahead with this bill .
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this bill , an act to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment board and to amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts .
in February of this year , the Minister of Finance introduced in this House the first version of the legislation on the Canada pension plan .
its provisions were improved through the observations and comments made .
the changes put forward by the federal government were approved , as the act provides , by at least two thirds of the provinces representing two thirds of the population of Canada .
in all , eight provinces , including Quebec , approved the proposed changes .
only British Columbia and Saskatchewan abstained .
bill C - 2 , which the Minister of Finance introduced on September 25 , provides for a reform of the Canada pension plan , among other things .
there are three main thrusts to the reform .
the first is to increase funding of the system , to take it from two to five years , as proposed by the minister .
the second thrust is to maximize the rate of return through the establishment of a Canada pension plan investment board . >
finally , the bill will change certain benefits , such as disability benefits .
the Minister of Finance expects all these changes to take effect on January 1 , 1998 .
in order to assess this reform , let us take a brief look at the history of the Canada pension plan .
it was established in 1966 , and nine provinces joined , Quebec having its own retirement pension plan , the Quebec pension plan , commonly known as the QPP , which , incidentally , is also under review .
the Canada pension plan pays out approximately $ 17 billion a year in benefits .
this amount includes survivor and disability benefits .
the value of the pension fund is equivalent to 2 years benefits , or roughly $ 39 billion .
of course , this reform will have far - reaching effects on the premiums paid by those contributing to the Canada pension plan .
while being strongly in favour of this legislation , I must say that the reform affects Canadians more than Quebeckers , since very few Quebeckers get CPP .
as of last August , there were between 12,000 and 13,000 Quebeckers in this situation .
the latter will be easier to achieve through the Canada pension plan investment board .
this board is essentially similar to Quebec ' s Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement , except that it will not have any economic mandate .
its primary responsibility will be to achieve the best possible rate of return , so that today ' s young people stand a better chance of enjoying a retirement pension .
moreover , having a reserve equivalent to five years of benefits instead of just two will provide a major fund with more money than is currently the case , thus ensuring that Canadians , and particularly people of my generation , will receive retirement benefits when the time comes .
to begin with , we all agree that premiums will increase under this plan .
these increases will be absorbed in part by my generation .
will young people also see a decrease in their pension benefits ?
given comparable premiums in constant dollars , will the pensions young people receive on retiring be comparable to those of people now receiving benefits under the plan ?
i would like these questions to be addressed , for there is a cloud hanging over intergenerational equity .
as party critic , and as a young person myself , I find it interesting that the focus is on the future to ensure that future generations will have the same rights as today ' s generation .
to give a better idea of where I am coming from , I would like to describe briefly the situation facing this country ' s youth .
each year the rate of unemployment is somewhere between 16 and 17 % and the activity rate for young people between the ages of 15 and 24 is dropping .
the Bloc Quebecois is strongly in favour of responsibility for youth employment programs being returned to Quebec and will do everything in its power to bring this about .
i have said this over and over again , and I will keep saying it for the rest of this Parliament .
because of the Conservatives ' successive restrictions on unemployment insurance and the Liberals ' employment insurance reform , fewer young people are able to take advantage of this program .
this is yet another reform that served present generations in the past , but that will be inaccessible to my generation in the future .
employment insurance , as it is now known , is a measure that is almost completely inaccessible .
there are , of course , certain interesting adjustments , but for seasonal workers or young people graduating from university , this reform is completely inaccessible .
in addition , the principle followed by the Liberals with regard to premiums is simple : hold the line on premiums but cut back on accessibility .
increases in tuition fees are the result of cuts to provincial transfer payments for post - secondary education that were imposed by this government .
finally , poverty is an ever - increasing problem .
i am greatly concerned about the future , about environmental questions , about a lot of issues , but one in particular which this House must discuss , namely the widening gap between the rich and poor .
for some years now , since 1980 , in fact since the fall of the Berlin Wall , we have seen that capitalism is growing by leaps and bounds .
the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer , with the government across the way and its reforms , particularly the employment insurance reform , which is impoverishing the poor still further .
this is cause for concern .
this is probably one of the consequences of the notion of the global village , the world market , which makes it easier for the rich to get richer , and more easily .
markets are opening up increasingly toward Asia .
i am sounding an alarm , and I believe that considerable thought must be given to this .
i think we shall be able to find a way out , but at what price ?
tenacity and perseverance will be needed .
what I wanted to show with my speech is that the Bloc Quebecois is not here to oppose anything that moves , everything the government does .
on the contrary , we are delighted with the pension reform .
as a member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development , I shall make it my duty , along with my colleagues , to ensure that all the reforms will apply equally to the coming generations and that everyone will be able to benefit from these services .
Mrs. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to participate in the debate to amend the Canada pension plan .
in Etobicoke - Lakeshore there are many seniors who have written , who have spoken with me and who have attended consultation meetings where we discussed the changes and the need for changes to the Canada pension plan .
the plan is a primary source of income on which many Canadians rely in retirement .
indeed , Canadians are greatly concerned about any changes to the plan which might have an adverse effect on their economic stability .
as members of Parliament , it is our duty to ensure that the financial future of all Canadians is secure and that Canadians will continue to have confidence in the Canada pension plan .
the Liberal government is taking the responsibility for the future direction of the plan seriously by initiating the proposed changes .
the changes are reflective of the Liberal government ' s belief in assisting , providing and protecting those in need .
i support Bill C - 2 , the legislation to amend the plan because that legislation will ensure that we have an improved and effective public pension plan that protects individuals in retirement .
in an age where a wide variety of financial instruments are available to Canadians to prepare for retirement , not all Canadians can afford or have the protection of RRSPs .
experts on CPP have drawn the government ' s attention to the fact that in light of national realities such as an aging population , the decline in population growth , that the plan needs to be tailored to match the demographic realities of our country .
we are facing up to the demographic realities by securing the future of the CPP .
the proposed changes were the result of a lengthy consultation process with provincial and territorial governments , professionals in the actuarial and insurance professions , representatives of social planning organizations , seniors , young people and other Canadians .
it has been established by repeated government studies that payouts lagged behind the contributions .
we need to have payouts and contributions in line so that Canadians can have a plan beyond the year 2015 .
this means that in order to maintain the current benefit structure , contribution rates need to increase by 14 % of income by the year 2030 .
under the legislation , marginal increases to contribution rates will be slowly phased in over a seven - year period .
contributions will be increased by .4 % of income this year and will go to 9.9 % of income by the year 2003 as compared with the current rate of 5.85 % .
as evidenced , the increase in contribution rates will not be dramatic and therefore Canadians can have a secure CPP that is affordable .
i would like to reiterate the facts of the proposed changes that the hon. Minister of Finance has given on numerous occasions in the last Parliament and which are echoed in this Parliament by many colleagues .
my constituents would like to hear that current benefits such as CPP retirement pensions , disability benefits , survivor benefits or combined benefits are not affected by the amendments in Bill C - 2 .
any Canadian over age 65 as of December 31 , 1997 who elects to receive CPP as of this date their pension will not be affected .
likewise all benefits under the CPP except death benefits will be fully indexed to inflation .
if Canadians choose to retire at age 60 or 65 or up to age 70 , these ages of eligibility for retirement will remain unchanged .
these are the principal tenets of the CPP that will remain intact .
as the government embarks on rebuilding a sound CPP plan , Canadians who are not now in receipt of CPP need to know that there will be future changes .
future beneficiaries who will be in receipt of retirement pensions will see a change in benefits because calculations will be based on five years of pensionable earnings instead of the current three years .
benefits for these applicants will be calculated based on the applicant ' s maximum pensionable earnings at the time of disablement instead of at age 65 .
i know that these are issues that many of us deal with in our constituency offices .
changes will be made to payments of death benefits .
CPP contributors will continue to receive death benefit payments under the plan , but again the benefit will continue to be based on six months of retirement benefits .
they will see a decrease and this decrease is due to the fact that we want to address the problem of income disparity by ensuring that low income Canadians are not adversely impacted by the proposed changes .
these proposed changes to the CPP will ensure that Canadians will continue to have an economically viable and stable pension plan that meets their future retirement needs .
the intent of these changes is to give us better options and to ensure the viability of the plan .
i call on all members at this point in time to support this initiative for the benefit of all Canadians .
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment as deputy chairman of the committees of the whole House .
i would also like to take the opportunity to thank the people in my riding of Acadie - Bathurst for their support and their trust in the June 2 federal election .
their support underscores their belief in the government management and the importance of an open democracy , and I will certainly not discuss this today .
Acadie - Bathurst has a population of nearly 100,000 people of all ages and interests .
its linguistic attributes , with anglophone and francophone populations , mark it as a particular spot in Canada .
mining , forestry and the fisheries are very active and the main driving force of the local economy .
natural resources are however very unstable .
the pulp and paper industry has experienced certain difficulties .
nevertheless , things in this industry are on a better footing these days .
the fishing industry is not so well off .
since 1984 , fishing has produced little , and this situation has had an alarming effect on communities .
as things currently stand in my region , the future looks vulnerable and difficult .
this is why I wish to react to the changes proposed to the Canada pension plan .
bill C - 2 proposes increased contributions , the creation of an independent agency to administer the plan and a reduction in benefits to those least well off in our society .
in his press release on the new bill , the Minister of Finance said that the changes would ensure the plan ' s long term viability , while making it fairer and more affordable for future generations of Canadians .
the Minister of Finance has an odd sense of fairness .
he is targeting Canada ' s most vulnerable people - older women and people with a disability - in favour of his friends on Bay Street in Toronto .
the New Democratic Party finds this option unacceptable .
we will not go for the Liberal and Reform Party position , which would increase inequity within Canadian society .
the NDP believes that the voters must be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system .
the people of Canada are the ones who will have to live with these changes .
they must be given an opportunity to express their views .
when one is elected to this House , one is supposed to be able to participate in the debates , and I am really ashamed of what has happened here today .
it makes it more difficult to qualify for disability benefits and imposes stricter rules for combining disability and survivor benefits .
under the existing legislation , one must have worked during at least four out of the past six years to be eligible for CPP disability benefits .
if this bill is passed , one will be required to have worked during two of the past three years or five of the past six to be eligible for disability benefits .
with the proposed changes , some people who are currently eligible would no longer be eligible .
another problem is the whole issue of survivor and death benefits .
at present , the maximum is set at $ 3,580 for a person receiving survivor benefits .
these have been reduced to $ 2,500 with the maximum being frozen , and this will be especially harmful to widows and separated women who live alone for a longer time .
the year ' s basic exemptions , the first $ 3,500 of earnings , is no longer indexed to inflation which means that the low income workers , many of whom are women , would have to pay more in contributions .
the bill also includes amendments to the CPP ' s financial provisions and changes the plan into an additional tax and a make - work project for bankers , who are good friends of the Liberals .
this rapid increase in the contribution rate is a concern for several reasons .
first , the CPP will be refinanced at the expense of low income people , particularly women .
to shift responsibility for refinancing the CPP to those who are least able to do so , as our Liberal friends are proposing , is irresponsible and will have a harmful impact on future generations .
creating an environment that makes the underground economy more attractive is harmful to all Canadians , and this concerns me a great deal .
however , the Liberals are not telling us that the board will not have the mandate to promote investments in our domestic economy .
i support job creation programs , but I have a serious problem when I see that friends of the Liberals , namely bankers , are the ones who will benefit , while ordinary Canadians are still waiting for the Liberals to fulfill their commitments and create jobs for them .
this government keeps promising jobs for all Canadians , but its proposed changes to the CPP ' s financial provisions mean more power for the big wigs and more hardship for ordinary people .
let me give an example .
why does the government accept that , when an accident occurs in the workplace , the CPP provides benefits for the injured worker , instead of the workers compensation board ?
it is a way of abusing the system and still keeping an eye out for their friends .
we must also come to the defence of the universal public pension system .
an older population does not mean we must adopt an individualized approach or that we must privatize our public pension system .
on the contrary , our European friends offer good examples of societies with older populations that now have public pension plans .
the Liberals have manufactured a crisis around the CPP in order to be able to attack the concept of the universality of our pensions and to save money on the backs of society ' s weakest members .
the Canadian public pension system is a crucial part of the Canadian social security net .
the CPP and the OAS have been particularly important for lower and middle income seniors .
it embodies the values Canadians share and ensures a fair redistribution of wealth .
thanks to public pensions Canada has made tremendous gains in overcoming poverty among senior citizens and has provided much better prospects for retirement with dignity .
in the three decades since the CPP was adopted , the poverty rate among Canadians 65 and older fell to 10.9 % in 1995 from 33.5 % in 1980 .
the battle against poverty among seniors is far from over .
today one of every five elderly persons still lives in poverty .
in 1993 the poverty rate for seniors increased over the previous year in almost every province .
Scaling back CPP and OAS benefits will hurt low and middle income seniors .
we have a responsibility to present and future senior citizens to oppose this legislation and protect our public pension plan .
the health of the CPP is directly tied to the rate of economic growth and a good level of employment , which increases the government ' s revenues .
this government ' s many cuts , high interest rates , the present high rate of unemployment , and modest incomes have done more damage to the CPP than the aging of the population .
it is terrible to see a government that calls itself democratic refusing to let the debate continue , in this House , to get to the bottom of things .
it is unacceptable .
we were elected to this House to debate legislation .
the CPP is of real importance to all Canadians , and the Liberal government turned its back on them today by refusing to allow the debate to continue .
that is regrettable .
what the Government of Canada has done today is truly shameful .
Mr. John Maloney ( Erie - Lincoln , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to be able to join in the debate on the Canada pension plan .
in February of this year the Liberal government acting with the provinces took the lead to place the Canada pension plan on a solid financial footing .
we should not forget that the plan is jointly managed by the federal and provincial governments , and changes can only be made to it if approved by two - thirds of the provinces representing two - thirds of the population .
the reforms are supported by Newfoundland , Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , Prince Edward Island , Quebec , Ontario , Manitoba and Alberta .
the consultation process was very extensive .
during the 33 sessions held in 18 cities throughout the country , more than 270 formal presentations were held to find out what Canadians thought should happen to their plan .
Canadians had no hesitation .
they asked to have the plan preserved , its finances strengthened and its investment practices improved .
those who advocate scrapping the CPP and moving to a privatized system with mandatory retirement savings plans do not understand two things .
first , Canadians want the CPP to remain .
second , the CPP provides protection not available through private RRSPs , such as disability benefits , provision for women of childbearing age and survivor and death benefits .
the CPP premiums are insurance premiums paid by working Canadians into a public pension plan from which they draw benefits when they retire .
to insinuate otherwise by calling the rate increase in contributions a tax grab is misleading and confusing .
the CPP revenues are not revenues of the Government of Canada .
the fund is jointly administered by the federal and provincial governments for the benefit of citizens , not for the benefit of governments .
critics who maintain that the CPP is an insufficient public pension plan conveniently forget that it is only one of three pillars of our retirement system .
the old age security and guaranteed income supplement system and private retirement savings plans such as RRSPs are the other two pillars .
action has already been taken by this government to consolidate the OAS and GIS into what we call the proposed seniors benefit which is designed to help those most in need .
taken together , these systems provide a good balance of government and individual responsibility for retirement income security .
these changes in the CPP reflect the long held Liberal values of providing stability for and protecting those in need .
it is a balanced approach .
today the 5.85 % legislated CPP contribution rate is shared equally between employees and employers .
however the chief actuary of the CPP indicated that without these changes the CPP fund would be depleted by the year 2015 and contribution rates would have to increase to 14.2 % by the year 2030 to cover escalating costs .
clearly the CPP was not sustainable and something had to be done .
the federal and provincial ministers agreed on a three part approach to restore the financial sustainability of the CPP and make it fair and affordable for future generations .
they did this by moving to fuller funding by accelerating contribution rate increases now so they will not have to exceed 10 % for future generations .
we have come in at 9.9 % They are improving the rate of return for the CPP fund by investing it prudently and by having a diversified portfolio of securities at an arm ' s length from the government .
they are slowing the growth in costs by tightening the administration of benefits and changing the way some are calculated .
speaking about fuller funding , when the CPP was introduced in 1966 it was financed as a pay as you go system .
the prospects of rapid growth in real wages and labour force participation promised that the CPP could be sustained and remain affordable .
as well , building up large reserves in a world of real low interest rates would not have been much help .
the pay as you go CPP system made sense given those circumstances .
since then however the slowdown in wages and workforce growth and higher real interest rates have completely changed the circumstances in which the CPP must be financed .
the pay as you go financing is no longer fair , appropriate and possible .
building up a larger fund , fuller funding , and earning a higher rate of return through investment in the market will help pay for the rapidly growing cost that will occur once baby boomers begin to retire .
accordingly the CPP will move from a pay as you go financing system to fuller funding to build up substantially larger reserve of funds .
the fund will grow in value from about two years of benefits currently to about four or five years of benefits .
indeed contribution rates will rise in steps over the next six years from the current rate of 5.85 % to 9.9 % of contributory earnings and then remain steady , instead of rising to 14.2 % by the year 2030 as projected by the chief actuary .
in dollar terms an employee earning $ 35,800 a year now pays about $ 945 in annual contributions .
however by 2030 an employee would be paying $ 565 less a year than if we had not acted now .
at present the CPP has a fund equal to about two years of benefits .
funds not required immediately to pay benefits are invested in non - marketable provincial government securities .
fuller funding of the CPP means that the fund will grow substantially from about two years of benefits to about four or five over the next two decades .
a new investment policy is required to secure the best possible return for contributors .
a higher investment return on the fund will keep contribution rates down .
thus our ministers have agreed that the CPP funds will be invested in a diversified portfolio of securities in the best interests of contributors and beneficiaries , much like private sector plans .
the fund will be managed professionally at arm ' s length from government by an investment board accountable to both the public and government through regular reports .
the board will be subject to investment rules similar to other pension plan funds in Canada .
the foreign property limits of the pension funds will also apply to the CPP fund .
when the provinces now borrow from the CPP , they will pay the same rate of interest that they do on their market borrowings .
this is a very welcome step .
let us review some of the changes to the benefits and their administration I indicated earlier .
the formula for adjusting previous earnings in calculating retirement benefits will be based on the average of the year ' s maximum pensionable earnings over the last five years instead of the three currently , prior to starting the pension .
the amount of the pension will continue to depend on how much and for how long a person contributes to that plan .
to be eligible for disability benefits , workers must show greater attachment to the labour force .
they must have made CPP contributions on earnings over $ 3,500 in four of the last six years prior to becoming disabled .
prior to 1987 disabled coverage was available to those who had contributed for at least five of the last 10 years .
retirement pensions for disability beneficiaries will be based on the maximum pensionable earnings at the time of disability and then fully price indexed to age 65 .
this measure is consistent with how other CPP benefits are calculated and will apply only to the people not yet over the age of 65 .
the option of eliminating the benefit was rejected .
stewardship and accountability was a concern that has been responded to .
to improve stewardship for the CPP and provide for more accountability so that the sustainability of the CPP will no longer be at risk has been accomplished as follows .
federal - provincial reviews will be required every three years instead of every five .
any future improvements will be fully funded .
there have been criticisms to which I would like to respond .
some say these payroll taxes are job killers and why are we planning on increasing the CPP contributions by almost 70 % over the next six years .
governing is about making choices and sometimes these choices are difficult .
if the CPP is going to be there for young generations , we have no choice but to start paying our way for the CPP now rather than passing on an insupportable burden to our children .
as I pointed out , if we did nothing , CPP contributions would rise to 14.2 % by the year 2030 .
unlike the CPP contributions that are a savings toward pensions , EI premiums are an additional payroll tax that finance current expenditures .
we have also said that we will bring down the EI premiums as soon as and as fast as it makes sense , and we are doing that as well .
this legislation represents a significant step forward to fulfilling our commitment to a secure Canadian retirement income system .
these changes will strengthen our pension system so it will continue to give Canadians the opportunity to build sufficient incomes for their retirement .
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my party is profoundly disappointed with the lack of vision demonstrated by the government with Bill C - 2 .
as such the government reduced payroll taxes , reduced general taxation and reduced regulations on small business .
it has achieved a reduction of 15 % to the extent that now in the Netherlands the unemployment rate is less than 7 % .
this demonstrates what vision and leadership can provide to Canadians and what we need to do to ensure the sustainable growth of the Canadian economy .
i come from a small business background .
most of my family has been in small business for the last three generations .
one thing we recognize in small business is when we only have so much coming in , in terms of general revenue , we can only afford to do so much with that amount .
it is not a limitless pit as the government might feel .
it stands to reason when payroll taxes are increased small businesses will not be able to hire as many people as they would otherwise want to hire .
subsidies designed by the government to entice people toward particular actions and to move them in particular directions are the exact opposite of taxes .
this in itself should demonstrate to the government that reducing payroll taxes would help stimulate growth in the Canadian economy .
bill C - 2 and the $ 11 billion tax grab on ordinary Canadians without reducing employment insurance premiums will create further impediments to job growth .
this is unacceptable to Canadians , especially to young Canadians .
when I speak to the students with whom I went to university and hear their stories of graduating with degrees and significant student loan debts , my heart goes out to them .
i feel very badly for their circumstances .
while the government through words says that it shares this pain and wants to do something about it , when given the opportunity to act decisively it consistently fails to demonstrate the vision these young people need .
trade is a tenet of our party ' s policy .
it is something that we have been consistent on in terms of supporting the values of free trade .
this will create a further disincentive to the creation of jobs .
we are a trading nation , yet we have higher payroll taxes than our major trading partners .
perhaps this explains why we in Canada have over twice the unemployment rate of the U.S. We have a significantly higher unemployment rate than that of the U . K . We have three times the unemployment rate of Japan .
how will young Canadians move forward with a government that continues to hold them back ?
bill C - 2 is another example of a government that does not trust its own people to make decisions with its own money .
when government takes money from people through taxation , it is essentially saying that it is in a better position to determine what to do with that money than the individuals .
the government has demonstrated unequivocally that they have not earned the right to make those decisions .
in this day and age we have an opportunity through history to learn the lessons of economics , especially the economics over the last 30 years .
it demonstrates without hesitation or equivocation how taxation or any barrier placed by government on small and medium size business , especially in a trading environment , prevents jobs .
this government cannot claim ignorance to these facts .
i find it unacceptable that this government continues to move in this direction without recognizing this .
my constituents and in particular the small business community have expressed this to me .
i come from Atlantic Canada where many small businesses are struggling to survive .
they would very much like to expand and hire more people but this government continues to put barriers in their way to this type of job growth .
flexibility of the workforce is very important .
we have not yet been able to convince this government and instead of listening and responding to the needs of Canadians and to basic economic truths , it is going to ram Bill C - 2 through this House and continue to force Canadians to endure longer sustained high unemployment in this country .
we do believe in ensuring a sustainable future for the Canada pension plan .
there are some members of this House who do not think it is important to protect 225,000 disabled Canadians through the Canada pension plan .
however we recognize that the Canada pension plan is an important vehicle for those people in our society who need us to provide a level of support for them because they cannot provide that for themselves .
for many Canadians the single biggest difficulty that lies in front of them is a government that refuses to allow them access to the tools of job growth .
small business , especially a small business that is involved in international trade , is going to be and should be the engine of job growth in this country .
why this government insists on preventing small business people and young people from taking their rightful place in the international business community instead of providing them with opportunities to succeed and to ensure that future generations of Canadians are successful , we do not understand .
it takes courage sometimes to make the right decision .
it takes vision and it takes a level of understanding and intelligence .
we sincerely hope that the Canadian people in the next election will try to seek the type of leadership that will provide Canadians with this type of government .
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is an honour and a privilege to rise in this House and speak to an issue that I believe was of concern to all of the residents of Thornhill , the young and the old .
as I begin , I would like to tell this House a little bit about the riding of Thornhill .
Thornhill is a newly created riding , created by redistribution .
for the very first time since the 1970 s , we see Thornhill put back together again .
the provincial government had divided Thornhill .
if one visits the riding one will find that old Thornhill straddles both sides of Yonge Street , part of it in the town of Vaughan and part of it in Markham .
now for the very first time with the creation of the new federal riding of Thornhill , Markham , Vaughan , Concord and all of the wonderful communities within those entities have come together under the name of Thornhill .
Thornhill is a vibrant riding with many businesses .
i have to say that the businesses are very aware of the need for fixing the Canada pension plan and the problems that have plagued the Canada pension plan for many years .
each one who works in a business or who owns a business understands the importance of the Canada pension plan to Canadians and to Canadian values .
within Thornhill is a very young community .
as I knocked on doors and met people from all over the world , one of the things that was clear was that people in Thornhill are concerned about whether or not we will have in place in the future programs and plans like the Canada pension plan to protect them when they get sick and need disability insurance .
many were aware of the problems that have existed for some time with Canada pension plan .
many were aware of the need for the plan to be fixed .
i approached Bill C - 2 from the following perspective .
the first question I asked was , is there a problem ?
the answer to that question is yes , there is a problem .
the problem is not a new one .
it has existed for a long time .
we could stand , we could point fingers and we could say " During the years of the Conservative government it did nothing to fix the plan '' .
that would not be productive , although it would be true .
the response of the government has been that there is a problem .
what did it do about that ?
it did two things .
the first thing it did was consult Canadians to make them aware of the problem .
the people of Thornhill are very aware that there are problems with the Canada pension plan .
they are aware that if it is left untouched and unchanged , the plan will implode .
it will not be there for future generations .
it is important that these questions be answered .
not only did the government consult widely with Canadians , it also sat down with the provinces .
while the Canada pension plan is a federal pension plan in the eyes of the people , the reality is that it is a federal - provincial plan .
changes can only occur if a majority of the provinces approve and recognize that a significant majority of the people of this country approve the changes .
in other words the federal government could not unilaterally make these changes .
to those constituents in Thornhill who , when I knocked on their doors , said " Isn ' t it possible for governments to work together , " I say to them and to everyone in the House that Bill C - 2 is an example of governments working together .
was it unanimous ?
absolutely not .
did they get a national consensus ?
yes , I believe the governments did .
a majority of the provinces , including Ontario , representing a significant majority of the population of Canada , have signed an agreement to make changes to the Canada pension plan that will solve the problem .
the plan will be fixed and I will be able to say to the next generation , to the young people of Thornhill and to the young people of Canada , that the Canada pension plan will be there for them in future generations .
that is the commitment of the government and that is what Bill C - 2 accomplishes .
it fixes a problem that has been identified and it ensures that the plan is viable into the future .
the next test and the next question that I asked on behalf of the people of Thornhill was " Is this done fairly ?
is it done with accountability to the people who rely on this plan and want to know that it is there ? "

stony RESERVE - SPEAKER ' S RULING
the Speaker :
i am now ready to rule on the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Wild Rose on September 30 , 1997 , concerning information allegedly denied to him by an official of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs .
first of all , I want to thank the hon. member for Langley - Abbotsford , the leader of the official opposition in the House of Commons , as well as the hon. member for Fraser Valley for their contribution to this debate .
in his submission , the hon. member for Wild Rose claimed that an official of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs had deliberately misled him and subsequently denied him information .
this , he argued , constituted a contempt of Parliament .
according to the hon. member , on September 16 he was invited to a meeting with the departmental official to receive a progress report on the Stony reserve , a reserve located in his riding .
citizens of the Stony reserve apparently accompanied him .
at some point during the meeting he was made to leave by the official because it seemed that he was not entitled to certain information that was about to be disclosed .
when he raised the question of privilege in the House , the hon. member stated that he had requested this meeting to obtain information which he contended was directly related to the preparation of a question which he wanted to ask the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development .
he added that he had given notice to the minister of his intention to ask such a question .
on October 2 the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development made a statement to provide additional information on this question of privilege .
this was followed by further comments from the hon. member for Wild Rose , the leader of the official opposition , the hon. member for Fraser Valley and the hon. member for Langley - Abbotsford as well as the hon. member for Wentworth - Burlington .
the Chair always takes any matter concerning the privileges of members , particularly any matter that may constitute a contempt of Parliament , very seriously .
as Speaker Fraser noted in a ruling given on October 10 , 1989 found at page 4457 of the Debates :
- the Speaker does not rule on whether a breach of privilege or a contempt has in fact been committed .
the Speaker only determines whether an application based on a claim of contempt or breach of privilege is , on first impression , of sufficient importance to set aside the regular business of the House and go forward for a decision by the House .
before proceeding , the Chair feels that it might be helpful to explain to members , and especially to new members of this House , the difference between a contempt of the House and a breach of privilege .
as stated in Erskine May , 21 st edition , at page 115 :
generally speaking , any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament in the performance of its functions , or which obstructs or impedes any member or officer of such House in the discharge of his duty , or which has a tendency , directly or indirectly , to produce such results may be treated as a contempt even though there is no precedent of the offence .
privilege , on the other hand , can be divided into two finite categories : the rights extended to members individually , and those extended to the House as a collectivity .
as for the rights and powers of the House as a collectivity they may be classified as follows : the regulation of its own internal affairs , the authority to maintain the attendance and service of its members , the power to expel members guilty of disgraceful conduct , the right to institute inquiries and to call witnesses and demand papers , the right to administer oaths to witnesses , and the authority to deal with breaches of privilege or contempt .
when claiming that a certain action constitutes a breach of privilege , members must specify which of these privileges is affected .
the hon. member for Wild Rose argued that the actions taken by the official from the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs constitute a contempt of Parliament .
technically , obstructing members in the discharge of their responsibilities to the House or in their participation in its proceedings is considered to be a contempt of the House .
as Joseph Maingot writes in his book Parliamentary Privilege in Canada at page 73 :
in the 21 st edition of Erskine May it is stated at page 125 :
correspondence with constituents or official bodies , for example , and the provision of information sought by Members on matters of public concern will very often , depending on the circumstances of the case , fall outside the scope of ` proceedings in Parliament ' against which a claim of breach of privilege will be measured .
in instances where members have claimed that they have been obstructed or harassed , not directly in their roles as elected representatives but while being involved in matters of a political or constituency related nature , Speakers have consistently ruled that this does not constitute a breach of privilege .
on April 29 , 1971 Speaker Lamoureux , in a ruling on a question of privilege concerning rights of members to visit penitentiaries at page 5338 of the Debates stated that :
parliamentary privilege does not go much beyond the right of free speech in the House of Commons and the right of a Member to discharge his duties in the House as a Member of the House of Commons .
- the classic definition of a question of privilege does not fit circumstances in which a Member in his duties outside this House finds that his scope is being restricted or attempts are being made to restrict his scope of intervention and effective work on behalf of not only his own constituents but his point of view as a Member of the federal parliament .
on the matter of a member ' s constituency duties , Speaker Sauv 茅 pointed out in a decision delivered on July 15 , 1980 , at pages 2914 and 1915 of the Debates :
- whatever duty a Member has to his constituents , before a valid question of privilege arises in respect to any alleged interference , such interference must relate to the Member ' s parliamentary duties .
after careful consideration of the precedents , I conclude that activities related to the seeking of information in order to prepare a question do not fall within the strict definition of what constitutes a " proceeding in Parliament " and , therefore , they are not protected by privilege .
let me now turn to another aspect of the matter before me .
i concur totally with Speaker Fraser when , in a ruling on March 17 , 1987 , at page 4262 of the Debates he emphasized that " The extent of the application of any law is a question that the courts should be asked to decide and not the Speaker '' .
in the same decision Speaker Fraser further stated : " The Speaker ' s duty is confined to interpreting the procedures and practices of the House of Commons '' .
may I draw members ' attention to citation 168 ( 5 ) of Beauchesne ' s sixth edition , at page 49 , which states " The Speaker will not give a decision upon a constitutional question nor decide a question of law '' .
furthermore , I wish to remind the House that it is not up to the Chair to comment on the behaviour of public servants in the performance of their duties .
in order to fulfil their parliamentary duties , members should of course have access to the information they require .
on the other hand , they should be aware of the constraints under which public servants must operate when providing information .
the Chair is mindful of the multiple responsibilities , duties and constituency related activities of all members and of the importance they play in the work of every member of Parliament .
however , my role as your Speaker is to consider only those matters that affect the parliamentary work of members .
the hon. member for Wild Rose has explained that this matter touches upon his preparation for questions to the minister .
i accept the hon. member ' s statement just as I accept the minister ' s explanation of the events .
there is clearly a dispute about the facts of the case and it does not fall to the Speaker to settle that dispute .
i have concluded that this case constitutes a grievance on the part of the hon. member , but since this situation has not actually precluded the hon. member from participating in a parliamentary proceeding the Chair cannot find that a case of a contempt of parliament has occurred .
i thank the hon. member for Wild Rose for his intervention and for bringing this matter to our attention .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i listened with interest to your ruling on the subject .
you mentioned that the member for Wild Rose has a grievance , but you ruled that he did not have a case for contempt of parliament .
the Speaker :
as a general rule once a decision has been given it should just rest where it is .
a Speaker ' s ruling is of course not appealable .
in this particular case I will make an exception .
if the hon. member has a grievance he should pursue it in my view with the minister .
i am now prepared to deal with the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre on October 1 relating to the premature disclosure and subsequent publication of a preliminary draft of a committee report .
standing COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRY - SPEAKER ' S RULING
the Speaker :
the hon. member contends that in the last Parliament a preliminary draft report of the Standing Committee on Industry was divulged .
she states that while the industry committee ' s fifth report was tabled in the House on April 25 , 1997 , the Department of Industry ' s response to an access to information request shows that on April 18 , 1997 industry department officials were in possession of a preliminary draft of the report .
let me first deal with the question of whether a breach of privilege that occurred in a previous parliament can now be taken up and dealt with by this House .
Erskine May ' s 20 th edition makes clear , at page 168 , that a breach of privilege in one parliament may indeed be punished by another .
this is reflected again in the ruling of Speaker Jerome on November 9 , 1978 which reaffirms the principle unequivocally .
the Chair can therefore entertain the question raised by the hon. member .
in her presentation , the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre argued that the privileges of the House have been breached in so far as the preliminary draft report has been divulged prior to its presentation to this House .
i want to thank the hon. member for bringing this matter to the attention of the House as well as the government House leader and the hon. member for Winnipeg - Transcona for the assistance they have given the Chair .
in my view this is a matter of utmost importance .
since the standing committees of the House are holding their organization meetings and beginning their work in the 36 th Parliament , this is also a most timely issue .
it reminds us all of the responsibilities members assume when they serve on committees of the House .
as I stated in my ruling of February 15 , 1995 on a similar matter , confidentiality is a key issue for committees .
members of committees and ministers working with committees have an obligation to ensure that they themselves and those whose expertise they seek , be they personal assistants or departmental officials , respect the confidentiality of their documents and the integrity of their deliberations .
committees must address their work processes and be very clear about how they expect draft reports and other material relating to in camera meetings to be treated .
everyone present at such meetings , including officials from departments and agencies , must realize their obligation to respect the confidentiality of the proceedings they witness and the material they may therefore be privy to .
in a report tabled in the House on December 18 , 1987 the Standing Committee on Elections , Privileges and Procedure recommended that :
committees should make clear decisions about the circulation of draft reports - .
equally , committees should give careful consideration to the matters that should be dealt with in camera and matters that should be discussed in public .
that being said , however , the Chair has often expressed its reluctance to interfere in the affairs of committees unless difficulties arising in the committee are put before the House by way of a committee report .
i refer members especially to the ruling of Speaker Fraser given on December 7 , 1991 , which can be found at page 4773 of the Debates .
in that ruling he stated :
according to our traditions and practices , the Chair does not intervene in the proceedings of a committee unless a problem has been reported by the committee to the House or in extremely unusual circumstances .
after careful review I have concluded that the present case is not one that compels the Chair to deviate from this well established practice , for it does not introduce any new element to the body of precedent in these matters .
if after examination a committee were to present a report recommending that this issue required further consideration , the House would have the opportunity of considering the issue at that time .
the Chair has concluded that there is no breach of privilege in this instance and that it is not appropriate for the Speaker to intervene at the present time .
as committees take up their work in this new Parliament , I know that all hon. members will be conscious of the responsibility they have been entrusted with and will strive to respect the traditions of this place .
on a point of order , the hon. member for Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre .
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the time you have taken to study this matter and to bring down the ruling to the House .
i am not sure all the issues were considered .
perhaps you could respond to this in an answer for me .
with respect to the issue of committee in camera minutes , the Chair may or may not be aware that committees are now destroying in camera minutes at the end of parliament .
therefore there would be no evidence of any decisions taken in camera by a committee on an issue because the minutes would have been destroyed .
we would have no record of what exactly happened .
is this part of the decision or part of the input , or would this be grounds for the Speaker to intervene in the business of committees whereby they do not destroy the minutes but keep them on record ?
the Speaker :
with regard to the business of committees , the committees generally set up the rules under which they are to work .
as for evidence being carried over from one parliament to another , the Chair must deal with the evidence that is put before the Chair .
if this evidence does not exist then the Chair cannot rule on it one way or another .
did it ever exist ?
i guess that is another point that could be discussed at some further time .
however , for the time being the Chair must , on the basis of the information that is put before it in whatever case , make a decision at that time .
if there is question about how a committee proceeds , I suggest to all hon. members the matter should be raised in committee so that they provide for this information to be available one way or another , if they feel it is needed at some future time .
routine PROCEEDINGS
interparliamentary DELEGATIONS
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , on behalf of the hon. member for Mount Royal and pursuant to Standing Order 34 ( 1 ) , I have the honour to present to the House , in both official languages , the report of the Canadian group of interparliamentary union which represented Canada at the 1997 interparliamentary conference held in Seoul , the Republic of Korea , from April 9 to April 15 , 1997 .
again on behalf of the hon. member for Mount Royal and pursuant to Standing Order 34 ( 1 ) , I have the honour to present to the House , in both official languages , the report of the Canadian group of interparliamentary union which represented Canada at the specialized interparliamentary conference on the close partnership between men and women in politics held in New Delhi , India , from February 14 to February 18 , 1997 .

income TAX CONVENTION IMPLEMENTATION ACT , 1997
hon. Jim Peterson ( for the Minister of Finance ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 10 , an act to implement a convention between Canada and Sweden , a convention between Canada and the Republic of Lithuania , a convention between Canada and the Republic of Kazakhstan , a convention between Canada and the Republic of Iceland and a convention between Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and to amend the Canada - Netherlands Income Tax Convention Act , 1986 and the Canada - United States Tax Convention Act , 1986 .

criminal CODE
i am introducing two private members ' bills today , both dealing with the Criminal Code .
the first one deals with protection of the child before birth .
this is not an abortion issue but deals with an extremely serious issue occurring in our country .
this bill is a last ditch resort and is an attempt to ensure that women who continue to take substances that are injurious to their unborn children can be put into a treatment facility against their wishes if necessary .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
* * *
criminal CODE
madam Speaker , again pursuant to the standing orders and seconded by my colleague and friend from Nanaimo - Alberni , I am introducing a private members ' bill dealing with the Criminal Code and violent offences .
essentially this is a three strikes and you are out bill .
this bill is designed so that if an individual commits three violent offences , the courts must incarcerate that person for life imprisonment .
the purpose of this bill is to target individuals who have clearly demonstrated to the Canadian public that they willfully disregard the basic essence of respect for another person ' s life .
i hope we will find agreement in this House to pass this bill sometime in the near future .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
* * *
income TAX ACT
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 244 , an act to amend the Income Tax Act and the Canada pension plan ( transfer of income to spouse ) .
unpaid work is still work and deserves to be compensated for its contribution to our society .
this bill would allow spouses to split up to $ 25,000 of income between them so that one could stay at home and care for preschool children .
it would allow that income to be eligible for RRSPs as well as extend eligibility for Canada pension plan benefits .
i am very pleased to rise to reintroduce this bill .
i look forward to debating this issue and earning the support of my colleagues throughout the House .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
* * *
criminal CODE
Mr. John Finlay ( Oxford , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 245 , an act to amend the Criminal Code ( penalties for sexual offences involving children ) .
enactment of this bill would ensure that the definition of publication in the case of child pornography covers transmission by electronic means or posting the material on the Internet or any other electronic net .
it also provides for an increase in the maximum punishment of imprisonment for life with no parole eligibility for 25 years if guilty of sexual assault on a child under eight or on a child under 14 who is under the offender ' s trust and authority or dependent on the offender .
it also provides for an increase in the maximum penalty for forcible confinement from 10 to 14 years in the case of a parent or ward who confines a child and thereby harms the child ' s physical or mental health .
i look forward to the support of my colleagues on this bill .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
* * *
public SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION ACT
madam Speaker , I am pleased and honoured again to reintroduce this bill which would establish a registered charitable trust fund for the benefit of families of police officers , firefighters or other public safety officers who are killed in the line of duty .
the fund is proposed to be administered by an independent board that would be set up to receive such money , gifts or bequests and to determine awards on the basis of need .
Canadians are aware of the risks that face our police officers , firefighters and public safety officers on a daily basis as they serve our emergent needs .
when one of them loses their life in the line of duty , we all mourn that loss .
this fund would be a tangible way to honour their courageous service and to assist their loved ones in their time of need .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
* * *
criminal CODE
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 247 , an Act to amend the Criminal Code ( genetic manipulation ) .
the purpose of this bill is to ban the cloning of human embryos .
i believe it is important to set limits within which science can develop in the service and the best interests of all .
medically assisted reproductive techniques give rise to a number of questions : ethical , moral , religious and scientific .
there may be much debate still to come on how these techniques will be monitored but there is , I believe , a broad consensus on the necessity of banning the cloning of human beings .
yet there is no legislation at the present time to reflect that desire .
over and above science , medicine and politics , human cloning is also a question of human dignity , which transcends all partisan politics .
for this reason I am asking all members of this House to support this bill , which reflects the will of those who elected us .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
* * *
organ DONORS
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , pursuant to the standing orders I put forth a motion dealing with an epidemic in our midst , the crisis of organ donations in the country .
this motion if adopted by the government would enable us to save the lives of hundreds of people in the country who are waiting for organ donations , some of whom are in the House today .
i hope the government will adopt it as a votable motion and will pass it forthwith .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the House has heard the terms of the motion .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
( motion agreed to )

questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand .

some hon. members :
agreed .

request FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE
government BILLS INTRODUCED IN SENATE
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I wish to advise the House that I have written to the Speaker this morning seeking leave of the House to introduce a motion in accordance with Standing Order 52 , for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter requiring urgent consideration .
i refer to the fact that two bills have been introduced in the Senate by the government and will be considered by the Senate before being considered by the Commons .
while I recognize that this is an established practice , this practice in today ' s Parliament is outmoded and offensive to our democratic principles since the Senate is unelected , unaccountable and unrepresentative of the people of Canada .
three of the five parties in this House of Commons are not represented in the Senate at all .
in addition the party which represents the opposition in the Senate represents less than 7 % of the elected members of the House .
i believe that the procedures set out in Standing Order 52 will enable members of the House to immediately debate and communicate to the government that the upper house cannot be expected to fulfil the role of sober first thought since the senators represent a political composition which is a reflection of the past and , in particular , a reflection of patronage appointments of the defeated governments of Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney .
the Speaker ' s attention to this matter is appreciated .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the Chair thanks the hon. Leader of the Opposition for his remarks .
the Speaker received a letter from the hon. member expressing his intention to raise this matter .
after careful consideration the Chair concludes that the application does not meet the terms of the standing order .
government ORDERS

allotted DAY - FEDERAL PARTY FINANCING
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) moved :
that this House condemns the attitude of the Government , which refuses to introduce in - depth reform of the legislation on the financing of federal political parties even though the existing legislation allows for a wide range of abuses .
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron ( Verch 猫 res , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I believe that you will find unanimous consent in the House on the following motion :
that at the conclusion of the present debate on the Opposition Motion , all questions necessary to dispose of this motion be deemed put and a recorded division be deemed demanded and deferred until Tuesday , October 21 , 1997 , at the expiry of the time provided for Government Orders .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to so move ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the House has heard the terms of this motion .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
( motion agreed to )
Mr. Gilles Duceppe :
madam Speaker , I will share my time with the hon. member for Laurentides .
this is the first opposition day for the Bloc Quebecois and the issue is the financing of federal political parties .
it is all the more relevant in the current context , given the influence peddling allegations involving employees of the Liberal Party of Canada and of the government .
for about two weeks now , the opposition has been putting questions to the government , but the ministers either refuse to answer or give evasive or contradictory answers .
at the very beginning , no one knew anything .
i am convinced that , in the days or weeks to come , we will learn that the whole cabinet knew , except of course the Solicitor General who , I am sure , was not aware of the case .
this is somewhat surprising since in the Airbus case , which came to its conclusion this week , the then justice minister told us that , in such cases , the Solicitor General , not the Prime Minister , had to be informed first .
this was the rule as they explained to us by referring to many precedents and to past practice .
today , everything is changed .
let us set the record straight .
on March 6 , the Minister of Human Resources Development informed the RCMP of a possible case of influence peddling .
he also told the Prime Minister , or his office - which amounts to the same thing , for when the Prime Minister ' s chief of staff is informed of something , he immediately tells it to the Prime Minister .
he told the Minister of Public Works and Government Services , and the President of Treasury Board .
the investigation began in mid - June , three months later .
as you know , a general election was held in Canada during that period .
one wonders whether an election would have been called so early if allegations or revelations had not been made to the RCMP .
was it not therefore in the government ' s interest to call an election quickly ?
alternatively , one wonders whether the investigation was postponed until after June 2 to avoid any embarrassment to the Liberal Party of Canada during the election campaign .
these two questions come to mind , given that the human resources minister said he informed those concerned .
just who were those concerned ?
he also notified the President of the Treasury Board , not in his capacity as President of the Treasury Board but as the federal minister responsible for Quebec .
one can wonder if it was not in the interest of the Prime Minister , who won his election , winning by a very narrow margin in his riding of Shawinigan , to keep this matter under wraps during the election campaign .
one can also wonder what position it would have put them in if the Liberals had had to explain why they were using the same financing methods as the Conservatives , whose methods they denounced time and time again when in opposition .
but they are using the same methods , as we have seen in this case .
Quebec may not be unique with respect to financing .
i can just imagine the Minister of Public Works and Governmental Services explaining during the election campaign that his government ' s code of ethics is different from that of the Liberal Party of Canada .
he stated that the Liberal Party was required to comply with the Criminal Code .
the reverse would have been surprising .
the fact is we are not sure any more , since these allegations were made .
when they talk about their code of ethics , we must ask ourselves : what ethics ?
it is like the Lourdes or Fatima secret .
revelations are made about something that is never made public .
we are aware of the existence of a code , but not of its contents .
it is also surprising that the matter was not submitted to cabinet to ensure government integrity .
i am surprised because we are dealing with a system that connects the federal government to the Liberal Party of Canada as far as financing is concerned .
the Minister of Human Resources Development told us that confidential lists are handed over to the ministers responsible for the various regions .
the minister responsible for Quebec , who is also the President of the Treasury Board , told us , although this was said outside this House , he received confidential listings not only from Human Resources Development Canada but also from other departments .
he had more to say outside the House , but what he said was nonetheless interesting .
a member of the minister ' s staff is under investigation , yet the minister does nothing .
that is surprising .
he did nothing yesterday and nothing today .
we might ask whether the President of the Treasury Board is the godfather of the government .
we might ask .
we might also ask whether his department is the clearing house for influence peddling , which can only be explained by the weakness of federal legislation on the funding of political parties .
the deputy minister did not act in order to protect government integrity .
the Prime Minister did not think it wise to inform the other ministers of the danger that threatened the government as the result of the actions of his party .
the leader of the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister are , until proven otherwise , one and the same person .
what one knows , the other should know .
this is why the federal government should turn to the laws of Quebec for inspiration .
they came and told us how much they loved us , spending all the money they wanted .
this morning , the Supreme Court of Canada invalidated the Quebec referendum act , while the federal government , sitting under the weight of allegations , has no such legislation .
we can see that the Supreme Court , biased as it is , is under the control of a regime that puts partisan interests before ethics .
that is where things are at today .
hon. Don Boudria :
madam Speaker , on a point of order .
i believe it is contrary to the Standing Orders of this House to comment in this way about a Canadian court , and especially about Justices of the Supreme Court .
according to Beauchesne ' s rules , these sorts of statements are inappropriate -
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
what section ?
hon. Don Boudria : - and I would ask the Chair to consider the matter .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i would ask all members to temper their remarks .
in the past , under Standing Order 18 , there were rulings to the effect that members were not to criticize court rulings .
resuming debate .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe :
madam Speaker , I refer to Beauchesne , something I do rarely so as not to trouble the House .
it says clearly , in citation 493 , that :
- all references to judges and courts of justice of the nature of personal attack and censure have always been considered unparliamentary , and the Speaker has always treated them as breaches of order .
this is not a personal attack , but a collective one .
it is as simple as that .
i think that the farce now taking place -
> the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member , but I must give the floor to the hon. member for Scarborough - Rouge River .
Mr. Derek Lee :
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i was shocked to hear the words of the leader of the party opposite .
the words that have been used here today are , at a minimum , contemptuous of the Supreme Court of Canada but they also potentially undermine the entire legal system in this country .
they undermine the federation .
i would like to ask the party leader who spoke these words to withdraw them .
in the absence of a withdrawal I think he must , like a child , carry these words with him for a very long time .
i am not prepared to sit here and have the Supreme Court of Canada trashed in this House .
i would ask him to consider withdrawing and speaking in a more temperate fashion about our high court .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
once again , I urge members to be temperate in their remarks .
resuming debate .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe :
madam Speaker , if I understand correctly , there were two minutes remaining to me before the interruptions .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i do not think so .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe :
look , I was interrupted by two points of order .
it would be an easy matter to raise a series of points of order throughout someone ' s speech so as to prevent him from speaking .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
we have not lost that much time .
you may certainly conclude your remarks rapidly .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe :
madam Speaker , as long as I have more than five seconds .
what I said this morning , given the serious allegations hanging over the Liberal Party of Canada , over the government , was that it seems to me that there is an urgent need here for legislation similar to that in Quebec so as to ensure that democracy does not have a price tag attached to it , that we do not find ourselves with a system in which financial interests are more important than the expressed wishes of voters , a system in which a court would hand down anti - democratic rulings in Canada , the world ' s greatest country , a system in which money , not democracy , rules the day .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , knowing the leader of the Bloc Quebecois ' leadership problems , he is obviously looking for something to rally his gang around him .
and what a lovely sight it is to see them all flocking along behind him this morning .
if the head of the Bloc Quebecois and the leader of the party are one and the same person , I would have some questions to put to him .
first of all , does he agree with this ?
second , is it true , as is alleged , that the Bloc Quebecois might possibly have received funds from financial institutions that are not individuals ?
can the leader of the Bloc Quebecois tell me whether he has received considerable amounts from certain banks , that is corporate entities and not individuals ?
Mr. Gilles Duceppe :
madam Speaker , if I understand correctly , we are speaking of the 1988 election of Mr. Lucien Bouchard , when he was in the Conservative party .
is that indeed what we are speaking of ?
it is quite possible that things were going on within the Conservative party of the time , as there are within the Liberal party .
Mr. Bouchard has changed , unlike the hon. member for Bourassa , who ran against me in 1990 .
it took him three or four tries to get himself elected here .
i remember when he was passing himself off as the reincarnation of Jean - Claude Mal 茅 part , over the Mal 茅 part family ' s objections .
banks have never been shown to be supporters of the Bloc Quebecois .
that is public knowledge .
moreover , when the reports will have been submitted for this campaign - I do not have them myself , since they were all completed on October 2 and we have until December 31 - my colleague will be able to see for himself that the Bloc ' s rules apply .
however , let us not confuse matters .
there may have been loans against a line of credit , but that is not a donation .
it is something very different , and I can tell you that the loans are being paid back .
such accounting details may be too complicated for my colleague for Bourassa , however .
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) :
it does not surprise me that this government is acting in this way and we cannot expect anything different from it .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe :
madam Speaker , this is not the time to be talking about Bill C - 2 .
we are talking about another very important matter today , the financing of federal political parties .
i would like to hear the views of Reform members on this issue .
as long as we do not have an act similar to the one which exists in Quebec , we will have situations like the present one where there are allegations of influence peddling on behalf of the Liberal Party of Canada and maybe the office of the President of Treasury Board , someone of some importance within the government .
you could say he controls the purse strings .
moreover , he is the federal minister responsible for the province , an interested party , as the hon. Minister of Human Resources Development was saying .
Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) :
Madame Speaker , I am happy to speak today in this House .
unfortunately , the buzz word in the House these days seems to be " influence peddling '' .
all the more so that there is presently in my riding a hotly debated issue which could literally burn the Liberal government since it could involve once more , influence peddling and partisanship in its organization .
it is about the much criticized relocation to the neighbouring town of Saint - Antoine - des - Laurentides of the employment centre that has always been located in Saint - J 茅 r 么 me , the economic capital of the Laurentian area .
but to really understand what is involved in this case , it is essential to go back over the events from the beginning .
the CEC has always been located in Saint - J 茅 r 么 me ' s downtown core .
in 1991 , after the public works department accepted the bid of the property management company RAMCO D 茅 veloppement Inc. , the latter invested $ 1.7 million to expand its building located in downtown , so it could accommodate the Saint - J 茅 r 么 me CEC and meet the department ' s requirements .
how peculiar .
members will agree that this is where the problem lies .
why extend the location perimeter of the CEC ' s premises ?
why does the federal government feel compelled to get involved , with its not so subtle approach , and without any concern for the development priorities established by the locals ?
in this regard , on July 26 , the Rivi 猫 re - du - Nord RCM undertook to review its development plan in an interim control resolution , which provided , and I quote : " That any new government or quasi government service be established in downtown Saint - J 茅 r 么 me '' .
the resolution was passed by a majority of the mayors of the Rivi 猫 re - du - Nord RCM on September 17 .
the Minister of Human Resources Development was in fact made aware of this in a letter from Gaston Laviolette , the mayor of the municipality of Bellefeuille and the reeve of the Rivi 猫 re - du - Nord RCM and Marc Gascon , the mayor of the city of Saint - J 茅 r 么 me .
despite the relevance of their remarks , the minister turned a deaf ear .
on the strength of this we can assume that the minister has no sense of what is involved in regional development , since this is what it is all about .
here again , nothing came of the contact .
unable to meet the Minister of Human Resources Development , I took the initiative of stopping him in the Liberal ' s backroom .
after hardly a word was said , the minister , who was already on the defensive , made it clear he did not want to hear anything about partisan politics in the matter .
however , after I added new facts , which , I add , disagreeably surprised him , he changed his attitude to some extent and assured me that he would look into the matter and would get back to me about my concerns .
however , I still have heard nothing from the minister .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
the member is to address the Speaker and not the minister directly .
some hon. members :
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i would ask the hon. member to address the Chair .
Mrs. Monique Guay :
to come back to the issue at hand , Madam Speaker , even the director of the employment centre deplores the minister ' s decision .
he told us that he had always been very satisfied with the quality and service of the premises and that he wanted to stay in the building located at 222 , Saint - Georges Street , in downtown Saint - Jer 么 me .
according to the director , the visibility and pre - eminent location of the employment centre are essential to serve Saint - J 茅 r 么 me and the surrounding area and especially the other cities served by Saint - J 茅 r 么 me following the streamlining of the employment centres by the minister .
now , adding insult to injury , the minister wants to relocate the centre to the outskirts of downtown Saint - J 茅 r 么 me , which is the economic capital of the Laurentides region .
the centre ' s director was very blunt on one point : if it were relocated in Saint - Antoine - des - Laurentides , the centre would lose all of its present high profile .
the support I have received to prevent this move does not end there .
on September 19 , 1997 , Mrs. Louise Harel , Quebec labour minister , wrote a letter to the Minister of Human Resources Development , asking him for a moratorium on this move since it goes against the spirit of the Quebec - Canada agreement in principle on manpower training , which is aimed at making both federal and provincial service points more accessible , not less so as is the case here .
as of September 10 , the minister had only received an acknowledgement of receipt of her letter .
with regard to the firm RAMCO d 茅 veloppement Inc. , its president , Mr. Jacob A . Attias , is rightly surprised and mostly quite shocked by he lack of transparency of the Liberal government ' s process in the matter of moving the CEC out of its present location .
in 1991 , RAMCO d 茅 veloppement spent $ 1.7 million to add to the building in order to make room for the employment centre .
Mr. Attias had even offered to lower the rent by close to 30 % .
to add insult to injury , RAMCO had agreed with Public Works to invest a further $ 120,000 to upgrade and renovate the facilities in order to better meet the department ' s requirements .
one can imagine how Mr. Attias feels after such an experience .
not only is this businessman being overtaxed , he is being literally fleeced and taken for a ride by the very people who manage his taxes .
this is totally outrageous and despicable .
given all these facts , I am entitled to believe and to say that partisan interests or influence peddling are behind this unjustified and unjustifiable move .
the more I talk about the issue , the more I wonder .
since it is practically impossible to meet the Minister of Human Resources Development and to shed light on this vital issue for the socio - economic development of the Laurentian region , I urge the minister to take into consideration the questions that follow and to provide me with answers as quickly as possible .
first , why does his department not comply with the will of our community ' s stakeholders to have public services grouped together in the downtown core of Saint - J 茅 r 么 me , as clearly stated in a resolution from the RCM of Rivi 猫 re - du - Nord on interim control ?
second , why does his department totally disregard the very high level of satisfaction of its managers with the current location of the employment centre ?
in both cases , that is the move of the Saint - J 茅 r 么 me employment centre and the RCMP investigation , we find the same silence which truly gives us the impression that someone from that party has a guilty conscience .
if Liberal Party ministers or employees made mistakes or did not comply with a basic code of conduct , they will , sooner or later , have to pay for their mistakes , because no one will trust them any more , and rightly so .
as elected representatives , members of Parliament are accountable to the public .
however , and I deeply regret having to say this , there seems to be a blatant lack of accountability and transparency on the part of certain individuals working for the federal government .
i move :
that the motion be amended by deleting the word " in - depth " and substituting the following therefor : " complete '' .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the motion is admissible .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , Saint - Antoine - des - Laurentides is in the Laurentides riding .
the member for Laurentides complains because the government of Canada decided to keep that centre in her riding ; she will not stop complaining .
is the owner of that building a close friend of the member ?
given the allegations and the fabrications we have heard , would I be wrong in believing there is something in the wind ?
they are defending that owner too diligently .
they should be happy because a reasonable decision was made to keep the centre in the region , in the riding .
the member should rather be thankful since many ridings , even ridings of government members , have lost their employment centre .
her riding kept its centre .
Methinks the lady doth protest too much .
Mrs. Monique Guay :
madam Speaker , the member for Bourassa shows how narrow - minded he can be .
one should not speak about an issue when one knows nothing about it .
as far as fabrications and allegations of friendship between the owner and myself , if the member had truly listened to my speech he would know that this is a regional decision , that there was a regional consensus and that this government is , once again , disregarding decisions made at the regional level and agreements reached regionally .
this government makes partisan decisions , such as the one to relocate an employment centre for some good friends .
that is the situation .
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I listened to the speech of the hon. member and I have a couple of questions .
first , we have read in the paper that knowledge of what was going on was given on March 6 and it took until after July 12 to surface .
has the hon. member any idea why it took so long for this to come forward , other than something to do with the government ?
second , does the hon. member think this only happens in the province of Quebec or does this happen in the other provinces ?
Mrs. Monique Guay :
madam Speaker , I thank the member for his question .
i do not want make any accusations , except that decisions were made , of course , to move some employment centres to other areas , probably to satisfy certain people .
these decisions went against the opinion regional or local stakeholders had voiced at the time .
what we are asking this government to do is to make decisions that go along with the wishes expressed by the local or regional stakeholders and to stop playing party politics with these issues .
on one hand , it signs nice Canada - Quebec agreements for employment centres and , on the other hand , the two offices end up being located three or four kilometres apart .
how are we going to offer services to people who have no car , who must travel , who will have to go to one place and another , while trying to cut costs , to reach a consensus ?
a senior federal official is negotiating with Quebec so that the two offices , the employment centre and the unemployment office , are as close as possible and even sometimes share the same location .
this is a totally illogical decision .
i hope some ministers who are here today will think about this so that this decision can be reversed and that , next time , before making similar decisions , they will think and consult .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to take part in this debate today .
let us remember , in spite of what we have been hearing for the last few minutes , that the text of the motion that we are debating with a minor amendment proposed a little earlier reads as follows :
that this House condemns the attitude of the Government , which refuses to introduce in - depth reform of the legislation on the financing of federal political parties , and so on .
since this morning , the Bloc has been making all kinds of allegations against one person or another , sometimes even against constituents of ridings represented by Bloc members or other parties .
they are using this motion as a pretext to do so .
for my part , I intend as much as possible to limit my comments to the motion before the House .
after all , that is what the House is dealing with .
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
you can ' t possibly do that .
hon. Don Boudria :
i am sorry this displeases the hon. member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot .
anyhow , I still intend to restrict my comments to the debate and to the motion before us , at least as much as I can .
it continues to be the envy of many countries .
our electoral system has been imitated elsewhere .
it is the envy of several countries in the world , as I just said .
it tries to balance public and private financing and allows rich people - there will always be some - as well as people coming from more modest backgrounds , myself included , to run for election and to sit in the House of Commons .
we expect candidates and political parties to raise funds from private sources by presenting policies that Canadians wish to support .
the candidates present their platform and ask people to contribute to the financing of their election campaign .
in my opinion , the system works .
furthermore , in recognition of the importance and of the role political parties and candidates play in our democratic system , a portion of public funds is earmarked for elections .
two major funding tools exist for providing that funding .
in part there is the reimbursement of election expenses .
we are familiar with how that system works .
there is the tax credit for political contributions .
i want to explain that for a couple of minutes .
with respect to candidates , the reimbursement provided is 50 % of the candidate ' s expenditures , providing that the candidate receives at least 15 % of the votes .
in my riding , none of my opponents obtained 15 % of the votes .
consequently , they lost the deposit I just described .
as it pertains to political parties , they receive 22.5 % of the reimbursement .
there is a condition which was added during the last Parliament .
i was a member of the committee which brought the change , which is that a party that has official status must receive 2 % or more of the number of valid votes cast at an election or 5 % of the votes cast in any individual riding where the party has a candidate .
this amendment was brought forward by an hon. member of the Reform Party during the last Parliament .
the committee agreed that it was a valid amendment .
i believe that member is now the House leader for the Reform Party .
it was a good amendment and we approved it .
political parties may accept contributions if the parties have registered status .
they may issue receipts year round for tax credit purposes .
candidates , on the other hand , may only issue receipts once they have filed their nomination papers .
at election time each candidate also issues receipts for the period after filing their nomination papers .
those receipts are issued by our respective financial agents .
there are a number of other restrictions .
a person who is not a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident in Canada cannot make a contribution , nor can a corporation or an association that does not do business in Canada .
this is to ensure that it is Canadians who fund the Canadian electoral process .
foreign political parties or governments or trade unions with no bargaining rights in Canada are also prohibited .
although there is no limit on the size of any contribution , candidates and political parties are restricted in their use of such funds by the limits which are in place at election time .
there is a further restriction , which is that the tax credits , once a certain amount is reached , become null and avoid .
in other words , if someone makes a further contribution they do not receive a tax benefit .
the members of the Bloc Quebecois , this morning , are saying that the system must be changed and replaced by a system where political parties will not allowed to receive contributions from corporations .
i see that the member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot is saying that , yes , that is precisely what they want .
the Lortie commission , an important commission which published a report on electoral financing - I have a copy of the report here , but of course I cannot show it to the camera - made several recommendations .
i must point out to you that the commission has recommended neither that only individuals be allowed to make contributions nor that a maximum be established for contributions .
it is important to note that the commission , which is non - partisan - I hope nobody says that the Lortie Commission is partisan - , never made such recommendations .
i see some members opposite making light of the recommendation of the Lortie commission .
however , it is important for us to note a few things .
the Bloc is pontificating today .
indeed , the Bloc leader told us earlier that his party does not take any money from companies .
however , some of the Bloc members here in this House today have received corporate contributions .
a good many of them .
there were 27 corporate contributions during the 1993 election .
some of the members who are sitting here , looking at me , received some of those contributions .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
name them .
hon. Don Boudria :
an amount exceeding $ 10,000 .
i think it is worth mentioning .
so when you want to preach , as some of the members opposite are doing , you have to be very careful .
the funding system for political parties in Canada is simple .
it is basically a good system .
i can tell you that we will do everything in our power to keep it good and honest .
allegations like the ones being made by the Bloc do not help to improve democracy in Canada .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
hon. Don Boudria :
we have to keep working to improve democracy in our country and avoid taking part in a discussion like the one the Bloc Quebecois wants to hold today .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
give us some names and figures .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I have many comments to make on the biased and twisted speech just delivered by the hon. member .
the first thing I ask him is to give us the names of those who received company contributions .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
and the amounts .
an hon. member :
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
nobody in the Bloc received contributions from companies .
and do you know why ?
because we are following the lessons of Mr. L 茅 vesque , who thought that , by respect for the people and to better serve the people , big businesses , banks and trust companies should not finance political parties .
i think that Mr. L 茅 vesque was right .
the list of contributors to the Liberal Party of Canada includes the six major banks , which gave more than $ 40,000 .
for their part , trust companies contributed more than $ 35,000 each .
in that situation , nobody will be surprised that the government cannot muster enough political will to act when asked to fix the tax loopholes which allowed family trusts to transfer $ 2 billion in the United States without paying taxes .
how does the hon. member dare say that his government can represent each and every citizen when it is being bribed by big business and refuses to take the necessary actions to fix the tax loopholes -
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold :
that is true .
Mr. Yvan Loubier : - but maintains privileges -
Mr. Denis Coderre :
point of order , Madam Speaker .
the member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot is always full of baloney .
he is talking about bribes .
he should know that he must show respect to this institution and to all parliamentarians .
and when -
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i think members on both sides of the House should be more careful in their choice of words .
i would ask you to please continue the debate calmly and peacefully .
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron :
madam Speaker , I think all my colleagues here in this House heard the derogatory remarks made by the member for Bourassa , who called the members of my party hypocrites .
this word being unparliamentary , I call on you to ask the member for Bourassa to withdraw that remark .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
in this case , I will check the blues , but I would ask you once again to remain calm .
the member for Sainte - Hyacinthe - Bagot has the floor .
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
madam Speaker , I will repeat my question since I was interrupted .
how can the member claim to be serving ordinary Canadians when his party is being bribed by large corporations and banks to the tune of $ 40,000 in donations to the Liberal Party of Canada ?
how can this government not have its hands tied by all this generosity on the part of corporate Canada ?
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron :
its hands are tied .
hon. Don Boudria :
madam Speaker , I want to say two things .
first , any small business in my constituency that wants to make a contribution to my election compaign has as much right to do so than any individual .
i do not claim otherwise .
the members opposite claim they do not take donations from corporations when they actually do , and that is what is not right .
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
we do not .
some hon. members :
we want names .
an hon. member :
liar .
hon. Don Boudria :
second , I want to tell you about my own campaign .
each year , my constituents make contributions to the election campaign .
recently the finance minister visited my constituency and 344 persons came to listen to his speech .
that is how I finance my election campaign .
and I can tell you now that my association has $ 100,000 in its election fund .
i have no qualms about it ; I say so publicly .
each and every one of them made a contribution .
they bought a ticket , some even bought two , to come to my fundraiser .
tickets cost $ 100 , including $ 35 for the dinner and $ 65 for the contribution .
that is how I financed my election campaign and that is how I was elected to this House .
some hon. members :
hon. Don Boudria :
i am not ashamed to say this .
i am not ashamed to appear in front of my constituents .
the accusations made by the hon. member opposite are irresponsible .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
half goes to Corbeil and the other half to the other one .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I congratulate you and wish you well .
i wonder if you are ruing the day you got the appointment to be in the chair .
i would like to enter the debate today on the motion .
the House leader from the government talked about one part of the motion , financing federal political parties .
i would like to talk about another phrase which may upset him , the phrase about the existing legislation that allows for a wide range of abuses .
i think that is what we need to look at here today .
i would like to thank the voters of Edmonton North , the new constituency in which I ran in this past election .
it was an honour for me to win the election and to voice their concerns on the floor of the House of Commons .
i would also like to pay tribute to the voters in the now defunct riding of Beaver River in northeastern Alberta , those people who took a chance and voted on the first ever Reformer in the House of Commons back in March 1989 .
although I am away from the riding of Beaver River because the electoral boundaries commissioners blitzed that riding in the last election , it was a tremendous honour for me to sit here for several years on their behalf .
i am close to them still in heart and also geographically as I am literally the girl next door in the riding of Edmonton North .
i would also like to pay tribute today to a very special aunt of mine , Reta Yerex , who died of cancer two days ago .
i dedicate my maiden speech in the House of Commons in this Parliament to her .
i want to say to her husband Art and family that I love them and I will do the best job I can do in the House .
she loved me and she supported everything I did .
i want to do this today for her and everything else that I do here also because she is not with us any more .
i would also like to say how pleased I am today to have my mother , Joyce Levy , and my sister Alison Horne with us .
they have watched me grow up .
they have watched me make Canadian history and they are watching me today in the chambers of the House of Commons .
i want to do the best job I can do for them as well .
he is my greatest advisor .
i just want to say thank you , Lew .
i appreciate everything that you have done and will continue to do for me .
i think he is pretty upset right now about some of the ways political parties use and abuse their funding powers .
therefore , I want to say several things in the debate today .
we never have enough time to talk about all the things that we should talk about , but this whole phrase " allowing for the abuse of legislation for federal political parties that can in fact misuse and abuse the trust of the Canadian public '' .
i do not find anything more reprehensible than that .
somebody under the guise of a federal political party that looks as if he is on the up and up should not be able to bully people into making donations .
that is shameful .
we have been addressing this during question period over the last several days and we will continue to address it in question period and every other chance we get .
we want to make sure that this dirt comes to the surface in order to find out what the answers are .
i am not making allegations today .
let us look at the Liberal bagman who is being investigated right now .
he is somebody who raised funds for the Liberal Party .
we have to ask the question :
what was the trade - off ?
what was the free trade deal they were talking about ?
this was even more deplorable than what we have been suggesting the last couple of days and asking questions about .
i thought that was wrong .
in fact , I thought it was not just immoral or unethical , I thought it was illegal for someone who is the Prime Minister of the country .
that is wrong , but it does not seem that the things that he does are wrong .
this letter is going to the Liberal national director stating that the election has been called and it is the time to start rallying Liberals across the country , to get the Liberal message out during the campaign .
it refers to encouraging all Liberal friends to climb on board and show their ongoing personal and financial support .
this came out of the Prime Minister ' s office .
people must not be allowed to do that in government .
signing his name , Jean Chr 茅 tien , from the Prime Minister ' s office , sending out Liberal stuff asking for Liberal money and Liberal donations so they could try to form a Liberal government .
that is not right .
as Her Majesty ' s loyal opposition , which we are proud to be , we will continue to make sure that we hold these people accountable for the abuse of some of the funds .
the timing of these suspicious grants is certainly questionable and we are going to continue to ask the questions that need to be asked .
what about federal political parties that become government and interfere and manipulate some of these arm ' s length groups ?
how about the CBC ?
it is always said here that these are arm ' s length people .
what is at the end of the arm ?
we have a stranglehold on you and we will cut your grants for the CBC .
we will cut your funding for equipment and staff in the Canadian armed forces '' .
it is wrong .
what is at the end of the arm ' s length relationship with the provinces , for instance with health care ?
the government was to fund the provinces 50:50 when medicare came in in 1965 .
now the federal government is down to 10 % cash donations for transfer payments and it is falling fast .
it is a farce and nothing more .
what about Canadian taxpayers ?
how many people have gone around in ridings during the campaign saying " You vote for me and I will get you this , I will get you that .
i will make sure that your company gets a grant . "
surely those days should be far , far behind us .
it is wrong , very wrong for someone to go around a constituency and make promises that if " you vote for me , I will make sure I look after you . "
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
earlier in her comments , the member indicated that she would not mention the Prime Minister ' s name and she did .
she also used the word " illegally " in reference to actions on behalf of the Prime Minister ' s signing .
as well she has imputed that members during the election campaign were going out and soliciting votes in exchange for some consideration which is contrary to the Canada Elections Act .
madam Speaker , all of these items are contrary to the rules of this place and I ask you please to enforce the rules of the House .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
given the nature of the discussion at this time , I think we can give the hon. member a little leeway .
miss Deborah Grey :
madam Speaker , I am not begging for leeway in the House , what I am begging for are answers to the questions that have been raised about some people .
i am not stating that something is illegal .
i am not accusing the member of going around asking for votes .
i am saying that if this type of thing is allowed to happen , as we are talking about in question period right now , surely to heaven the member would like to see it cleaned up .
i do not think he would like his name besmirched anymore that I would like mine besmirched .
we need to make some fundamental changes so that the Canada Elections Act cannot be abused during writ periods .
further , when a government is in full blown operation and is now the victim and its members at arm ' s length in an RCMP criminal investigation , it is wrong .
i do not think the member is very proud of that .
here is a little quiz for the House .
i bet a dime no one can guess .
it was the member for Glengarry - Prescott - Russell in November 1987 .
does that sound like a broken record ?
" integrity and honesty must be restored to the political process , " page 91 in the red book .
i do not think the Liberals have moved on that promise .
i say to the government , do not just tell us , show us .
do not just think about it , do it , do it , do it .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I am all the more pleased since these are my first comments against the official opposition .
we are used to hearing fine speeches , and very emotional ones too , from the hon. member for Edmonton North .
she talked about shameful .
what is shameful is to try to make political capital when you do not have any proof .
it bothers me that in this specific case she used totally incorrect facts without a shred of evidence .
she has attacked the reputation of an honest and outstanding member of the Shawinigan business community .
she should apologize for what she did .
not only does she have no evidence , but she attacked a member of the business community and she sullied a reputation .
to top it off , in with all the falsehoods she has uttered , as a member of Parliament , she has undermined this whole institution .
i can see the Bloc ' s histrionics have started to spread to the Reform Party .
finally , on this issue of the financing of political parties , the hon. member stated that , because a corporation has given us money , we are in the pay of this corporation .
i have a question for her .
since , according to the latest report , the Reform Party received 925 donations from companies , for a total of $ 815,520 , does that mean that the Reform Party is in the pay of those companies that contributed money to the official opposition ?
this is nonsense .
miss Deborah Grey :
madam Speaker , the member talks about me doing this as a violin playing matter .
i hardly think that was the best analogy to use .
i do sing although I am not a violin player , that is for sure .
quite frankly , I do not like the tune he is singing .
he accuses me of incorrect facts .
i am trying to get any facts that I can .
that is what the difficult part is , trying to get facts from the government .
we are trying to get the facts .
when he says that we are bringing this up I have to remind him and jog his little memory that this criminal investigation was launched by the Minister of Human Resources Development .
this was not something I dreamt up during the campaign .
this is not something my party thought would be fun to investigate .
it is his own guy .
he is the one who decided that this should be looked into because he smelled a rat .
i think it is probably a good thing that he did .
i have some concerns about the fact that we did not hear about it until five days after the election was over .
i am not making these accusations , I am asking questions .
if he were in opposition surely he would be doing exactly the same thing .
he accuses me also of shirt rending , Madam Speaker , and I want to give you this assurance .
what we saw on This Hour Has 22 Minutes the other night was bad enough .
i promise I will not be rending my shirt in here .
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I rose on the point of order earlier because as a backbencher I and most hon. members are here to hopefully earn back respect for the role and position of members of Parliament .
in this speech I did not hear things that I felt very good about .
in my view it was an attempt to link partisan party activities and the office of the Prime Minister in ways which could lead to the perception that there was some wrongdoing on behalf of the Prime Minister .
i would suggest to the member , based on information I have received , that the letter from the Prime Minister on the Prime Minister ' s office letterhead to which she has referred in fact was merely an artist ' s rendition of it included in a Liberal Party fundraising package -
an hon. member :
oh , a reasonable facsimile thereof .
Mr. Paul Szabo : - and not in fact a letter from the Prime Minister ' s office which was within his role as the Prime Minister of Canada .
miss Deborah Grey :
madam Speaker , the entertainment just does not end .
he talks about the link that I was trying to make between bringing back respect to the office and this idea of fundraising and linking partisan party activities .
this was not my letter .
this says " Liberal fax transmission from Jean Chr 茅 tien to Terry Mercer , National Director , Liberal Party of Canada '' , and it says Prime Minister ' s office at the top .
so the link has been made .
i think it is wrong .
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to participate in the debate on the Bloc motion which condemns the attitude of the government in that it refused to introduce complete reform of legislation on the financing of federal political parties , even though the existing legislation allows for a wide range of abuses .
before I get into the substance of the debate I wish to take this opportunity , my first opportunity , to thank the constituents and the voters of Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre for electing me to this assembly .
they voted for me in the majority because they felt the work I was doing was important to them and to our country .
i acknowledge their support over the last four years , in particular in the last election , that returned me to this assembly .
i pledged during the campaign to work hard on their behalf to make sure that their voices were heard in parliament .
i will continue to do that as long as I am a member of Parliament .
i also wish to take this opportunity to thank the workers in my constituency who worked hard for me , those who put up signs and made political contributions to my campaign .
i would like to extend my appreciation to my family who sacrificed a fair amount of time , energy and money to see me re - elected .
the issue we have before is a very important one .
it is on the floor of the House of Commons because of developments in Quebec where there were suggestions or allegations of influence peddling .
this is not a first .
we have seen allegations and actually substantive proof and convictions in other provinces of influence peddling and of patronage , whether it is constituency patronage or politicians doing things for money provided to them by sources other than the taxpayers .
we in the NDP believe the regulations which govern party financing in Canada are like hunting dogs that will not hunt .
they are there but they do not do the job they were intended to do .
we believe there must be extensive reform in that area .
we have seen across the country , in particular in Quebec lately , a practice in backroom politics called tollgating .
it is bad politics anywhere .
it is frontier politics that have not seen the light of day very frequently except for Quebec recently .
we have seen examples in Nova Scotia and in Saskatchewan .
the Liberal Party is not the only guilty one .
the Conservatives were very guilty of these practices in the past .
the Reform Party is guilty .
the Conservatives and the Liberals are guilty of influence peddling , tollgating and doing all sorts of illegal things with respect to people ' s money .
we also have members from the Western Canada Concept Party who are now members of the Reform Party that do the same sorts of things .
we want these issues on the floor of the House of Commons to be transparent .
we want political party financing to be changed so that it is transparent and open ; so that constituency patronage and regional patronage end ; and so that tollgating and other such issues end .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
would you ask the member to be intellectually honest in the connections he makes ?
it is a deprecation of the quality of debate in the House to hear him talk like that .
it is wrong .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
that is not point of order .
i ask the hon. member to continue the debate .
Mr. John Solomon :
madam Speaker , members will know that political parties were originally established to advocate ideas based on principle .
they are tied together as political parties on the basis of principle .
we put forward the world view on issues important to people who support our particular philosophies .
the Reform members who are chirping from their seats are concerned about being brought into this debate .
they have track records with respect to some of the issues before the House today .
it reminds me of the old saying that when you throw a rock in the dark and a dog barks , you hit a dog .
i think we have a problem here .
i think the Reform is barking because it has been hit with the same allegations as the Liberal Party .
we have a political process that is still tied to the old slogan of he who pays the piper calls the tune .
the NDP believes there must be an inclusive , fair , transparent political contribution system to include as many people as possible in our democracy .
they can contribute money to a political party and obtain a tax break on their income taxes .
we think there must be an extension of that system .
there has to be a ceiling of contributions from businesses and other organizations so that he who pays the piper indeed calls the tune .
we want Canadians to pay politicians .
we want Canadians to be involved in supporting political parties so that we are accountable to the taxpayers and not to the banks or the oil companies that now run the country .
government must be the balance to the economic powers that run our economy .
the Liberals , the Reform and the Conservatives all believe they should be funded by huge corporations so they can continue to tip the balance against ordinary Canadians and in favour of the large corporations that run our economy already .
i want to provide some evidence with respect to what I say on he who pays the piper calls the tune .
we are not only talking about tollgating , influence peddling and political patronage on a riding or regional basis .
we are also talking more insidiously about political parties financed by corporations doing their bidding in the House of Commons on issues that hurt Canadians .
the best example is the banks .
in 1996 the banks gave a total of $ 544,000 plus to the Liberal Party .
what does this mean ?
we can look at the bank tax rates , the bank services charges and their flexibility in charging interest rates to their customers .
the Bank Act , passed by the House of Commons and supported by the finance committee made up of Liberals , Reform members and former Conservative members , allows banks to do whatever they want .
why ?
i have raised the issue of energy pricing and fair gasoline pricing .
the Liberals , the Reform and the Conservatives opposed it .
why ?
the NDP oppose that 100 % .
we wonder why Bill C - 91 , the drug patent legislation , has not been changed .
we wonder why the Reform and Liberals embrace huge international pharmaceuticals in gouging Canadians on prescription drugs prices .
it is because they get huge contributions of $ 26,000 from Merck Frosst and $ 33,000 from Glaxo .
that is patronage and political party fund raising at their absolute worst .
we in the NDP are committed to ensuring that is ended and ceilings are put on contributions by those organizations .
we will continue to fight in parliament for taxpayers as long as we are here .
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , some things never change in life .
i have been here a long time and a politician in British Columbia a long time .
obviously the member has never read a paper from British Columbia or looked at what happened to his government in British Columbia , the New Democratic Party government .
members who sat in this House who were members of that government were under investigation on charges of abusing public funds , the Commonwealth Nanaimo federation .
that this House condemns the attitude of the government , which refuses to introduce in - depth reform of the legislation on the financing of federal political parties even though the existing legislation allows for a wide range of abuses .
all parties in the House set down the regulations .
we all go through the same list .
if the people who made the abuses by offering to peddle influence are guilty and are charged , they will go to jail .
if any member gets involved , it is unfortunate .
to try to label everybody in parliament with going out at election time to raise money and maybe buy political favours with it is very unfortunate in the Parliament of Canada .
it is a disgrace to the Parliament of Canada that people make these kinds of speeches .
an hon. member :
the truth hurts , doesn ' t it ?
Mr. John Reynolds :
they yell out from the NDP side that the truth hurts .
let us look at the list of donators .
i do not mind .
people phoned me yesterday from my riding .
i had calls from newspaper reporters .
one question they asked me was about donations to the New Democratic Party member .
they said he got $ 8,000 from the union .
he works for MacMillan Bloedel and he was a very credible candidate .
why is it that a union can give $ 8,000 but MacMillan Bloedel cannot give that to a free enterprise candidate ?
the public has a right to know and it is there .
that is the way our system works .
we live in a democratic system where people have a right to make donations to the candidate and the party of their choice .
i hope that never changes .
NDP members might like to see that change .
because of the way they talk about how they would run the country , not too many corporations would give them money .
corporations large or small would not want to give them any money because they would not do the country any good .
let us look at the province of British Columbia which has a New Democratic Party government .
that is the way the system works .
i think it is a good system .
we declare who they are and the public has a right to know .
if the odd time we have a problem like we have across there right now , the police will solve the problem sooner or later .
if anybody in the government is involved in it , they will pay the price .
the system is a good system .
they are a lot different .
when I ran in 1972 and 1974 we did not have to declare any names at all .
we just took in the money and spent it .
there were no limits on spending .
that was not fair .
it kept many people who wanted to run for the House of Commons from getting here .
there were good committees of the House that sat and worked very hard .
the members of the New Democratic Party sat on the committee and recommended the changes we are living under now .
it is unfortunate they had to get up in the House and try to turn this motion around to make it look bad .
it hurts everyone in Parliament .
they are good rules and we should stick with them .
Mr. John Solomon :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to respond to the member by saying that since the last time he was a member in the House of Commons things have changed a fair amount .
the member who is now a member of the Reform Party changes his politics like a dirty shirt .
he was a good friend of Bill Bennett , that upstanding fundraiser who has been before the courts for the last 15 years .
now he is a member of the Reform Party .
i wonder what he will bring to the Reform Party in terms of integrity , in terms of fundraising , in terms of cleaning up the system which exists now , which quite frankly is not in tune with contemporary politics and contemporary thinking in society .
we are saying to the House of Commons and to the people of Canada that the system we have now which provides financing to political parties has to be revisited .
it has to be cleaned up .
here is an opportunity which was provided to us by the Bloc .
i congratulate the Bloc for the motion .
i believe all members should focus on it and work toward that objective .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to indicate that this is my maiden speech in the House .
i would like to give the mandatory congratulations to you , Mr. Speaker , on your appointment to the Chair .
i also want to pay tribute and express my thanks to the people of Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough for entrusting in me this very sacred responsibility .
i certainly will endeavour to represent the people of my constituency in the province of Nova Scotia with vigour , honesty and integrity .
with those words I must say that it is with some regret that I rise to speak on the issue which is before the House .
i want to indicate that I am in support of the motion which has been brought forward by the Bloc .
it is important to look at the origin of this debate .
i want to give thanks to our Conservative member for Richmond - Arthabaska for his hard and diligent work in bringing this matter to the forefront .
i also pay tribute to members of the Bloc and the Reform Party for having the good sense to join us in this open debate concerning government accountability .
the stench of corruption that now hangs over this government is something which we have to deal with in a very timely and effective manner .
this stench exists because of questions surrounding the relationship of ministers of this government and their departmental information and agents of the Liberal Party of Canada .
we need to ensure that campaign fundraising activities are no longer shrouded in obscurity .
because of the outright refusal of the government to deal with the simple , straightforward questions that have been posed to it on the floor of the House of Commons , we have this sudden shroud and feeling of insecurity on the part of people both inside and outside the House .
we need to ensure that the government is moving in the direction of accountability and responsibility .
these are not just words that are thrown around lightly .
i am afraid to say it - and I think we are all aware of the fact - but there is a great deal of cynicism in the general public , a growing cynicism about political practices .
that is why I stress the importance of the timeliness of this debate .
my colleague from Richmond - Arthabaska and I were asking earlier this week what the government has done .
what has the government done ?
the Minister of Human Resources Development we know filed his concerns and complaint with the RCMP back in March .
he did that to ensure , and rightly so , that the practices were not going to continue .
simply reporting it is not enough .
i would stress the importance of the government ' s responsibility to do something more than simply bring this to the attention of the RCMP .
at no time are we asking the solicitor general or any member , any minister of the crown to actually interfere .
we are asking for answers about what they did subsequent to the reporting and what other assurances the House has that the practice will not continue .
as a former crown prosecutor I do agree with the line that the government should not directly partake in an RCMP investigation .
that is standard and it is not something we are suggesting .
however Canadians do have a right to know whether their government did act properly in response to the allegations that are before the Commons .
the government is in a different position than members of the opposition , a distinctly different position in the fact that it has direct control over where government funding is directed .
this is what is at the very root of this question .
was government information used for the purposes of a political party ' s fundraising activities ?
these are the answers we are probing for .
unfortunately , due to the response and the patent answers that we are receiving from the government , the issue has now expanded and goes far beyond the boundaries of the province of Quebec and I would suggest far beyond the boundaries of only the Liberal Party of Canada .
as has been suggested by members of all parties , none of us are squeaky clean in this .
there is unfortunately a history in the House of parties of all political stripes being tainted by allegations .
this again ties into the issue of having more openness , more accountability and more responsibility when it comes to the issue of political fundraising .
again with respect to the specific issue that has been on everyone ' s mind of late , we are looking for information about ministers of the crown who accompany fundraisers .
Mr. Corbeil is the one name that seems to have garnered a lot of attention .
however we have information to suggest that there may be others .
these are the questions we are asking .
because of the shrouded responses we are receiving , the issue has gone far afield .
this no doubt is what is at the root of the RCMP investigation .
we have heard some references made to the fact that the investigation is nearing its end .
one can only hope that this is the case and that there will be no delay or interference .
the RCMP and the commissioner were advised of this a long time ago .
six months ago they were made aware of that .
the question we asked last week was whether the Clerk of the Privy Council was also advised of this to ensure the integrity of the government and to ensure the integrity of cabinet discussions .
that is not undue interference .
that is called government accountability .
to paraphrase the prime minister ' s recent comments in the House , it is high time that this government put up or shut up on this issue .
this is the same government that has promised transparency and integrity in bringing its matters before the House .
they promised tougher regulations of lobbyists .
each and every one of these promises has not been fulfilled and to this date I would suggest they have been broken .
the Liberals also promised to close loopholes in campaign finance laws .
that has not happened .
the activities and the government ' s response prove that these loopholes still exist and that these loopholes are large enough to drive large kickbacks through .
as much as we would like to dwell on the history of political fundraising abuses , I am more interested in getting to the root of the problem and trying to fix the problems associated with the current system .
the reality is that fundraising is the mother ' s milk of political activity .
the time has long since passed to open a meaningful and real dialogue that will bring integrity , transparency and accountability , not just these bold words but the reality of these words to this House .
this House and every member of it have been tainted with this particular scandal .
it is high time that we got to the bottom of it .
my friend in the Reform Party referenced the fact that the NDP members themselves have been tainted by bingo - gate and raising money that was supposed to be going to charitable organizations .
the leader of the Reform Party himself was alleged to have dipped into secret trust funds and expense accounts for trips , clothes and a private pension plan .
the leader of the Bloc , who is now the current Bloc House leader , saw nothing wrong with granting taxpayer funded severance packages to former staffers who then quit to go to another political venue in the province of Quebec .
the Conservative Party has baggage as well .
i am not going to dwell on that because everybody else has certainly beat that one to death .
what I would suggest is what we have done in our party .
we have consulted extensively with our membership .
we have had workshops and conferences in all the provinces and the territories .
we have been united in the need and the cause for accountability and transparency collectively in the use of management funds .
we have consulted with our members and we have acted on recommendations and have enshrined a better degree of accountability and communication measures between our PC Canada fund and the local constituency associations .
we have broadened and opened public dialogue and we have done this for the sole purpose for what this House itself is now trying to do .
we are not going through simple machinations .
we are trying to get this matter brought forward for debate .
politics is a public rather than a private process .
the standards applied for public fundraising must be given proper scrutiny .
as parliamentarians let us restore the lost public confidence in our political parties and the democratic process .
Mr. John Harvard ( Charleswood - Assiniboine , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , first I want to say thank you to the new member who just spoke .
he reminds me of his father .
i was here when his father was here .
in fact his father was here a good many years before I arrived in 1988 .
his father left his mark on this institution .
he made an enormous contribution and I am sure that his son will do exactly the same thing .
i want to comment on a couple of things that he did say .
in the period of the existence of Canada and going back to 1861 , I suppose every political party has been tarnished and sullied by a financial scandal of one kind or another .
it certainly does not bring honour to this institution and certainly does not bring honour to politicians .
one of the things that concerns me about the debate that is taking place today is that I smell a bit of a witch hunt .
i was in opposition once too and this kind of an issue lends itself to all kinds of serious questions as to where we are going and is the world coming to an end .
most of the questions are very responsible .
one of the things that we should keep in mind is that the RCMP as far as I know have not yet completed the investigation .
as far as I know they were told back in the month of March and yes , that is a few months ago .
i am not a policeman so I do not know how long it takes police agencies to investigate this kind of an issue .
however before we go off the deep end and make all kinds of assumptions , particularly that the government has wronged and wronged , why do we not just wait for the investigation ?
i can assure the hon. member who just spoke that if the RCMP find in their wisdom , and if it is confirmed by a court later that there was influence peddling , I will be as concerned as he is , and I should be .
but why do we not wait until the RCMP investigation is finished ?
it seems to me that in itself will answer some of the questions .
it may raise some other ones later on and we may have to shore up the system that we have .
i do not agree with the member from British Columbia who spoke a few minutes ago .
i do not think the system is perfect , but I do not think it is as rotten as perhaps some other speakers have suggested .
all I suggest is we just hold on to our hats and wait for some of these answers .
i know there can be a lot of impatience but let us wait for the answers .
i am absolutely convinced , because I think I know the prime minister very well , that if this investigation leads to some serious allegations by the police and if someone is found guilty there will be things done to correct the system .
no political party can tolerate this and certainly the voters in Canada cannot expect to tolerate this for a minute , if this kind of thing did indeed happen .
Mr. Peter MacKay :
Mr. Speaker , I must thank and acknowledge the remarks of the member opposite in reference to my father .
i do not take issue with the fact that the integrity of this House is something we should all value and something we have to put a great deal of emphasis on .
this is very ironic given the fact that we now have allegations involving the party opposite .
there seems to be a bit of a contradiction there in terms of how the approach is taken when it is an opposition party as opposed to a government party .
there is no question we all want to get to the bottom of this , that due process has to kick in and that we need time for the RCMP to complete its investigation .
we understand that is coming soon .
let us not have any further delay .
let us be open and honest about this .
let us find out what is really rotten in the state of Denmark .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to take part in today ' s debate on the financing of political parties .
but first , since this is my maiden speech in this new Parliament , I want to take 30 seconds to thank the constituents of T 茅 miscamingue for renewing their trust in me and tell them I will do my best to represent them adequately during this Parliament .
Claridge and Paxport were two companies that were mentioned .
the people involved , who enjoyed close ties with the old traditional parties , the Liberals and the Conservatives - or the Conservatives and the Liberals , if you prefer - allegedly filled their pockets with compensation money paid directly by cabinet .
the whole process was kept as obscure as possible so they could reward their political friends .
today , at the beginning of this new Parliament , an important issue is resurfacing : the Liberal Party is accused of influence peddling and of using lists that may have been obtained from influential ministers in this government .
these allegations of influence peddling are extremely important .
some factors must be considered .
we must look at the causes .
if you examine the way federal political parties are financed , you will immediately understand what caused the present situation .
there is no limit to how much money companies can give .
those people are not philanthropists .
they do not give to appease their social conscience .
contributions are made mainly to the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party , especially when they are in power .
is this a coincidence ?
contributions get bigger when those people are in power .
it is easy to see that there is a direct link .
several times in the last Parliament , we in this party suggested amending legislation on the financing of political parties in order to adapt it to a more modern context .
he told me that this requirement was impossible to fulfil .
now , those people say they enjoy grassroots support .
it is not easy to raise money at $ 5 , $ 10 , or $ 20 a head but this reminds us of a hard reality .
when you knock on a door to ask for a donation of $ 10 or $ 20 , the people who answer are tempted to say what they truly think about politicians , politics and the government ' s actions .
this forces us to stay in touch with the people .
but as we can see , membership is something these people find embarrassing .
money is no problem .
fifty thousand dollars , especially in the Toronto area , is not very difficult to collect .
we must reflect seriously on this situation .
i want to come back on what is happening .
the allegations in question are very serious and appear increasingly well founded as we learn more about the involvement of a Liberal Party activist who was able to approach companies with confidential information .
but when I am consulted , my office does not consider this information to be public .
i checked with officials from the Department of Human Resources Development in my riding and they do not consider this information to be public either .
the same applies to the Soci 茅 t 茅 qu 茅 b 茅 coise du d 茅 veloppement de la main - d ' oeuvre , which is also involved ; it does not consider that to be public information .
how is it that the Minister responsible for the Treasury Board estimates that this information can be made public , that it is normal for it to be released ?
is the same thing in all other departments ?
in Quebec it is known that the federal Office of Quebec Regional Development is very often an extension of the Liberal party in certain regions .
do these people also provide privileged information on the applications under study , the loans from various government bodies to businesses in the region in order to ensure that the Liberal party bag man passes by right afterward ?
i would like to take advantage of this opportunity to describe the situation .
one of the four businesses mixed up in the present situation and under investigation by the RCMP is the Raglan mining company located in my riding .
it met with the gentleman in question , Pierre Corbeil of the Liberal party .
i will review the approval process on the amount obtained from the transitional job fund .
we know that this company was awarded $ 1.3 million for an extremely important mining development in northern Quebec , one that is extremely beneficial to the people of Abitibi - T 茅 miscamingue in general and one that will have major economic impact .
today , that company finds itself tainted by association , because of a Liberal party fundraiser , and because of information leaked to him by someone with access to it , which has complicated things enormously .
what happened ?
the matter was approved by the local human resources development administration on January 22 , 1997 .
six days later , on January 28 , it was given approval by the regional Soci 茅 t 茅 qu 茅 b 茅 coise du d 茅 veloppement de la main - d ' oeuvre .
it was then passed on to Montreal , because the Canadian department of human resources development projects have to be approved in Montreal by Quebec division .
on January 30 , therefore , it was also sent to the Soci 茅 t 茅 qu 茅 b 茅 coise du d 茅 veloppement de la main - d ' oeuvre ' s head office .
on February 17 , a letter of approval from the MP was added to the file , in occurrence the letter I wrote to back the project , and it would appear that a very important meeting took place on February 25 .
on March 7 , the Minister of Human Resources Development approved the project , and on March 21 the SQDM or Quebec manpower development board issued a similar positive recommendation .
one may wonder why the minister , who claims to be waiting for the SQDM ' s opinion before going ahead , gave his approval prior to receiving it .
this is somewhat puzzling , but it might be justified under certain circumstances .
however , on February 25 , a date I want to come back to , what happened ?
Pierre Corbeil , from the Liberal Party , went knocking on the door of the Soci 茅 t 茅 mini 猫 re Raglan and met with one of its executives , asking him for a contribution , a cash contribution , which does not appear anywhere and cannot be traced , to get the project through the maze of the government ' s backrooms .
blackmailing a firm into contributing money to a political party in exchange for a grant is unacceptable .
such practices should never be condoned in our society .
i hope my colleague from Abitibi , who is from the same area as I am , agrees with me and is going to condemn this practice by a Liberal Party organizer named Pierre Corbeil .
many questions remain unanswered , and because my time is running out , I would like to mention them before concluding .
did people from the Liberal Party of Canada in our area directly or indirectly take part in these practices , were they in contact with Mr. Corbeil , did they also share this information ?
perhaps Mr. Corbeil did not come to our area simply to make this one and only intervention .
some questions are still unanswered .
who provided the list ?
who provided the information to Mr. Corbeil in the particular case of the Raglan mining company ?
who provided him with this information ?
there are still unanswered questions about these lists .
i hope the RCMP will be able to do its work freely and to arrive at some conclusions that will be extremely important and that will certainly implicate people who are very close to the government .
in closing , I want to say it is unacceptable for a so - called democratic society to tolerate such blackmail , to tolerate the existence of a patronage system - I repeat , a patronage system - within the government and the defaming of proud people who help build our regions and do not deserve to find themselves in the middle of such a controversy .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to praise my distinguished colleague , the young member for T 茅 miscamingue , for his skill as a speaker .
he said :
it is the same , except the cheques have changed colour .
you can see how candid the member for Abitibi is ; he says the method is the same .
they no longer accept certified cheques .
they ask for cash and they say : " Just shut up , or you won ' t get your grant '' .
unfortunately , that is what we have come to .
you will remember G 茅 rald Martineau from the Union nationale .
it was standard practice .
at that time , the Liberals strongly condemned that practice .
but now , we have a similar system .
i ask the member for T 茅 miscamingue to tell us if , in his region , only one mine or only one industry was approached .
he was very clear .
however , I am convinced that the member for T 茅 miscamingue could shed some light on the issue or could ask a more precise question .
Mr. Pierre Brien :
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate my hon. colleague ' s question .
it will give me an opportunity to be more specific .
Mr. Corbeil , who was referred to earlier , is an organizer for the Liberal Party of Canada .
he arrived in our region shortly before a Liberal convention .
were those seeking the nomination at the time informed of the situation by Mr. Corbeil ?
that is one question .
were the individuals looking to run under the Liberal Party banner in our region involved in this fundraising scheme ?
there is also the question of whether this was an isolated case .
one company was kind enough to notify the minister and complain about a practice it found unacceptable .
i applaud that company ' s courage in deciding to make such a move under the circumstances , because we must not forget that its application had not been approved yet .
it took a chance by complaining to the minister about the harassment it had been subjected to and about what was a rather questionable practice .
i am talking about asking for cash donations , which cannot be traced .
they asked for cash because they did not want any connection to be made between the favours granted and the contributions collected by the Liberal Party .
nobody is fooled by what is going on .
i will conclude by saying there are questions being raised that need to be answered .
i hope that this situation can be cleared up in the local Liberal associations , where individual candidates may have been involved as part of the nomination process .
i hope they were not involved , but it is up to them to provide answers .
an hon. member :
he ' s gone all quiet on us .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
Mr. Speaker , is it a practice in the opposition to remark on the presence of another member in this House ?
we all know that under the Standing Orders we are not to make such comments , but I am pleased he mentioned that I am here .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I find it astonishing that a former member of the House is not familiar with the Standing Orders .
i find this strange , since the hon. member has been a member of this House for nine years .
that having been said , I will proceed directly to the motion by the Leader of the Bloc Quebecois .
i will use my brief 10 - minute speech to describe the vision that haunts me when I put the terms " transparency " and " Liberal Party of Canada " together .
it is certainly not the most appealing image and that is why I want listeners to know right off the bat that I intend to be very critical but realistic in my remarks .
this is the sad price people must pay when hoping to gain more insight into the government they are dealing with today and , unfortunately , for a few years to come .
for over a week now , members have been trying to shed light on this dark side of the Liberal Party organization and , more specifically , the federal government .
for over a week now , members of each of the opposition parties , particularly the Bloc Quebecois , have been trying to find out about this transitional fund scandal in the last election .
unfortunately for them , the Prime Minister has decided to dodge the embarrassing issue and take refuge behind the RCMP investigation .
no matter , the Bloc Quebecois is there to ask the real questions and that is why we are presenting today an opposition motion on this extremely important matter .
indeed , who would not do a double take on hearing of certain odd doings like those engaged in by organizers of the Liberal Party of Canada , who had the lists of grant applications in their possession before they had even been approved ?
these are confidential lists .
who would not protest when we know that these same lists were used to blackmail potential contributors to the coffers of the Liberal Party of Canada ?
could that be described as democratic ?
nothing could be more ethical , we might say .
we discussed the famous Liberal code of conduct on several occasions in this House .
originally , the code was supposed to restore the government ' s integrity and image .
this instrument has definitely , and unfortunately , not been overused .
the Liberals were so concerned about projecting a positive image that they forgot that a code of ethics is not a makeup kit .
its primary purpose is to deal with conduct related issues that can hinder the proper operation of our democratic institutions .
obviously , the Liberals do not use their code often , assuming they even know it .
the scandal surrounding transitional funds shows without any doubt that the Liberals tricked us when they drafted this phoney code .
how can the government claim to be acting in compliance with a code of ethics when it stubbornly keeps on its payroll people who are said to have deliberately tried to corrupt entrepreneurs for the sole purpose of bringing money into the party ' s coffers ?
why was Pierre Corbeil not immediately suspended ?
why is Jacques Roy , an assistant to the President of the Treasury Board , still working for the government in spite of the fact that his actions are currently under investigation ?
Mr. Roy is still working for the minister .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
he is the scapegoat .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
and what about the Prime Minister ' s statements to the effect that the code of conduct does not apply to the Liberal Party of Canada , but only to the government ?
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
outrageous !
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
once again , I get the impression they are laughing at us , that some members opposite are trying to fool the public .
that shows that ethics is a consideration for Liberals only when it suits them .
what became of the nice principles they were so proud of in the red book ?
if I had time , I would go through the list of the irregularities the Liberals have done during the 35 th Parliament .
what we have seen this week is but the tip of the iceberg .
how can you explain that the Prime Minister did not issue a directive on an ethical conduct to his ministers after the Minister of Human Resources Development informed him of the RCMP investigation ?
how could anybody believe that the Liberal government made such an omission because it cares so much about the ethics guidelines .
what are we to make of the fact that the Solicitor General of Canada , who is in charge of the mounted police , like the Prime Minister calls them - somebody ought to tell him that it is now called the RCMP - was the only cabinet minister who did not know the Liberal Party of Canada was being investigated ?
how can we explain the long delay between March 1997 , when the scandal was discovered , and the search in the premises of the Liberal Party of Canada on June 12 , 1997 , just a few days after the government was re - elected ?
something smells funny in all this !
perhaps there would have been a different public reaction on June 2 , and perhaps the government would not be where it is today .
are we to believe , and this is an extremely important question the public is asking today , that no government minister was aware that a certain Mr. Corbeil , a Liberal party staffer , was collecting funds at $ 25,000 a shot ?
do you think that no one in that government was aware of it ?
come on !
but that would have been the lesser evil , considering that our entire democratic system would have benefited in future from funding from party members and supporters .
passing such legislation would have made it easier for the famous ethics I speak of so often to find a place in our federal political mores . >
but I can already hear those opposite saying that the member for Berthier - Montcalm is totally unaware that they have an ethics commissioner even .
let us talk about this ethics commissioner .
i was involved when the position was created , but the government opposite completely disregarded the remarks and requests of the Bloc Quebecois , the official opposition at the time .
the commissioner is not independent , since he is appointed by the Prime Minister , advises the Prime Minister on the sly , on a confidential basis , and has no say in decisions .
i therefore have little to say for the ethics commissioner , because , between you and me , he is not very good at his job and is certainly the government ' s accomplice in keeping silent on a number of matters .
the initial weeks of the new Parliament have revealed the true face of this patronage government with its taste for light ethics .
everything is permitted - from dubious practices to partisan appointments .
this appointment of Michel Bastarache is the worst of the government ' s political appointments .
he was appointed a justice of the supreme court .
who is Michel Bastarache ?
he was part of a firm that gave thousands of dollars to the Liberal Party of Canada in its funding drive .
Michel Bastarache ' s appointment is one of the worst the government opposite has made .
the worst of it all is that I heard the Prime Minister himself say he did not know Michel Bastarache .
i would remind him that the signature on the preface to the book written by Mr. Bastarache in 1986 was that of Jean Chr 茅 tien .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I would like to ask my distinguished colleague , the hon. member for Berthier - Montcalm , to go back in time and tell us about the nine years that preceded the arrival in office of the Liberal Party .
surely , the hon. member for Abitibi must have known former member Richard Gris 茅 , who was president of the Conservative caucus in Quebec and who , like several other Conservative ministers and members at the time , must have been implicated in scandals as shameful as the one which the Liberal Party has been covering up for two weeks already .
earlier , the hon. member for Richmond - Arthabaska , who , as the former mayor of Asbestos , presided over the destiny of his RCM ' s economic development corporation , dared mention in this House the dubious actions of the Liberal Party .
the worst in all this is - and I ask the hon. member for Berthier - Montcalm to comment on this - that it is not surprising to see fundraiser Pierre Gobeil demand cash contributions .
was part of the $ 50,000 or $ 25,000 he collected in Drummondville or in the Abitibi - T 茅 miscamingue region going to the party , with the rest going somewhere else ?
sometimes , there are potholes along the way and it is necessary to patch up here and there .
i find it very strange that a fundraiser for the Liberal Party of Canada would demand cash contributions .
worse still , that person even went so far as to give advice to the human resources director on how to cover up the misappropriation of funds , because this is what it is .
it is criminal .
it is a serious offence .
this morning , I was listening to the former assistant director general , who is the new member for Bourassa .
the member rose and pretended to be offended by our comments , but I wonder if , in fact , the Liberal Party does not agree .
all the opposition parties could settle the issue within a week by proposing legislation whereby only voters could contribute to a political party ' s fund .
the government could give , for example , one dollar for each vote received by a party during the previous election , to make up for the loss of revenues from major companies .
when Laurent Beaudoin , the president of Bombardier , gives $ 100,000 to the Liberal Party - as shown in the ledgers - it is not to get $ 100,000 out of it but hundreds of millions of dollars .
so , I would appreciate it if the hon. member for Berthier - Montcalm could elaborate on these issues .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
madam Speaker , I will attempt to answer this question .
however , I fear it might take the rest of the afternoon .
i need not give a report on nine years of Tory government since the people spoke , very clearly , I believe , in 1993 .
with the exception of two MPs , they were all turfed out of the House of Commons .
the message could not have been more clear , I think .
however , with regard to the present Liberal Party , I remember how in 1993 it ran on a platform almost exclusively dedicated to government ethics , claiming it was going to change the way things were done , and so on and so forth .
this is what is so revolting .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , what is nice about my being here today is that I seem to keep certain members of the Bloc Quebecois awake .
that is nice .
here is my answer .
the opposition motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois asks the House to condemn the attitude of the government , which refuses to introduce in - depth reform of the legislation on the financing of federal political parties even though the existing legislation allows for a wide range of abuses .
they want to talk about party financing ?
let us do just that .
i am not convinced that limiting donations solely to individuals will actually prevent corporations from making donations by giving bonuses or instructions to their employees .
company money may get to a political party through its employees .
if the party financing system is so effective in Quebec , why did the Bloc Quebecois change the amount that can be donated to make it higher ?
that is twice as much .
if according to Bloc Quebecois policy only individuals are allowed to contribute to the financing of political parties , how can the Bloc Quebecois justify that , in 1994 , candidates for the Bloc Quebecois accepted corporate donations amounting to several thousand dollars in spite of the fact that their internal regulations preclude it ?
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic ) , BQ :
madam Speaker , with nine years of seniority and after a four year absence to recycle himself , the hon. member for Abitibi has changed sides .
he is making certain allegations and I want to know the names , the amounts and the companies who made contributions .
if he cannot answer these three questions , then he should pipe down and go for another makeover .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
madam Speaker , I knew I was keeping him up .
he was asleep a while ago .
as regards these contributions of several thousands of dollars , I cannot give members ' names because we are not permitted to do so .
in Charlesbourg , they received $ 1,070 ; in Drummond , $ 1,500 ; in Manicouagan , $ 485 ; in Laval - Ouest , $ 2,500 ; and so forth .
i have the whole list .
it is public information , my friends .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
go on .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
the total .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
it must be several thousands , but if I answer their questions , I will not be able to go on with my speech .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
seven thousand dollars .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
he says $ 7,000 .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
that is right .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
no it is not , it is $ 7,939 .
it seems he cannot count .
there are $ 939 missing from the Bloc Quebecois figures .
that is not peanuts .
it is a few trips to the grocery store for people in my riding .
they think I was born yesterday .
what is the use of having pearly whites if your nose is dirty ?
think about it , my friend .
need we remind members that the Bloc Quebecois received a cash advance of $ 1.5 million from the Mouvement des caisses populaires Desjardins to launch its 1993 election campaign ?
the member for T 茅 miscamingue talked about big banks and contributions , but he forgot to mention the caisses populaires in Quebec , $ 1,5 million from small investors for the Bloc Quebecois ' s election campaign in Quebec .
that is what corporations contributed , that is what the caisses populaires contributed .
they have two different discourses .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau ( Repentigny , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , just like some members were saying , you would have to tie him up to get him to tell the truth .
i would like to remind the hon. member that there is a difference between a contribution and a loan .
i would appreciate it if the hon. members were honest in what he says in the House .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
we should not forget that the Quebec electoral legislation does not prevent financing activities where some people often pay in excess of a $ 1,000 to sit close to a minister or an MNA they wish to talk to .
this is how Daniel Paill 茅 , a former PQ minister , became rich .
that way of doing things was also used in $ 2,000 - a - plate dinners attended by the likes of Jacques Parizeau , Bernard Landry , Jean Campeau .
the Bloc may very well idolize the Quebec legislation , it remains that it does not prevent minor and serious violations , like the ones committed by Marie Malavoy , a former PQ MNA who contributed to party coffers although she was prohibited from doing so by the legislation because she had not yet become a Canadian citizen .
some hon. members :
give us some .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
No.
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
i was hoping you would ask .
all together , now .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
take , for example , the famous and pathetic episode about the Le Hir reports and the improprieties in the contract awarding process .
Parizeau finally admitted , in December 1995 , that he had known since June 1995 about these things , about the backroom schemes for the awarding of contracts .
Yvon Cyrenne , one of the Le Hir report authors , gave $ 900 to the PQ in 1994 . Yvon Martineau , who became CEO of Hydro - Qu 茅 bec , contributed $ 1,000 to the PQ fund the year before his appointment .
people really want us to discuss the issue of political party contributions .
we can do it .
they want us to speak about Abitibi .
if the Bloc members in this House go to the library , they will see my campaign expenses in the report of the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada .
i was a candidate in Abitibi .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
in what year ?
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
in 1988 .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
for which party ?
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
in 1988 .
madam Speaker , they say I switched parties .
i know Lucien Bouchard .
he switched parties six times .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
brown - nosed chameleon .
the Leader of the Bloc Quebecois in Ottawa changed party three times .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
brown - nosed chameleon .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
it happened twice in my case .
i am happy to have moved from one political party to another .
but let us come back to books and history .
what did Guy Saint - Julien receive during the 1988 election ?
oddly enough , we don ' t hear them talk about their electoral contributions in the last election .
we don ' t hear them talk about their expenses and the contributions they received .
i received $ 23,870 from 109 donors , and they were only individual contributions .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau :
and companies ?
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
none .
no company at all .
but something bothers me a little .
it ' s too bad he is now in Quebec because I could have asked him to tell me the meaning of " other organizations '' .
what does that mean ?
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
aren ' t you a jealous guy .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
forty - one thousand dollars for one campaiagn , under " other organizations '' .
they don ' t even have the decency to indicate where it came from .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
you were in the government at that time .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
madam Speaker , it is true that Quebec was the first province in Canada to limit the election expenses of parties and candidates and to reimburse candidates for part of their expenses .
they then turned around and said , " One of the innovations in the financing of political parties in Quebec concerns the contributions that can only be made by voters '' .
it is true that the Canadian Parliament changed the Canada Elections Act provisions on election expenses .
this was in accordance with the increases in election expenses of all political parties and of the Chief Electoral Officer in his statutory reports for 1979 , 1980 and 1983 .
essentially , maximum election expenses were raised by 30 % . These expenses can no longer be incurred by third parties . Candidates will have their expenses reimbursed .
under a new scheme , political parties will have part of their election expenses reimbursed also .
members opposite have been talking about the hon. member for Abitibi several times and the financing of his campaign .
people in Quebec and Abitibi will not be fooled .
but maybe -
some hon. members :
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
they can keep talking all they want , but I may be the first member of this House to talk about the campaign preceding the June 2 election .
that is not so long ago .
i have here the list of contributions to my campaign .
no Bloc member could hand me his own list right away .
i will give them 60 seconds .
Mr. Ren 茅 Canuel :
i have mine right here .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
the Raglan mining company is located in the northern part of my riding .
Mr. Ren 茅 Laurin :
they make cash contributions .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
the hon. member for Rouyn - Noranda is right when he speaks about the Raglan mining company .
he is dead right .
i know Michel Rioux of that company quite well .
he is a man of integrity .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
madam Speaker , would you please remind the hon. member for Abitibi that everything that is being said here is recorded in Hansard .
he should be more respectful of the truth .
he should know that the Liberal Party collects cash contributions .
when it is cash , it goes right into the party coffers , and just about any name can be used .
that is probably the reason why there are no mines on his list .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
madam Speaker , it is strange , but -
some hon. members :
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
resuming debate with the hon. member for Abitibi .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
madam Speaker , my constituents in Abitibi know that I stand up for what I believe in .
i am an honest person .
i get books out of the library .
i dig up figures .
i even go get -
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
you know , everything is public information nowadays .
my expenses for the June 2 election have already been tabled .
they have been tabled and if anyone wants to see them , they have only to pay for copies from the returning officer in my riding .
Abitibi covers 802,000 square kilometres , and has a population of over 92,000 .
it stretches from Val d ' Or , the mining sector , to the Raglan sector in the east .
the Raglan mine is 2,000 miles away .
that is the same distance as from Abitibi to Tampa , Florida .
but I want to get back to Raglan .
the member for Rouyn - Noranda is right .
as I was saying earlier , the head of Raglan , of Falconbridge in New Quebec , is Gerry Bilodeau .
i visited that mine in August .
i know Michel Rioux very well .
it is regrettable that such things are being said in Quebec .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
we are honest folks .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
he can say what he wants , but at least I visit my riding .
let us go back to the 1996 by - election in Lac - Saint - Jean .
the Bloc Quebecois said : " We want to do the right thing .
we are for individual contributions .
individuals must contribute '' .
their principle is $ 5,000 and under .
i find it strange that , in the 1996 election , there are no contributions from individuals , none .
it is just a $ 51,000 contribution .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
be honest , now .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
we are .
the figures are all available from the library .
ask the Chair .
he is asking me to be honest .
i got this from the library this morning .
that is what is important .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau :
on a point of order , Madam Speaker .
the hon. member for Abitibi is waving a piece of paper and he claims to be honest .
i would ask the unanimous consent of the House for the hon. member to table this sheet of paper .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
is there unanimous consent ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
some hon. members :
No.
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
we do not have unanimous consent .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
on the same point of order , Madam Speaker .
i will table this copy only after I am done with my speech .
i will not take orders from this House before I am done with my speech .
i need to refer to my notes . This
is a directive from the Bloc Quebecois .
i did not have the time to finish my speech .
i need to refer to those notes .
they hurt because I am really shaking them up today .
i will not need to make another trip to the library .
i want to save myself some running round .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
we normally let members deliver their speech without being interrupted .
the member for Abitibi , on debate .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
madam Speaker , I knew you would be impartial .
it is important to conclude one ' s speech .
he wanted me to stop speaking .
truth is funny , sometimes .
the member did not want me to go on with my notes .
again , in 1996 , the numbers for 1996 are in this library book .
i will tell you what book it is .
i have it here and I can even table it .
it gives the official results .
i want to finish with this document .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau :
madam Speaker , I do not know what citation of Beauchesne ' s says so , but there is one that says it is forbidden to use props like that during a speech .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
madam Speaker , since I have no right to pick up props and show them , I will look at them .
props have been mentioned .
the truth comes from the library , but I have no right to show it .
as for the 1997 campaign , everything is public and I could come back on several matters .
let us get serious .
we are having a bit of fun here .
we are in the House of Commons , but it is as if we were at a hockey game .
it is true that some aspects of financing need to be improved .
Quebec has good legislation on financing .
many things can be pointed out , but I will never be opposed to improving the financing of political parties and the government will never say clearly that it does not want to improve it .
it will always find new ways .
i am honoured to have been able to keep the members of the Bloc Qu 茅 b 茅 cois opposite , who are defending their ridings , awake .
i want to tell you one thing : the people of Abitibi are proud of the fact that I am here and I have nothing to hide .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I am not too proud of hearing someone from my region make such a speech and talk so much nonsense in so little time .
and I doubt the constituents from Abitibi are proud to see their representative make such a scene in the House .
first , thank God he is not the Minister of Finance .
anyone who cannot differentiate between a loan and a donation has a serious problem .
a financial institution lending money to a political party for a campaign and being paid back later certainly is not comparable to a bank making a $ 500,000 donation to a political party .
saying that there is no difference is either very dishonest or very ignorant .
i will let you decide which .
it is one or the other , but not both , I hope .
second , the hon. member spoke about the contributions made in Abitibi in 1993 .
he declared that he never received contributions from businesses .
the 1993 election report that was published states that the riding of Abitibi received 29 donations , for a total of $ 9,400 .
the member says he has a large riding to visit .
let us talk about his visits to his riding .
that was the highest total claimed in a year .
in 1993 , for half a year , from April 1 to one month after election day , he claimed $ 72,749 in travelling expenses .
in six months .
that is a 300 % increase over the same period in the previous year .
one cannot talk through one ' s hat here .
some day , the member will have to answer for his actions and I can assure you that his constituents will know the truth and I will condemn this double talk .
here is my question :
some reference was made earlier to the Raglan Mining Company and we will clarify that , because this is one of the companies that is involved because of the Liberal Party and that has unfortunately been dragged into a messy situation .
first of all , does the hon. member for Abitibi denounce this Pierre Corbeil ' s schemes ?
does he know him or has he ever met him ?
another interesting question :
has he been aware of these schemes between the Liberal Party he represents and the people at the Raglan Mining Company , which is a subsidiary of Falconbridge ?
he must answer those questions , and I ask him to correct all the nonsense he has been saying .
i pointed out a number of things a moment ago : the basic difference between a donation and a loan , but also the fact that he said he did not get any contribution from companies whereas the list shows the contrary .
the least the member should do is tell the House the truth .
i am not accusing him of doing the opposite .
i am giving him a second chance to correct things .
but he must tell the House the truth .
i conclude by saying that I do not feel any pride when I see the representative of the area I too represent making such a clown of himself in the House of Commons .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
madam Speaker , as I understood - and I apologize if I am mistaken - the caisses populaires made a contribution or something like that .
on April 19 , 1995 -
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the member for Repentigny has the floor .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau :
he is waking up after nine years .
he probably was in hibernation all that time .
i would remind the member , who is drawing a pension on top of his salary , that he cannot use props .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
in his point of order , the member mentioned that I am presently drawing a pension as a member of Parliament .
is the member allowed to mention that ?
if so , I would like him to mention the amount of that pension because , as a matter of fact , I stopped receiving a pension on the evening of June 2 .
some of your colleagues to your right and in front of you are now receiving two salaries from Quebec , at $ 36,000 and $ 32,000 .
it is important to give the correct figure .
July and August is the only time of year one can take time away from this House to visit the riding of Abitibi , a riding that covers 553,000 square kilometres and that includes New Quebec .
it is also the safest time to travel in these parts .
this member of the Bloc does know New Quebec .
i invite him to come and visit that area to understand what New Quebec is all about .
speaking of expenses , I sent a letter to the hon. member for T 茅 miscamingue and I also sent La Fronti 猫 re , a newspaper , an open letter listing all of my expenses , even those incurred by my wife , including $ 5,851.18 for moving our furniture from our private home in Ottawa to Abitibi .
do you know what precipitated those specific expenses ?
there is one thing I want to mention in answer to the question put by the hon. member for T 茅 miscamingue .
he wants the province of Quebec to separate from Canada but , when he talks about my expenses , he forgets that my family , my wife and my daughter , came to Ottawa , otherwise our family would have been separated .
we will never agree to Quebec separating from the rest of Canada and I will never agree to be separated from my family .
we have a budget to travel to our ridings and to maintain our relationships with our wives and children .
try to take away that money in Ottawa , Mr. the hon. member for T 茅 miscamingue , and I promise you , you ' re going to get it .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , since debate has drifted slightly off on to the extraordinary expense account of my colleague from Abitibi , I find it ironic to hear that his riding is large .
was not New Quebec in his riding a year before , in 1992 ?
how is it that he had go there in 1993 only ?
first , the fact that , in 1993 , he received contributions from corporations and , second , did he come in direct or indirect contact with Pierre Corbeil , who is accused of influence peddling , of having solicited corporations for cash and of fraudulent practices ?
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
madam Speaker , I will be brief .
an hon. member :
No.
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
if we are talking about 1993 , I received donations from individuals , it is true , and I received from 29 businesses and business organizations -
some hon. members :
Aha .
some hon. members :
Aha .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
if they let me speak , I could complete what I had to say on spending .
i want to tell you that in the previous years , I was travelling with the Quebec government , the Liberal government in Quebec , aboard its F - 27 .
in 1993 , I got more invitations to travel to New Quebec and -
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member .
the hon. member for Charlesbourg , on debate .
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I would like to begin by thanking the hon. member for Abitibi because he told things that I did not know , for example , that we can borrow a donation .
he taught me something and I thank him for that .
but I would like him to explain how that can be done , because that would help me understand a little better the economic policy of the Liberal Party of Canada .
in English , the only true language of the Liberal party of Canada , `` it ' s the pot calling the kettle black '' .
the question we are debating today is one of fundamental importance .
it is too important to be a partisan one , for it goes to the very core of our democratic life .
since political parties are necessary to our democracy , those political parties must be healthy , alive and involved in the health of our democracy .
the business of the financing of political parties is dear to the heart of the Parti Quebecois , to those of us who are the sole true representatives of democracy here , because we are the only ones who accept funding only from individuals .
this is a matter to which I personally attach a great deal of importance -
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member .
the hon. member for Abitibi on a point of order .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
madam Speaker , may I have the permission of the Bloc Quebecois to hand my props to the clerk ?
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i would ask the hon. member for Charlesbourg to please speak without any props .
Mr. Richard Marceau :
madam Speaker , it is unfortunate that the Standing Orders of the House require the cameras be trained only on the person speaking , because our audience missed a real burlesque show .
permit me to share with this House some thoughts on the distressing performance by the government since the allegations of influence peddling became public .
according to the Prime Minister , this is a model government .
since 1993 , the party and the government have boasted of their honesty and integrity : no scandal , clear sailing .
they were lucky , but the good times are finally over as we can see .
i will not go over the facts , as they were related several times earlier .
i will , however , say the following .
it is all very sad for the Solicitor General .
the Prime Minister knew , the Minister of Public Works and Government Services knew , the Minister of Human Resources Development knew , the President of the Treasury Board knew , but the Solicitor General did not .
section 5 ( 1 ) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act provides that : " The Governor in Council may appoint an officer , to be known as the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , who , under the direction of the Minister - that is the Solicitor General - has the control and management of the Force and all matters connected therewith '' .
it is unbelievable that the minister responsible for the RCMP is practically the only member of the Liberal cabinet unaware of the events .
does the Solicitor General still have any credibility ?
either cabinet has no confidence in him - in which case it would be very difficult for the Solicitor General to do any sort of sensitive work if his cabinet colleagues did not trust him - or the Solicitor General is not on top of the issues .
i am sorry , but , if there is one position here in Canada that requires a person be aware of the issues , it is that of minister , and especially that of Solicitor General .
another possibility , and this is becoming downright dangerous , is that the Solicitor General has lost control of his responsibilities , which include the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the RCMP , which , coincidentally , has been in the headlines of late .
if the Solicitor General is not in control , democracy is in jeopardy .
the kind of scandal in which the Liberals are currently involved - and this is indeed a scandal - has not been seen in Quebec for over 20 years , ever since the Parti Quebecois first came to power .
and it is no coincidence .
Ren 茅 L 茅 vesque came of age politically under Maurice Duplessis and had grown to despise the dubious financing practices of the Union nationale , obviously , but also of the Liberal Party .
by restricting political party financing to voters only , Quebec was sending a very clear message : politics is to serve the common good , not the interests of corporations , be they large corporations or major trade unions .
in the province of Quebec , politics serves the citizens , and Quebec is a model of democracy around the world .
to my colleague , the hon. member for Bourassa , I say that we are not tearing our shirts .
we are bursting with pride , and rightly so .
what is incredible is that the situation at the federal level has not changed .
remember when the Tories were in power , which was not so long ago , all kinds of scandals broke out .
there was the Sinclair Stevens affair , the Oerlikon affair , the influence peddling affair involving MP Gris 茅 , the tainted tuna affair and the Airbus affair , which is still causing a stir today .
during the entire time when the Conservatives were in office , the Liberal Party , which was the official opposition at the time , acted outraged over all these scandals and strongly condemned the government .
but what did they do when in government ?
absolutely nothing .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
they did worse .
Mr. Richard Marceau :
my colleague , the hon. member for Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , is right , they did worse .
it is clear today that the real reason why Liberal members denounced the Conservative government ' s scandals was that they were not the ones at the receiving end .
that was their only reason for denouncing these scandals .
how can I walk through my riding and tell constituents on Grands - Ducs Street in Stoneham , Vaillancourt Street in St - 脡 mile or Mathieu Boulevard in Charlesbourg that federal politics is completely clean , as provincial politics is in Quebec ?
i simply cannot , as two of Canada ' s major political parties have proved the contrary .
the Liberal Party has made it clear that it does not want the current situation to change and is perfectly happy with the status quo .
i am reminding the other parties that the Bloc Quebecois has already made a commitment to accept only contributions coming from voters , from individuals .
can the Reform Party make the same commitment ?
can the Conservatives ?
can our colleagues from the New Democratic Party ?
i am waiting for an answer .
in closing , the revelations made just recently show that a major cleanup of federal politics is in order .
it can be done , but do we have the will ?
the Bloc Quebecois found the way to do it because it wanted to .
my question to the other parties is :
do you want to ?
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , the member opposite sounds like Tartuffe who said : " Hide thy bosom from mine eyes '' .
let us look at contributions received by the Bloc Quebecois .
if they want to talk principles , that is what we will do .
would Bloc members rather have ten contributions from members of the board than one from the corporation ?
would they rather have preferential rates and a loan from the Mouvement Desjardins ?
are they in the pay of the Mouvement Desjardins ?
i find it despicable to come up with these allegations , to continually act like Tartuffe , when we all know that the Canadian system is probably one of the best in the world .
the Bloc must stop tarnishing our institution to promote its separatist dream .
the Bloc ' s own true leader , Lucien Bouchard , ran under the Conservative banner .
in 1988 , he received $ 41,000 from organizations that were not individuals .
when I see members opposite continually cry murder , I feel sorry for them , Madam Speaker .
does he believe one can be bought with a contribution in return for some assets ?
when will the hon. member talk seriously , Madam Speaker ?
Mr. Richard Marceau :
madam Speaker , I thank the former assistant director general of the Liberal Party of Canada , who in fact held that position when the allegations -
Mr. Denis Coderre :
i rise on a point of order , Madam Speaker .
i left my position as general manager in October 1996 and the allegations are supposedly about something that took place on March 6 , 1997 .
i ask the member to withdraw his remarks .
Mr. Richard Marceau :
madam Speaker , what took place on March 5 and 6 is that the RCMP was informed about what was going on and about what had gone on earlier .
in true parliamentary spirit , I would like to begin by congratulating the member for Bourassa .
i had not had a chance to do so and his presence in the House today is a measure of his tenacity and determination .
not once , not twice , not three times , but four times he ran before winning an election .
and just as a little aside , he might like to tell us a little later why , having had to run four times to get elected , he does not want to allow Quebeckers to vote a third time on Quebec ' s sovereignty ?
that is a good question and one he should perhaps answer .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , when I was at college , I took two courses on statistics .
and we were told that , when a general survey is mailed out , for every person that answers , there are between 75 and 119 , if memory serves , who read the document , and who are interested in replying , but who are afraid to , or do not have the time or the guts to do so .
as regards the trail of wrongdoings now plaguing the government and the Liberal Party , five corporations , five businessmen informed the Minister of Human Resources Development that they had been asked for cash contributions , and asked to keep quiet about it .
if five have done so , according to the figures I recall , there may well be 800 to 1,200 industries , businessmen , who have had their arms twisted to contribute very large amounts of money .
naturally , the minister took the trouble to write to Mr. Murray of the RCMP to ask that the matter be investigated .
if five individuals brought this to the minister ' s attention , it means there are many others who coughed up large amounts .
and I suspect that certain companies in my riding coughed up money .
Mr. Richard Marceau :
Mr. Speaker , I would just like to pick up on what my colleague , the member for Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , was saying .
surely this is just the tip of the iceberg we are talking about right now , and it is important that the government one day shed light on this whole affair .
but unfortunately it seems this is not its intention .
the Speaker :
it being almost 2 p.m. , we will proceed to Statements by Members .
statements BY MEMBERS
world RURAL WOMEN ' S DAY
Ms. Aileen Carroll ( Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and support the celebrations of world rural women ' s day on October 15 .
the idea of an annual celebration of rural women originated in 1995 during the fourth United Nations conference on women held in Beijing .
it is appropriate that the day chosen to celebrate this day is one day before world food day as women in rural areas around the world make an invaluable contribution to the production of food and the management of other natural resources .
despite their crucial role , many rural women face serious limitations in access to land , credit , agricultural extension services and other key resources .
if governments are to achieve international development goals such as world food security and sustainable development we must support the contribution of women and their full participation in agricultural and rural development .
please join me in honouring the contributions to our welfare made by these one billion rural women .

SIKHS
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am proud to join Sikhs across Canada in celebrating the 100 th anniversary of the arrival of Sikh pioneers to Canada .
after experiencing hardships , racial discriminations , Sikhs and people of South Asian origin should be commended for their openness , success and contributions to Canada .
our heritage values , strong family ties , community involvement and peaceful coexistence enrich Canada and its cultural mosaic .
yet memories of hardships and prejudice experienced endure .
the government of Canada owes these people an apology .
by remembering history , government must learn the importance of equality and fair treatment of all people .

radar VETERANS REUNION
Mr. Paul Steckle ( Huron - Bruce , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is with great pleasure that I rise today to acknowledge two of my constituents from Huron - Bruce .
Mr. James Henderson and Mr. Bruce Wamsley both served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during the second world war .
they are present here today in Ottawa as part of a special World War II radar reunion .
during the second world war , Canada served the vital function of providing the combined Commonwealth forces with the bulk of their tactical assistance and expertise .
more specifically , Canadian Forces Base Clinton , a base that was located in my riding , was primarily responsible for this function .
their efforts and sacrifice during what was the world ' s darkest hour ensured the preservation of the values and traditions that all Canadians enjoy today .

c . D . HOWE INSTITUTE
Mr. Gilles - A .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the C . D . Howe Institute released an analysis which confirmed what we have been saying for a long time .
it says that Canada and a sovereign Quebec would be well advised to negotiate promptly a mutually beneficial agreement .
the arguments of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs are once again refuted by common sense .
it must be that the oft - repeated words of the Quebec premier are finally finding an echo in English Canada .
those who try to intimidate Quebec can talk all they want , reality will overtake them and common sense will prevail .

CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Pierrefonds - Dollard , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as a physician , I am pleased to mark the 130 th anniversary of the Canadian Medical Association , or CMA .
the CMA was born on October 9 , 1867 , under the leadership of Dr. William Marsden , who was soon considered to be the father of this association .
in those days , the CMA had 167 members .
today , it represents the vast majority of physicians at the federal level .
the CMA speaks on behalf of physicians and provides a full range of services through its member service centre and its various branches , including corporate affairs , research , professional affairs , marketing and commercial activities , professional development and public affairs .
long live the great family of the Canadian Medical Association , its twelve independent provincial and territorial divisions and its 42 affiliates .
* * *
CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , on October 9 , 1867 , three months after the proclamation of Canadian Confederation , 167 physicians from the then four provinces of Canada met in Quebec City to establish the Canadian Medical Association .
the first president of the CMA was Sir Charles Tupper who would later in 1896 serve as Prime Minister of Canada .
today the Canadian Medical Association celebrates its 130 th anniversary , making it one of the oldest associations in Canada .
the mission of the CMA is to provide leadership for physicians and to promote the highest standard of health and health care for Canadians .
it is an honour for me as a physician to commemorate this anniversary and I ask that you , Mr. Speaker , and my colleagues join me in extending our best wishes to the doctors of Canada .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .

radar VETERANS REUNION
Mr. Peter Goldring ( Edmonton East , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , as a former airman in the Royal Canadian Air Force of the 1960 s I am pleased to announce today we are honoured by the presence in the gallery of veterans who manned the Commonwealth radar installations in the second world war .
these men and women of the Royal Canadian Air Force operated and maintained these never sleeping , ever - vigilant eyes of freedom .
the use of radar was pioneered by our visitors , developing into a technology that protected Canada through the cold war but , more importantly , by detecting the earliest stages of enemy air attacks .
the radar network saved countless lives and helped ensure victory for the Allies .
i invite all members of the House to give recognition to Canada ' s honourable radar veterans of the Royal Canadian Air Force .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .

radar VETERANS REUNION
Mr. John Richardson ( Perth - Middlesex , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise in the House today to echo the tribute to the Canadian men and women who were called by the British government to assist the Allies ' air defence and they answered " Ready , aye , ready '' .
we have them here today as a testimonial .
this may be their last reunion as time catches up .
we love to have the opportunity to salute their efforts .
i would also like to pay special tribute to the role women played in this vital service to the RAF .
thousands of Canadians responded and offered their services to meet the Royal Air Force ' s critical shortage of personnel in the radar systems on land and sea and in the air .
these brave men and women were required to train for eight rigorous weeks and went on to serve honourably at radar stations in Europe , Asia , Africa , Arabia , India , China and other Far East countries .
many military historians attribute the victory in this war to the Allies ' superiority in radar air defence .
all this week the radar technicians have been in Ottawa for what may be their last reunion because many of their operators may be too old to keep it going .
* * *
liberal PARTY OF CANADA
Mr. Ghislain Lebel ( Chambly , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , since last week , the Liberal government has been in hot water .
allegations of influence peddling have been pouring down on the Liberal Party of Canada and on certain individuals in key positions within the government .
yet the Prime Minister and the President of the Treasury Board refuse to budge , hiding behind lame excuses .
those who spend years teaching others to keep clean cannot take any risk when it comes to cleaning up their own house .
yet the government ' s ethics counsellor works quietly , behind closed doors .
departmental employees are blithely breaking the government ' s code of ethics .
there is still no legislation to make political party financing more transparent .
the real policy of the government in this area is nothing but a sham .
considering the way the government has been acting , it can no longer afford to give anybody lessons in public ethics .
* * *
radar VETERANS REUNION
Ms. Marlene Catterall ( Ottawa West - Nepean , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I too want to pay tribute to the nearly 6,000 Canadians who volunteered to serve during the second world war as radar technicians with the Royal Air Force .
they served around the world , but they also helped to defend Britain against invasion by air , warning of air raids and bombing attacks and thus helping the people of Britain through their darkest hour .
the efforts of these radar technicians were crucial in withstanding the assault of the Third Reich , the eventual victory for the Allies and the end of World War II.
the British government sent certificates of appreciation to these Canadian heroes , but instead of being distributed at the time they were destroyed .
i am proud to have been instrumental last year in ensuring that a half century later , at their 50 th reunion , these veterans finally got the certificates they deserved .
today I am pleased to invite members of Parliament to meet and personally thank our radar technician veterans in Room 237 - C immediately after question period .

the SENATE
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , next week will mark the anniversary of the first Senate election in Canada .
on October 16 , 1989 Albertans elected the late Stan Waters to the Senate .
Albertans chose Stan Waters and the Prime Minister honoured their choice by appointing Stan to the upper chamber in 1990 .
Stan Waters made Canadian history when he was elected by the biggest majority of Canadians in any election .
he was chosen by the people to represent the people , not the interests of the political party in power .
Stan Waters set the example that the Prime Minister can follow , if he chooses to respect the principles of true democracy and honour the will of the people , because Senate election acts currently exist in both British Columbia and Alberta .
Canadians deserve more than government by patronage and appointment .
today an elected Senate is possible without constitutional change .
let us follow the -

job CREATION
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Brossard - La Prairie , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to draw the hon. members ' attention to the actions taken by the Government of Canada to revive and develop the site of the military base and the airport area in Saint - Hubert and their surroundings .
the Federal Office of Regional Development for Quebec decided to contribute $ 990,000 to a local initiative for the creation of the Saint - Hubert military base and airport area corporation .
this corporation will be responsible for managing $ 1 million in adjustment money that the defence department made available to the area .
moreover , $ 6 million will be invested over three years to transform the economic base of the area and promote technological development .
the financial assistance will be used to help implement expansion plans for the small businesses in my area , Montreal ' s south shore .
this is a fine example of how good long - term jobs can be created in Quebec .
* * *
health CARE
Ms. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have good news and bad news for Canadians today .
the good news is , two - tier health care is not a threat any more .
the bad news is , it is a reality .
allowing a private hospital to operate paves the way for two - tier health care .
the government , egged on by the Reform Party , is standing aside to let it happen .
this new private hospital is chomping at the bit to set up shop in Toronto , Edmonton and Vancouver .
surely patient care must always come before profit .
* * *
national FAMILY WEEK
Ms. Diane St - Jacques ( Shefford , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to bring National Family Week to the attention of the House .
like many other Canadians , I am pressed for time by my work schedule and my other activities .
we should all relax a little .
we must not forget our family , whether it is a traditional family , a reconstituted family , an extended family or a single parent family .
we must each remember our own family , and those governing us must do the same .
unfortunately , the average Canadian family is growing poorer every day .
i wish the government would remember whom it represents .
between National Family Week and National Child Day , November 20 , I hope it will finally set its own targets for the reduction of poverty , for the good of our children and of their families .
* * *
OKTOBERFEST
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Oktoberfest in Kitchener - Waterloo , Ontario is an annual event which this year is from October 10 to 19 .
this festival underscores the German heritage of our area in Ontario and in Canada .
the Oktoberfest parade on October 13 is a nationally televised event which enables families everywhere to enjoy the spirit of " Gemutlichkeit " which means good cheer and good will which is so much part of this celebration .
i encourage all Canadians to join Kitchener - Waterloo in this great celebration .

youth EMPLOYMENT
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , over the past several years youth in particular have been made to bear the brunt of the needlessly high level of unemployment imposed on this country by the Liberal government .
in my riding of Tobique - Mactaquac , more specifically school district 12 , progress was being made .
that is the good news .
the bad news is that the Liberal government took one look at the results of the program and did what came naturally .

NIAGARA - ON - THE - LAKE , ONT .
Mr. Gary Pillitteri ( Niagara Falls , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Niagara - on - the - Lake , a town I have the honour of representing federally , may rank as the second prettiest town in the world .
but in the hearts of those who live there and of the 3.5 million who visit our community each year , Niagara - on - the - Lake is and will always be the most beautiful town in the world .
today I would like to salute Niagara - on - the - Lake and congratulate its citizens who made it possible for this beautiful Canadian town to participate in this important international competition and place second .
while I congratulate Stratford , I would like to point out that three of the four finalists were Canadian towns .
this speaks volumes for Canada , the best country in the world in which to live .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
government GRANTS
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , when the Liberals took office back in 1993 they spent a lot of time talking about integrity .
they made a big show about appointing an ethics commissioner and they promised that the days of Mulroney style political corruption were over .
now reports of patronage ridden contracting , unethical fundraising and politically motivated grants keep piling up .
the police have even raided the Liberal Party headquarters .
my question for the Prime Minister is , besides calling in the RCMP , what is he going to do to remove the clouds of corruption that are surrounding his government ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , when the allegation was made that somebody was asking people for money , the minister did not wait one day .
he immediately on the same afternoon called the RCMP and informed them of the allegation .
this is what had to be done and it was done promptly .
the RCMP are now investigating a case involving one or two people .
when I hear the Leader of the Opposition make an extravagant statement like that , I say he should wait for the investigation to finish .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , there was no reference to words like ethics or integrity in the Prime Minister ' s reply , nor was there any reference to those words in the Speech from the Throne this year .
at the operational level those words have been replaced by words like influence peddling , string pulling and shakedown .
i have a question about the transitional jobs fund , the $ 300 million kitty that the federal government doles out with special attention to Liberal ridings .
what is the Prime Minister going to do to remove the cloud of suspicion that now hangs around the transitional jobs program ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the transitional jobs fund is allocated to areas where there are a lot of unemployed people .
the program is still there .
most of these ridings , particularly in Atlantic Canada , are not Liberal ridings any more and the program is still there .
the member for Edmonton North made a very strong accusation the other day and she did not even know the difference between Winnipeg and Montreal .
she talked about the Shawinigan shakedown but the person who was eligible to receive the grant did not -
the Speaker :
the hon. Leader of the Opposition .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , mere weeks before the election was called this spring , millions of dollars from this transitional jobs fund were funnelled into the Prime Minister ' s own riding .
they were trying to make sure that his job was not transitional .
what influence did the Prime Minister exert to make sure that those grants to his own riding were announced just prior to the federal election ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister of Canada who is the member for Saint - Maurice , will always work to make sure that the people who live in his riding are treated the same way as people in the other ridings in Canada .
i have never had a temporary job here like the Leader of the Opposition .
i have been elected 11 consecutive times and I have never lost an election federally .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
no wonder , Mr. Speaker , if he can keep buying his way into office .
we have some pretty serious questions here .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
the Speaker :
i would urge all hon. members now to be very judicious in their choice of words .
miss Deborah Grey :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to judiciously say that on March 5 the minister for HRD sent a letter and asked the police to investigate illegal fundraising .
he knows that .
but just 24 hours before that , the same minister approved $ 3 million out of that same jobs fund to go into the Prime Minister ' s riding .
let me ask the minister for HRD this .
just how is it that he signed cheques one day and called police the very next day ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the member has a hard time with chronology .
i could not know on March 4 things that I found out on March 5 , the very day I called the police in .
these people are so cynical .
they do not understand a thing about integrity in government .
i will say one thing .
all projects have been approved based on merit .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
on the Wednesday he wrote to the RCMP as if there was some amazing new revelation that he had received to blow the whistle on corruption in that fund .
the ink was not even dry on those cheques .
let me ask him this and please come up with a better defence .
did it just hit the minister that something might be wrong as the clock struck midnight ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
my deputy minister conferred with me that our process was transparent , that our process was with consultation , the strength of our system and they invited -

the hon. member for Laurier - Sainte - Marie .

RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the President of the Treasury Board would appear to be the Quebec godfather in the Government of Canada .
he provides the link between the government ' s action and the Liberal Party of Canada .
we have learned that one of his political assistants , an individual at the very heart of the government ' s activities , is currently under investigation by the RCMP , and the President of the Treasury Board is not doing anything about it .
is the Prime Minister not aware that these elements combined together oblige him to submit the case of his minister -
the Speaker :
the Prime Minister .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
the Mr. Roy in question has sent a letter to the CBC asking it to retract , because his lawyers are saying he was never under investigation by the RCMP .
before rising in the House and saying he is under investigation , it would not be a bad idea to do a little research .
as to our course of action , in all such cases I consult the ethics commissioner .
i did so in this one .
i discuss it with Mr. Wilson so he can check the facts .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , can the Prime Minister tell us whether on or about March 6 he consulted his ethics commissioner and whether the commissioner told him that he should not take any action with respect to the permanent employees of the Liberal Party of Canada or the employees of the President of the Treasury Board and that he should wait for charges to be laid in connection with allegations made regarding an employee of the Liberal Party of Canada around the middle of June , after the June 2 election , as perhaps the member for Hamilton is aware ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I can only add that the person whose integrity was attacked by the CBC and subsequently by everyone else has formally demanded that the CBC make a retraction , because he is not under investigation by the RCMP .
so , as far as I am concerned , the answer is clear .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , in 1985 , the current Prime Minister said in this House that any innuendo or any suggestion of irregularities would undermine the confidence of Canadians and that it would be better if the suspect were to hand in his resignation .
at the time , the Prime Minister was quick to criticize another government .
how can he explain today how incredibly tolerant he is in this matter which involves the President of the Treasury Board and which is under investigation ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will repeat that there is simply no RCMP investigation , as mentioned in the letter Mr. Roy ' s lawyers sent on this issue .
so , no employee from the office of the President of the Treasury Board is under investigation .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , one fact remains .
given everything we have found out these past two weeks about this influence peddling business , I want to ask the Prime Minister the following question :
what good is a government code of conduct that nobody knows anything about and that has no appropriate provision for this type of situation ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the ethics counsellor is there for everyone , for all the hon. members , for everybody , and everybody consults him .
he is a very honourable and highly respected man .
* * *
ATLANTIC CANADA
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
on his way to today ' s Atlantic Vision Conference the Minister of Industry had the arrogance and the audacity to tell Atlantic Canadians not to expect a fair hearing from this government because they made a " mistake " when they fired Liberals in the last election .
will the Prime Minister tell this House whether he has demanded a retraction from his industry minister for his colossal contempt toward Atlantic Canadians ?
if not , will he do so today ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we all argue that it is better to vote for your party than to vote for another party .
i never asked my electors in my riding to vote for the NDP .
they always lost their deposit .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Prime Minister ' s Office confirmed this government has no plan to extend , renew or replace the TAGS program .
this will condemn thousands of families to continuing poverty and hardship .
even longtime Liberal backbench MP Russell MacLellan admits the Liberal cuts have been excessive and brutal .
will the Prime Minister give his word today that fishing families and others reeling from excessive and brutal Liberal cuts to Atlantic Canada will not continue to get short shrift ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday in this House I defended the TAGS program very strongly despite the fact that the opposition Reform Party blamed us for giving money to people who could not fish .
the program is to be terminated next year because it is a program with a deadline .
we are now reviewing the situation to see what can be done under the circumstances that will prevail next year .
we defended the program -

RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , it was earlier confirmed that a search warrant was executed at the Liberal Party headquarters in Montreal .
we now have an indication from an officer of the court in Montreal that the RCMP issued a search warrant on or about June 12 , 1997 , this time at 400 Place d ' Youville where the regional minister ' s office is located .
my question is for the President of the Treasury Board .
was this search warrant executed at his ministerial office ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I think the question is entirely irrelevant .
the RCMP may have executed a search warrant but no employee of my staff is under investigation at present .
that is the end of it .
the Conservative Party is merely trying to deflect the implication of Pierre Corbeil who happens to be the brother of an ex - Conservative minister .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to inform the minister and give him the number .
it is 500 - 26 - 007787 - 974 .
i give it to him for his information .
can the minister confirm that he will do everything necessary to assure himself that no member of the Montreal office has had contact with an individual under investigation by the name of Pierre Corbeil ?
this is very important .
the government ' s integrity is being questioned .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , an investigation is under way at the present time , as everyone knows .
an individual named Pierre Corbeil is being investigated at this time .
i called Jacques Roy of my office this morning and he told me that he had no knowledge of any investigation whatsoever being carried out on himself .
at this time , no one in my office is under investigation .
the Conservative Party ought simply to allow the investigation to run its course .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , timing is everything .
the government is now suggesting that the human resources development minister is some kind of a boy scout because he called the police on this fund - raising extortion scandal .
would a boy scout sneak through $ 3 million to the prime minister ' s riding just 24 hours before he called the police ?
my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
when the prime minister was lobbying him , when he was saying " show me the money '' , where were his boy scout ethics then ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am outraged at this kind of behaviour .
this is why Canadians are disappointed .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew :
i am treated as a boy scout .
someone who has done his duty and called in the police is now being told that this is the behaviour of a boy scout .
these people think we are boy scouts when do our duty with integrity .
this is not correct .
the prime minister has never lobbied or influenced me .
good projects are part of the role of a good member of Parliament .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , no doubt that will win a lot of points with the boss .
what an amazing coincidence .
we are starting to see how corrupt the government and its transitional jobs fund are .
when will the prime minister get to the bottom of this mess , or is it to the top ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , there is an ongoing investigation by the RCMP at this moment .
if a crime was committed the individual who committed the crime will be prosecuted .
the Minister of Human Resources Development , within three hours of learning about the accusation , informed the RCMP in writing .
the RCMP is doing its job .
if somebody has committed a crime he will have to face justice and accept the decision of the court .
that is the system .
the minister did exactly the right thing .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the President of the Treasury Board .
first , will he tell us whether or not a search of his regional office in Montreal was carried out and , if so , how can he say there is no investigation going on ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Bloc leader should get his facts straight and let the RCMP do its job .
according to my information , a warrant was issued but not executed .
why was the warrant issued but not executed ?
the answer lies with the RCMP .
to their knowledge , there is currently nobody working for me who is under investigation .
the fact that the Bloc insists on mentioning names -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Laurier - Sainte - Marie .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , will the President of the Treasury Board pledge to inform this House when a search is carried out , since a warrant was issued , as the minister himself acknowledged , will he pledge to state all the reasons why a warrant was issued to search his regional office , and why such a search was carried out ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , when a warrant is issued , the reasons are stated on it .
i should not have to tell this to the Bloc leader .
we have a duty to let the police conduct its investigation , reach its conclusions and take whatever measures are appropriate .

canada PENSION PLAN
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Liberals killed debate on the biggest tax grab in Canadian history .
will the Minister of Finance tell us today if his Liberal friends in the new Canada pension investment board will be subject to access to information guidelines ?
yes or no .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would really suggest that members of the Reform Party hire better researchers .
if they did , they would know that in terms of the investment board a nominating committee has been put together of members named by the provinces and the federal government .
the nominating committee , in turn , will name an arm ' s length board of experts .
all the hon. member has to do , rather than standing here and making a bit of a dope of himself in the House of Commons , is a little research and he would understand what is going on .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
Canadians trusted the Liberals with the current pension plan and now it is in a $ 560 billion debt hole .
trust is simply not good enough .
will the Minister of Finance display a real commitment to openness and transparency and say today that he will see that the new CPP investment board will in fact -
the Speaker :
the hon. Minister of Finance .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I suggest to the hon. member that he might want to take a look at the legislation .
the board ' s deliberations will be public .
it will report to Canadian contributors .
it will be operating the same way as any other pension fund does .
it will be an arm ' s length board from government . It will be subject to exactly the same rules as every other pension plan .
what more does the hon. member want ?

government CONTRACTS
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Public Works .
last Friday , the Minister of Public Works admitted that more than 35 % of government contracts , totalling some $ 3 billion , were untendered .
the day before last , the Auditor General of Canada gave the example of a department that achieved a 40 % saving by systematically going out to public tender .
given the party financing practices at the federal level -
the Speaker :
the hon. Minister of Public Works and Government Services .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have already answered this question in the House .
this is done for national security reasons or in an emergency .
in each case , the information is made public and everything can be checked .
the hon. member should check and see what the procedure is , in the Government of Canada , for awarding contracts .
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , will the minister admit that the fact that more than one third of all contracts are awarded without going to public tender is giving the business community the message that they better make generous donations to the ruling party if they hope to get a share of the pie ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I understand that the hon. member is trying to score political points , but if she looked at the facts , she would see that even the auditor general stated clearly in his reports that my department and this government are making tremendous progress .
when we took office , 50 % of government contracts were sole sourced .

fisheries
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , when the Liberal government introduced TAGS four years ago it promised to restructure the Atlantic fishing industry .
last night on national television the fisheries minister admitted that the Liberals " will have to face up to the fact that we still have a restructuring problem '' .
will the minister now admit to the House that the government has failed the Atlantic fishermen who turned to it for help ?
the Liberal game of TAGS has left fishermen holding the bag .
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
i hope the Reform Party will continue to assist in finding a solution to this serious problem .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , four years ago Atlantic fishermen were told that TAGS would help lead them to a new life .
instead TAGS tied them to a government program , destroyed their hopes and betrayed their trust .
will the Prime Minister show leadership now and apologize to Atlantic Canadians for betraying that trust ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , let us not exaggerate things here .
this strategy was put forward in a situation of crisis and urgency , and out of the 40,000 there are 15,000 who have been able to adjust outside of the industry .
that is something .
* * *
employment INSURANCE
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are obviously aware of what the auditor general told us in his report and we have also noticed that he asked us for certain information that already appears in the government ' s budget each year .
so we were told that they did not know what we were doing with the employment insurance surplus .
i wish to take issue with this approach , because this information is clearly indicated in the budget we table each year .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the minister should know that when it comes to credibility , in my opinion , the auditor general ' s word is certainly as good as that of the Minister of Human Resources Development right now .
in the present case , when all Canadians are wondering how there can be a $ 12 billion surplus , when seasonal workers and new entrants to the labour market are being penalized , will the minister finally agree to shed some light on the situation so that we can finally learn where the money workers contribute to the fund , money the government used to reduce the deficit , is going ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I find the remark about my integrity a bit stupid in today ' s context .
coming from the other side , however , that sort of petty partisan politics does not surprise me .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew :
but I would like to tell you that we have inherited an employment insurance system that did not work , that did not meet Canadians ' current needs .
the new system is supposed to help these people back into the job market , so that they are no longer dependent on it .
this was a very important reform , something we are taking care over to ensure that we are measuring its impact everywhere that we said we would .
that is what we are doing in the department .
* * *
the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources .
as we get closer to the Kyoto conference this December , more and more public attention is being directed at the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .
how will the minister ensure that Canada takes a balanced position going into the Kyoto conference ?
does he believe that voluntary measures will help Canada meet its emission reduction goals ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , there is indeed a vital role for voluntary action on climate change .
the members of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers have to date shown a six million tonne improvement in reducing CO 2 emissions .
pan - Canadian generated a four fold improvement between 1995 and 1996 .
the Canadian pipeline industry achieved a 2 % reduction between 1994 and 1995 .
the illustrations show that voluntary action can be very helpful .
i think the private sector should be applauded for the progress it has made .

justice
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is reprehensible and unacceptable that three rapists of a 17 - year old Quebec City girl were sentenced to just two years less a day .
what is even more despicable is that the Liberal government has encouraged our courts to grant these lenient sentences through its conditional sentencing laws which have allowed convicted rapists to walk free .
will the justice minister immediately amend the Criminal Code to deny violent offenders access to conditional sentencing or does she want convicted rapists to walk free ?
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the case that the hon. member mentions is one involving a provincial court judge in the province of Quebec .
i understand that my provincial counterpart in Quebec , the hon. attorney general , is appealing that case .
i suggest that we await the outcome of the appeal .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , a pregnant 17 - year old Quebec City girl was brutally gang raped , suspended by her feet from a balcony , sodomized and confined for 12 hours , and the judge justifies a two year sentence by saying there was no evidence of bruises or physical violence .
this is absolutely appalling and unacceptable .
i ask the justice minister what she plans to do to protect women who have been victimized , women who have been so savagely terrorized .
what does she plan to do to protect these women ?
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I agree with the hon. member that the facts of this case are particularly troubling .
i also point out to the hon. member that this is not a case of conditional sentencing and that this is a case the attorney general of Quebec , who has responsibility for this matter , has decided to appeal .
* * *
canada PENSION PLAN
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , we have heard a lot today about financial skulduggery .
my question to the Minister of Finance is about demographic skulduggery .
yesterday the Minister of Finance ordered that closure be brought against the CPP legislation , which touches the lives of every Canadian family .
it has massive financial implications to individuals , to business and to communities .
the minister said we are doing this because we will have extensive debate in committee .
was it the minister who decided this should be referred to a subcommittee of the finance committee , fobbed off to a subcommittee where a number of members will not even have voting rights ?
is this his idea of extensive debate ?
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , committees are masters of their own business .
to suggest that such decisions are taken by the government is simply incorrect .
the hon. member across knows procedure .
he has been a member long enough to know better .
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to ask a question of the Minister of Finance , who says he is very keen about the democratic system .
he wants to do the right thing .
he has indicated we want to hear extensive debate on what is the most important social program change in the last 20 years happening in this country .
will the minister do the right thing and reconsider the decision to fob this off to a subcommittee so that the entire finance committee can hold decent hearings across the country on this very important legislation ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as was mentioned , committees make their own decisions .
given that the finance committee hopefully will be involved in the most extensive prebudget consultations that we have ever seen in this country , it makes a lot of sense to refer it to a subcommittee .
i remind the hon. member that there will be the occasion in this House after report stage and at third reading stage to have full and extensive debate .
i also remind the hon. member that there was extensive debate province by province -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough .

president OF THE TREASURY BOARD
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the President of the Treasury Board has made a grave and troubling admission here today .
he told us , when pressed on the issue , that he was aware of an as yet unexecuted confidential sealed search warrant for his ministerial office .
how did the minister know ?
who told him ?
was he given the heads up on the executed warrant on Liberal Party headquarters as well ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , they themselves mentioned the existence of that search warrant .
how can they , after that , comment on it ?
the truth is the Conservative Party has been making all kinds of innuendoes , all kinds of false accusations , God knows for what purposes , but the fact is there is somebody under investigation .
we know it is Mr. Pierre Corbeil .
there is an investigation that is taking place .
i hope the results will be known very soon .
until we know these results , the opposition should be very careful about whose reputation it attacks .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabasca , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , what is at stake here is the integrity of this government and this Parliament .
the President of the Treasury Board has admitted spoke to Jacques Roy this morning .
Mr. Roy may have told him that he has been questioned by the RCMP , maybe about the fact that he could be the one who gave Mr. Corbeil , currently under investigation , confidential lists of businesses .
can the President of the Treasury Board confirm that Mr. Roy told him that ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
the right thing to do now is to wait for the investigation to run its course .
that is what integrity prescribes .

foreign INVESTMENT
Mr. Bryon Wilfert ( Oak Ridges , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister for International Trade .
every billion dollars in new investment creates 45,000 jobs over five years .
how does Canada measure up against our competition in attracting foreign investment ?
hon. Sergio Marchi ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , let me thank the hon. member for his question .
our government today received and released an independent KPMG study that shows that when we compare Canada , the United States and five leading European countries , the best cost of doing business anywhere is in this country .
* * *
INDIAN AFFAIRS
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , early in the summer an Alberta judge called for a crown investigation into the social and economic conditions of the Stony reserve because of the serious problems in his courtroom .
the minister of Indian affairs rejected his request because " it wasn ' t in the tribe ' s best interest to air the community ' s dirty laundry '' .
does the minister still believe there should be no investigation into the reserve because of dirty laundry or is it the dirty laundry of her department that she fears will be aired ?
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the issues facing the Stony people are of grave concern to me .
that is why since taking office as the minister there are three things I have done .
to deal with the present there is a third party , Coopers & Lybrand , that is managing the day to day operations of the First Nation .
to deal with the past , a forensic audit is being completed by KPMG , looking at the band ' s records and the records of my department to ensure things have been managed appropriately .
to deal with the future I am working with the Minister of Health and the province to make sure the programs available to support the Stony people are managed and developed in appropriate ways .
i would ask the hon. member to -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Drummond .

aboriginal PEOPLES
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Health .
the exploitation of aboriginals by health professionals is a problem that has been known for ten years .
how can the minister explain to Canadians that his department has not yet found one single solution to this problem ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we have been working with aboriginal communities and with my provincial counterparts .
we have been working for the past ten years to meet this challenge .
we will continue doing so .
by the end of the year , we will have new technologies in place across Canada to help the authorities find instances of drug abuse .

business OF THE HOUSE
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask the House leader the nature of government business for the rest of this week and for the week when we reconvene .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , tomorrow the House will consider a motion to refer to committee before second reading Bill C - 9 , the marine legislation .
this legislation passed the House in the last Parliament .
we will then rise for the Thanksgiving adjournment .
i do not propose any other legislation for tomorrow .
if there is time available between the tax treaty bill and the customs tariff bill , after completing the latter we will consider Bill C - 5 , the co - operatives legislation , second reading of Bill C - 8 , respecting the Yukon , and second reading of Bill C - 6 , respecting the Mackenzie valley .
Tuesday , October 21 and Thursday , October 23 shall be allotted days .

privilege
introduction OF PUBLIC BILLS IN SENATE
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a question of privilege in regard to the matter of introducing government public bills in the Senate .
my leader raised the issue with you under the provisions of Standing Order 52 .
it should be noted that since my leader ' s application for a special debate , a third bill has appeared on the Senate order paper today .
i bring this to your attention at this time , not as a matter of ministerial responsibility and not as a matter of debate , but as a matter of our procedures and practices which only you , Mr. Speaker , can entertain under the guise of privilege .
the situation is unique to this Parliament , so I ask that you be patient and consider my arguments carefully .
this situation is unique because three out of the five recognized parties in the House of Commons do not have representation in the other place .
the Prime Minister ' s use of the Senate as the first house to consider his government ' s legislation is insulting and offensive to the dignity of this elected House .
it is also disrespectful to the new political reality of this House and its members .
Beauchesne ' s sixth edition , citation 28 , states " Parliament is a court with respect to its own privileges and dignity and the privileges of its members '' .
in Erskine May ' s 21 st edition , at page 115 , it states that an offence for contempt " may be treated as contempt even though there is no precedent for the offence '' .
this is the first time that the Senate will consider government public bills prior to the House at a time when the party representation in the Senate is so out of sync with the wishes of the electorate .
while there is clearly no precedent for this situation , we are not precluded from finding that the action of the Prime Minister is in contempt of this House .
Mr. Speaker , I refer you to Beauchesne ' s citation 3 which describes some elements of the Constitution Act as follows " If the electorate so wishes , the system presupposes an opposition ready and willing to attack the government in an attempt to have its legislation altered or rejected '' .
our system presupposes that the elected members be the real opposition to government legislation .
the electorate has elected its government and its opposition .
the role of the Senate is for sober second thought and must not be the front line of opposition to ensure government accountability .
some might argue that the procedure the Prime Minister is using is in order .
what they fail to recognize is the changing circumstances that guide our practices .
i refer you , Mr. Speaker , to Beauchesne ' s sixth edition , citation 11 , which reads " The House is to adjust the interpretation of its precedents and tradition in the light of changing circumstances '' .
in conclusion , we claim the right to consider government public bills first .
the Prime Minister ' s conduct in introducing government legislation in the Senate is offensive to the dignity of this elected House , disrespectful to all of its members and is a contempt of this House .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to say a word in support of the question of privilege before the House and to welcome the Reform Party to the feeling we have been having for years .
there has always been something out of sync and out of character in the history of the CCF and the NDP in that we have never had representation in the other place , nor did we want it .
it is even more pronounced now that three parties in the House have no representation in the other place .
that is the new fact which makes this a very legitimate question of privilege .
the other point I want to make is that we also have a duty in representing our constituents to offer constructive criticism to government bills .
since three parties do not have a voice in the other place , that is very difficult to do at the important initial stage .
i conclude by saying that there is a history of technical bills being introduced in the other place .
i believe that practice will now be expedited by the government .
just because those bills have been introduced in the Senate in the past does not make it right .
there has been an evolution of thought in the country over the last number of years and people want more input .
they want their elected members of Parliament to play a more meaningful role .
in view of that fact , we must have evolution in the practices of the House as well .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , on the same question of privilege , I think you should give positive consideration to the proposed motion because , in our evolving parliamentary system , it is extremely important to give more authority to the elected and less to those who are backward - looking and who do not reflect today ' s reality .
i think that elected representatives as a whole and the people of Quebec and Canada want above all for decisions on legislation to be the responsibility of the House of Commons and that this be the only way to proceed .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wish to add to this point of privilege .
it may be a small thing to some people , but normally in the course of our day ' s Routine Proceedings , bills are routinely brought before the House of Commons , the elected house in this Parliament , for printing and for examination .
the bills which are introduced in the Senate are not introduced that way to this body .
the standing orders have gone through an evolution since I have been here .
for example , on referral after first reading , we have tried to increase the influence of this place and of ordinary members on legislation in committees and otherwise in an attempt to bring the new political reality we are all talking about to bear on the 1990 s and into the next millennium .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , if this was not so silly it would be -
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
hon. Don Boudria :
hon. members across the way have , in fact , tried two methods , each one as unsuccessful as the previous .
today there was a call for an alleged emergency debate on the same issue and now an alleged question of privilege .
there is nothing before the House today on which a question of privilege can be raised .
hon. members will know that any proceeding in the other place is totally out of bounds in terms of raising it in this House .
we all know that is the case .
it may well happen some time in the future that the House will receive a message from the other place informing us that it has passed a bill , or a number of bills for that matter , and inviting us to consider those measures .
some of those measures will be sponsored by ministers and set down for consideration under Government Orders .
the standing orders of the House explicitly provide for the introduction of Senate public bills and the subsequent consideration thereof .
as a matter of fact , I will read the Projected Order of Business for today .
members I am sure will be familiar with the document .
tabling of Documents , Statements by Ministers and so on .
just before Motions is First Reading of Senate Public Bills .
this is today ' s Order Paper for the House of Commons .
therefore , under today ' s standing orders this applies .
all measures will be considered by this House in the same manner , whether they are initiated here and debated in the other place subsequently , or initiated in the other place and debated here subsequently .
the alleged argument made by members is that somehow this sequence constitutes a question of privilege .
Mr. Jack Ramsay :
what are you afraid of ?
the fix is in .
hon. Don Boudria :
Mr. Speaker , we just heard a remark from someone who I think had better brush up on the rules .
whether a bill is introduced in one House or the other , they are of course debated in both Houses .
it is also a reversal of policy for the Reform Party .
i invite hon. members , especially him , to pay attention because in the last parliament and in all parliaments we have had Senate public bills debated in the House .
in the last parliament government Bill S - 2 respecting a tax convention , which was very similar to one of the bills presently before the Senate , was passed without any recorded division .
in other words members of the Reform Party voted for it .
there were two divisions on that bill .
there were two division bells .
one was on an amendment proposed by a member on this side of the House .
it is recorded at page 2020 of the Journals of October 17 , 1995 that Reformers thought so highly of the Senate ' s legislative work they voted against the proposed amendment .
more important , this is against an amendment proposed by a member of the House and in favour of the version proposed by the other place .
as well , on page 2021 of the Journals for that day we see on the motion to concur in the Senate government bill that the Reform Party voted in favour of the bill , once again telling us that the procedure is quite correct .
in the last parliament Reformers were so comfortable with government bills being introduced in the Senate that they specifically voted on them when division bells were rung .
i draw the attention of the Speaker to the October 17 , 1995 Journals at page 2022 .
in that division a number of Reform members voted for the bill : the hon. member for St. Albert , the hon. member for Kootenay - Columbia , the hon. member for Calgary - Nose Hill , the hon. member for Macleod , the hon. member for Cariboo - Chilcotin and a number of others .
all these members and a number of others from the Reform Party voted in favour of a division supporting a Senate bill and against an amendment made by a member of the House .
they cannot today claim that the Senate procedure is illegitimate when they fought so valiantly in favour of it .
this is not a question of privilege .
this is a concocted argument by the Reform Party in a desperate attempt to find some way of getting pubic attention .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have several points that will constitute new information to assist you in making your decision .
the House leader ' s defence of this practice just given rested on two points .
the first one , and he quoted a number of references to support it , is that what happens in the Senate is out of bounds in the House .
that notion is completely out of sync with the reality in the country .
what if our constituents want us to make what goes on in the Senate the business of the House ?
are we not under an obligation as members to bring that to the House , including the relationship between the House and the Senate ?
surely the will of our constituents takes precedence over these earlier precendents he quoted .
the second point is that he made reference to the last parliament and instances in which members of the current opposition received and supported bills that had originated in the Senate .
we simply reply to that by saying that was then and this is now .
the composition of the House is moving further and further away from the composition of the Senate .
at the last election the composition of the House passed the point where three of the parties , including the official opposition in the House , are not represented at all in that other chamber .
both of the arguments raised by the House leader are extremely weak .
we are simply standing before you , Mr. Speaker , to claim the right to consider government public bills first in this place .
the Speaker :
as always when questions of privilege are raised I am very much interested in them and how they affect the House .
you have empowered your Speaker to specifically interpret the rules of the House and to give rulings on the rules we have agreed on as an assembly of the House of Commons collectively .
i am looking at the standing orders that were referred to by the hon. Leader of the Opposition and by the government House leader .
standing Order 69 ( 2 ) at page 36 reads :
when any bill is brought from the Senate , the question " That this bill be read a first time " shall be deemed carried , without debate , amendment or question put .
members have asked me to rule on a procedure on which the House collectively has decided .
unless and until the House collectively decides that it wants to change the standing orders , as your Speaker I am bound to follow the rules .
i would rule that in this particular case there is no question of privilege .

points OF ORDER
comments DURING ORAL QUESTION PERIOD
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my point of order refers to question period and a question raised by the Liberal member for Oak Ridges and directed to the Minister for International Trade .
could the Speaker rule whether the question was in order ?
he asked the Minister for International Trade how Canada compared to other countries with respect to investment and jobs .
everybody who reads their own briefing notes and papers that all members get would know that we compare quite favourably .
i wonder what the purpose of his question is .
perhaps he did not read his briefing notes .
the Speaker :
with respect to all members of Parliament , I am not here to judge the quality of a question or the quality of an answer .
i am here to see to it that a question is properly put and that the minister , the government or the person to whom it is directed has a chance to answer .
what the member is asking me to do is outside the purview of the Speaker .
if that were the case , should I judge on the quality of all questions in the House ?
i urge all hon. members to pose questions that will be of interest to most Canadians , or at least to a certain part of the country , perhaps a constituency where a specific answer is needed on something .
i decline to ever judge on the quality of either a question or an answer .
member FOR SURREY CENTRAL
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
during the S . O . 31 period the member for Surrey Central gave a tribute to his Sikh heritage and to the anniversary of the Sikh presence in Canada .
unfortunately both the announcement of his name and his riding on the television screen were wrong .
it was the member for Surrey Central who made that statement .
the Speaker :
if something like that occurred I accept responsibility for the simple reason that I -
an hon. member :
it was my fault .
the Speaker :
then it was the fault of the hon. member for Elk Island and you ought to have a word with him .
government ORDERS
supply
ALLOTED DAY - FEDERAL PARTY FINANCING
the House resumed consideration of the motion and the amendment .
i would ask you to please continue the debate calmly and peacefully .
did he say consult Canadians or insult Canadians ?
the truth hurts , doesn ' t it ?
the Chair is mindful of the multiple responsibilities , duties and constituency related activities of all members and of the importance they play in the work of every member of Parliament .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate both of my colleagues who spoke for the first time in this House .
why would he not visit the TransAlta Utilities mine site west of Edmonton , Alberta where tremendous work has been done and the coal mine has been reclaimed to a state that is far more productive and just as aesthetically acceptable as the ground and the country ever was before .
to say " Don ' t put money into the CPP " is to say " Low income seniors , we don ' t care about you '' .
trade
and even more fundamental than that , does the hon. member acknowledge the existence of the Quebec people as a people ?
he has reported to me and I will be making a statement on or before October 7 .
there is a lot of bragging on the other side about the importance of the prime minister opening these doors .
why did the province first refuse and then later accept federal government assistance ?
i think that says something .
Mr. Walt Lastewka
what you tell me about the equality of people and how we are going to maintain basic national -
this is what I heard when I was campaigning and talking to these people in businesses in Lethbridge .
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) :
i give my word to those who elected me , and to all those I represent here in Parliament , that I will carry out my public duties with deep and sincere respect for my new office .
this bill would make certain that those individuals who wish to have the choice to use or not use milk produced in this way would have the product labelled .
i do not know how much evidence the Department of Finance needs from its own officials to establish the connection that payroll taxes kill jobs and they kill them by the thousands .
the throne speech mentioned a deep concern for aboriginal issues .
to these people , that is more important than making sure children eat every day .
the Deputy Speaker :
in fact the Liberal fundraiser in that area is now under criminal investigation .
we are seeing the very positive results today .
forty - nine per cent Canada wide and fifty - six per cent in B.C. said " Don ' t use our tax dollars on these pork barrel federal - provincial arrangements '' .
their potential is as limitless as Canada itself .
while this appeal is ongoing we will not be commenting on the particulars of this case no matter how many times members of the opposition ask .
i understand that the member is at least three minutes over his time .
we believe there must be extensive reform in that area .
hon. members across are heckling , very rudely I might add , at this moment but they should be listening in particular to the judgment that Mr. Speaker will no doubt be giving in a few moments .
i am anxious because I have seen the amount of pressure that those with economic power can place on government .
that is a commitment that goes to the core of the Liberal Party .
our children ask little of us .
unfortunately I do not have time to expand on all the issues I wanted to cover .
the hon. member ' s point is well taken .
the Speech from the Throne outlined Canada ' s ability to trade with and draw investment from all parts of the globe .
Mr. Daniel Turp :
let us respect who we are and where we are going .
we also say if we take the premiers seriously that the government should develop a deeper commitment to public consultation on unity initiatives .
it was before he was even born , but I have six other children who were already born .
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) :
they want a voluntary wheat board , a wheat board that can market all grain and get the best price for them .
Mr. Speaker , I did not quite catch what the member said .
does the government intend to take the necessary action to ensure that the plan is properly administered , both with respect to its information systems and with respect to the criteria for certain benefits , including disability benefits ?
my question is for the solicitor general .
we have promised in writing that seniors in our plan will be guaranteed the pension they are already receiving .
madam Speaker , I congratulate you on your appointment .
so , for the first time , the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t gave the Government of Quebec , of whatever stripe , freedom from the control of the big financiers .
if the committee were to undertake a prolonged and detailed review of the amendment , then the separatist government in Quebec and the separatists here in the House would probably use this as an example of the federation being dysfunctional .
Mr. Tom Wappel
reformers get old and want to have pensions .
Mrs. Monique Guay :
the Deputy Speaker :
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
we would like to see some control over costs that way .
i certainly do not support what he is saying .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
madam Speaker , if I understand correctly , we are speaking of the 1988 election of Mr. Lucien Bouchard , when he was in the Conservative party .
Mr. Speaker , if the minister does not know where these passports are , how can he be determining that they are forged ?
it is indeed a great honour to be entrusted with this task .
we have to ask ourselves what kind of a country we have that does not care well for its elderly .
if Quebeckers show enough faith in Canada to elect a federalist government , that faith must be rewarded .
was he given the heads up on the executed warrant on Liberal Party headquarters as well ?
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
under this provision the administrator of the plan must be designated .
Mr. Lee Morrison :
therefore I seek the unanimous leave of the House to table a sworn affidavit from senior customs officer Dennis Coffey with respect to his appeal to the Public Service Employment Commission Appeal Board which substantiates the allegations which he has made .
they are part of the knowledge based economy which has transformed Ottawa from a predominantly government town to Canada ' s high technology capital .
the throne speech quotes Sir Wilfrid Laurier .
he promised a 50 percent profit on money in 45 days , double that in six months .
yet in the same breath when I left the bureaucrat in question was willing to give that information to those very few band members .
in concluding , I move :
the foreign property limits of the pension funds will also apply to the CPP fund .
some hon. members :
again it is mentioned .
cynicism would be replaced by respect and we would be doing the job that the majority of voters thinks we should be doing .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member ' s knowledge of history of the TAGS program is defective .
Mr. Speaker , it gives me great pleasure to be here this week and also to congratulate you on your appointment to the Speaker ' s chair .
they add up to a Canada that has the institutional arrangements to make that practical .
paired
putting computers in schools and hooking them up to the Internet does not do this .
i would like to know whether the member for Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke acknowledges Quebecers as a people and their presence here for 350 years .
Mr. Speaker , it is not up to me to determine the tuition fees in the provinces .
they were campaigning that they would not be part of that plan .
i suspect , knowing his constituency well , that he deals with a great number of immigration problems .
he was first elected in 1953 and re - elected in 1957 , during which time he actively articulated the needs and concerns of his constituents .
most of us here campaigned on this .
you know that I was very pleased by your nomination .
if that is not evidence enough that high taxes kill jobs , I do not know what is .
i am pleased the system is working well .
the simple truth is that farmers will not substantially benefit from the legislation , and the Liberals know it .
meanwhile that commission , the CRTC , has an implied stated agenda to create large players and protect these large players from competition .
national DEFENCE
in the period of the existence of Canada and going back to 1861 , I suppose every political party has been tarnished and sullied by a financial scandal of one kind or another .
in order to sustain that program , in order to ensure that we have a viable pension system , someone had to take the bull by the horns .
where is the motion in the House to amend the standing orders so that the defeat of a government motion does not result in the defeat of the government unless specifically designated a vote of non - confidence ?
- the events necessarily incidental to petitions , questions , and notices of motions in Parliament - are all events which are part of the " proceedings of Parliament . "
his position on health care is untenable .
main ESTIMATES , 1997 - 98
it must be addressed .
the government ' s failure to act on our charter of rights , its failure to pay the public service workers money due as equal pay for equal work , its failure to treat women fairly is despicable .
however at the same time , they are saying that the board of directors for the Canadian Wheat Board cannot be provided that kind of protection .
Mr. Bob Kilger
surely this is such a sensitive issue that it deserves a clear answer as to what has actually happened .
* * *
when we talk to seniors they are concerned about the future .
he even went on to add : " Everyone does '' .
the government has not assured Nova Scotia that the fishery in Nova Scotia will survive .
the throne speech speaks to those obligations .
a strong and prosperous community is safe and a safe community will be strong and thriving .
as far as pay equity is concerned at leat , if he really has the cause of women at heart , I think he should sit down with the minister -
secession , no , no and no .
will the minister confirm in this House that his government is refusing to withdraw from policing Montreal airports over a flag , which has nothing to do with efficiency or security ?
today , there is a surplus .
let us talk for a minute about the disability portion of the plan .
it is still spending $ 5,000 a year more than what it is taking in .
an hon. member :
Mr. Speaker , the throne speech contains not one word about resolving the Pacific salmon dispute .
i urge the government to be very clear .
canada provides our common space and our common means for realizing our potential .
at the recent Women Leaders ' Network for APEC Economies held in Ottawa , it was noted that 700,000 companies in Canada are owned by women and that they employ 1.7 million people , which is greater than the Canadian Business top 100 companies .
i want to indicate that I am in support of the motion which has been brought forward by the Bloc .
in the span of roughly 35 years , Inuit went from igloos to houses , from dog teams to airplanes , and still kept their culture alive because we still use igloos and dog teams .
soon we will refer this to committee before second reading .
super RRSPs would supplement rather than replace the existing system of optional RRSPs .
after four and a half years of Liberal government the economy is in better shape than it has been in in a long time .
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
Mr. Speaker , first I would like to say how grateful we are that the Transportation Safety Board has given a preliminary report on the unfortunate crash at Biggar .
so , the bill proposes the establishment of the CPP investment board , which will be quite similar to Quebec ' s Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement .
Mr. Speaker , neither British Columbians nor I are calling for secession .
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
this approach does not mean being soft on crime nor letting criminals go free .
whereas the federal government refuses to initiate a proper investigation into the events surrounding the tax free transfer to the United States of $ 2 billion from a family trust on December 23 , 1991 ;
i would find at this point that this is not a question of privilege .
i will do everything in my power to see that we share this future together .
Mr. Robert D . Nault
that is back to the past , the Archie Bunkers of Canada .
if we set national goals and establish clear targets , we can indeed make a difference .
hon. Don Boudria :
* * *
Mr. Speaker , the foreign affairs minister said in 1993 that limiting debate brings this House into disgrace .
members will recall that , when Canadians and Quebecers were asked to vote on the Charlottetown accord in 1992 , Quebecers rejected the accord as clearly not enough , while the rest of Canada rejected it because , in their estimation , it was giving far too much to the people of Quebec .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
colleagues , in choosing me as your Speaker you have vested me with , in many ways , awesome authority .
the Speaker
i want to be crystal clear on this point .
we are not going to let the Prime Minister and his finance minister get credit for the sacrifices made by others .
Mr. Jack Ramsay :
Mr. Speaker , I know that time is short so I will simply move to one of the member ' s statements and that was that there is only one taxpayer .
the hon. member talks about the deficit .
Mr. Speaker , that certainly opens up a great debate .
constitutional change is a necessity in this country .
in Saint - Eustache - Sainte - Th 茅 r 猫 se , the rate is 14 per cent .
the government is selling off all the housing of CMHC .
the Speaker :
* * *
considering the situation that exists in what has to be the wealthiest country in the world , would the hon. member not agree that this is actually , to quote the Catholic bishops , a form of child abuse for a government to allow this condition to continue ?
we know that in Europe , the exceptionally high unemployment rates in countries such as Germany and France are due to what economists call , and this is an understatement , the labour market ' s lack of flexibility .
the hon. member opposite has some nerve , Mr. Speaker .
there is a direct correlation between the type of education a person has and the type of job they get .
we will all miss Stanley Knowles greatly , his warmth , his humour , his fierce unyielding dedication to justice and equality and his unparalleled expertise in the rules and procedures that govern Parliament .
QUEBEC PREMIER
Mr. Lorne Nystrom
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire
on May the 29 , 1996 the former justice minister stood in this House and stated :
if I consider the number of people who worked for me as I needed them for drywalling , roofing or some other components , it worked out to be the equivalent of about 10 full - time positions .
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau
it is intended to catch those foreign fishermen and flags of convenience that try to catch fish stocks that straddle our 200 mile fishing zone .
employment INSURANCE
there is a tremendous contradiction in the NDP platform .
petitions
i congratulate the leader of the Conservative Party and his colleagues .
foreign AFFAIRS
we are returning to the 1970 s and the sorts of supposed solutions that the government at that time brought forward .
while the Clerk is unsealing the ballots , may I remind members that the ballots for the third vote will be a different colour and that the list of names of candidates on this ballot has been placed in each polling station .
what we have is a government that wants to bring in a tax hike right after an election .
i hereby move , seconded by the hon. member for Beauce , that the following address be presented to His Excellency the Governor General of Canada :
Mr. Speaker , I want to thank the Prime Minister for his kind words in welcoming me back to the House .
member spoke in Inuktitut . ]
consequently he sits on this side of the House because the Liberal Party threw him out .
first of all , I would mention that in New Zealand the type of government he is calling a conservative government which was in power just before the crisis was reached was known as the National Party .
residents also discussed the importance of preserving and improving our health care system and expressed their support for an efficient , affordable and effective pharmacare and home care programs .
it is naive to think otherwise .
as Liberal spending power is legendary , the government will announce straight faced and glowing with pride the ever increasing budget of the Canada Council .
the hon. member has not raised a point of order .
Mr. Inky Mark ( Dauphin - Swan River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I ask that all Notices of Motions for the Production of Papers be allowed to stand .
on Monday we will commence second reading of Bill C - 2 , the Canada pension plan investment board legislation .
we had to make difficult choices about which way to go but I am proud to say that our destination is in sight .
introduction and first reading
we are a rural riding that has made and will make an enormous contribution to Canada as a whole .
the fund is jointly administered by the federal and provincial governments for the benefit of citizens , not for the benefit of governments .
we have people from all parts of the world coming together in Canada and building a nation characterized by tolerance , understanding , generosity and prosperity .
it is an excellent example of people taking pride in their heritage and working together for the benefit of the entire community .
these are not just words that are thrown around lightly .
Mr. Bill Blaikie
the members of the Bloc Quebecois , this morning , are saying that the system must be changed and replaced by a system where political parties will not allowed to receive contributions from corporations .
this government has no mandate to impose an outright payroll tax .
this is monumental .
in 1996 at the Federation of Canadian Municipalities convention in Calgary , many including myself heard the prime minister acknowledge the importance of municipal governments and that it was time to recognize the municipal governments in their right .
an hon. member :
do members know why they are going out of wheat and barley production and the acreage is going down ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
now on the GST , of course the Liberals promised to scrap , abolish and get rid of the GST , which they did not do .
my mother and father and six of us moved to this country in 1956 .
is she following the policies of the New Democratic premier or is she announcing a different policy here ?
the premiers ' framework of principles for discussion mentioned equality five times .
therefore how we deal with this both in terms of process and in terms of substance is very important .
in my family every spare penny my parents could save went to education .
it makes common sense to do it that way , and not the whole lot .
the main complaint is the lengthy process and red tape which applicants must go through before a final decision is rendered .
Mr. Paul DeVillers :
that way of doing things was also used in $ 2,000 - a - plate dinners attended by the likes of Jacques Parizeau , Bernard Landry , Jean Campeau .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie ( Louis - H 茅 bert , BQ ) :
today the issue is the untendered contracts .
this strategy , which creates work experience , is doing well .
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen ( Windsor - St.
Mr. Speaker , I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues that our prime minister visited Vancouver last week to launch Canada ' s hosting of the Asia - Pacific economic co - operation forum , also known as APEC '97 .
prayers
he always took a keen interest in the status of the French minority in New Brunswick and throughout the country , and of the English minority in Quebec .
has he heard about IRAP which has several people out there advising and assisting people who want to develop new programs and projects ?
Mr. Gerry Byrne ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources , Lib . ) :
i know that I and my fellow New Democrats bring back to this House a value and tradition that has almost disappeared , a quest for social justice and social equality and a voice for those who have been silenced and shut out .
Mr. Speaker , today we read of the sad and unfortunate conclusions of a one - time prominent Conservative senator who , having spent a lifetime trying to change the federation from within , is now reduced to bitter mumblings about B.C. ' s separation from Canada .
now , in reading the throne speech to keep myself awake between coffees , I see in black and white that the federal government is prepared to form a partnership with the Quebec government to celebrate the new millennium .
more Canadian companies are selling more goods and services to the world than ever before .
some hon. members :
Ms. Angela Vautour
the health care system in this country is suffering .
as a B.C. member of Parliament , I was honoured to join him at various functions .
it is important that as members we try to at least deal in reality .
are they or are they not running businesses by employing personal care givers at home ?
given the recent massacres of innocent civilians in Algeria , the international community must take concerted action to help the Algerian population , which is the target of these barbaric acts .
bill C - 219 .
we are going to give them the tools to meet the 21 st century .
i am a teacher and I would love to have an overhead projector here .
because the throne speech , just like the first throne speech we heard in this House , tells us that the federal government will be barging into areas of provincial jurisdiction , including education .
some hon. members :
maybe we can find a way to work together to ensure that does not happen in the future .
they decide when to launch actions against individuals and they decide when to settle out of court .
this person is suffering with terminal cancer and is still unable to get disability benefits .
legislative COUNSEL
coincidentally , that is exactly on what we campaigned .
at the same time health transfers have fallen by about $ 7 billion a year .
we want to know if he agrees with the leader of the official opposition , who is against any recognition of distinct society .
they are going down the Niagara River .
while there is clearly no precedent for this situation , we are not precluded from finding that the action of the Prime Minister is in contempt of this House .
there is a social program in every pot .
i think it is necessary to tell members of the House how he won .
i regret the fact that time does not allow me to comment on all aspects of what I truly believe is an enlightened framework , but there are a few more points I would like to mention .
let us celebrate what we have done but keep in mind that we have more to do .
by mounting these initiatives the government is providing fitting leadership which facilitates lasting job creation in the private sector .
for everyone ' s information , well over 9,500 schools and 1,200 public libraries have been connected .
Mr. Art Hanger
in the last four years under this Prime Minister the Canadian public has created over 970,000 new jobs .
at the time , the Prime Minister was quick to criticize another government .
however , I can tell you how disgusted I am with the government for moving closure on what is probably the most important bill it will bring before parliament in this mandate .
i want to also make it very clear that the reason why we have this so - called surplus is that we have learned from the mistakes of the previous government .
therefore , the Government will bring frankness and clarity to any debate that puts into question the future existence or unity of Canada .
and Canada will continue to work toward an accompanying international strategy to help land mine victims recover and civilian populations reclaim their land from these mines .
the results were great .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the future federal minister of education , whoever he may be .
they do not have to ask themselves the question - they are a distinct society , period .
the golf course was developed a long time ago and it has been made adequate for golfers .
let us remember that this government in 1993 introduced the most regressive social policy in the history of this country , the Canada health and social transfer , and took the single biggest bite out of health care in the history of medicare .
they do not want to talk about the fact that in 1993 unemployment rates were 11.5 percent and today that are at 9 percent and dropping .
we are also going to create the investment board .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
it has to do with the expression " picking the pockets of Canadians '' .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
is the member aware that when the Liberal government took over in 1993 the Conservative government had it pegged at $ 3.30 per $ 100 ?
the CPP over the last few years has been jeopardized by inadequate contribution levels and inefficient plan management .
not only do we need to understand them .
the question as asked is out of order .
its stand contradicts the Reform Party ' s commitment to represent its constituents .
six provinces have an average of 73,900 people per MP .
the liability comes back to the farmer who has entrusted that employee with the grain .
Mr. Speaker , I have had the good fortune in my experience in life to have visited and worked in the Yukon , the Northwest Territories and other parts of Canada .
we are now in the 98 th straight month of unemployment over 9 percent , the longest string of high unemployment since the great depression .
if I could ask the indulgence of the hon. member for Wild Rose , I would like to hear something from the minister who is involved .
at the end of this debate I trust that Canadians will see and understand that Bill C - 2 is poor legislation and that it should not be passed .
it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out who had the passports .
as I understand the rules , the purpose of an amendment to an amendment is to improve the original amendment and it implies that we agree with it .
he is now bragging about his new amigos in Chile .
however , imagination is no substitute for reality , and the reality is this : when citizens stand together , we feel stronger as a country .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
( motion agreed to )
there is no escaping the needs of a growing population .
income TAXES
indeed it is our responsibility now to move forward and to recognize that young Canadians , old Canadians , seniors , children , Canadians who have had to pay the price get some of the benefits from this dividend .
in light of the fact that there is an estimated 15 million children working in Southeast Asia and in light of the fact that the APEC conference seeks to increase our trade with these countries , will the minister use the weight of his office to pass comparable legislation that would outlaw the importation and sale of goods manufactured by child labour ?
but its B.C. cousins are taking these new political liaisons to astonishing new levels .
i appreciate also that the minister will get back to us promptly .
they want us to speak about Abitibi .
will they at least allow those members of Parliament who want to opt out of the super rich gold plated pension plan the opportunity to do so ?
the Speaker :
i would suggest to the hon. member and other members of the Reform Party that it would be to their credit if they would also take up the issue of fair taxation for Canadians , instead of their code word " cutbacks " which are hurting the poor people in Canada .
what I am suggesting to the government is not to just keep going down the same old road of poor plan design and eventual failure and crisis but to look around , look at new ideas and adopt a plan that would deliver fairness to future generations of Canadians .
it is to those federal contributions that we will direct our attention and on which we will focus our efforts .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
i know all hon. members will accept this in the spirit with which I say it .
speech FROM THE THRONE
let no factious men put it asunder .
it is an agreement which has not been debated in the House .
Ms. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) :
i wonder if the hon. member has read any of the studies .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the prime minister .
the government will continue after all to guarantee the wheat board ' s initial price on grain purchased from farmers .
we share ancestors that sailed by the shadow of the Quebec citadel , some stopping , most going onward to Montreal or beyond .
the population of this fine North Shore riding , the country of Gilles Vigneault , which is known for its vast spaces and its people ' s joie de vivre , has staunchly and proudly supported the sovereignist option .
speaking of understanding and this understanding attitude I welcome - we really need it in this House - is the minister prepared to recognize , in the same positive and open manner , that we are a people ?
the RCMP learned about these illegal Liberal fundraising tactics in March from a boy scout in the Ministry of Human Resources Development .
in many cases benefit payouts would not change at all .
sitting Resumed
when will we get agreements to protect workers , the environment and the public interest ?
at times it may seem a daunting task .
he is a quality replacement for Beno 卯 t Tremblay , a member of Parliament who represented Quebec in the past .
Methinks the lady doth protest too much .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
he also told the Prime Minister , or his office - which amounts to the same thing , for when the Prime Minister ' s chief of staff is informed of something , he immediately tells it to the Prime Minister .
introduction and first reading
the Minister of Industry and his colleagues are now responding to the second task with their jobs strategy .
the auditor general pointed out that the lack of inventory control at national defence cost the government $ 1.7 billion .
eventually , this board will control enormous amounts of money , particularly in a country with such a small capital pool .
we will see in real dollar terms a continual drop in funding from this government to the provinces , thereby jeopardizing even further the future of medicare in this country .
there is no question that we should give them all of the afforded protection we can give them so that they will provide that service well .
we took the challenge of government program review , the challenge of getting government right , and we met it .
- finance , Vote 30
Mr. Reg Alcock
in addition to Canadian values , much of our success is based on at least four principles of Canadian liberalism as laid out by Sir Wilfrid Laurier .
members will know that I introduced the very same bill in the last Parliament .
the government ' s integrity is being questioned .
again , in this bill there is no reference to trying to look at the economic priorities of the country and investing in the domestic economy in this new fund .
the Deputy Speaker :
some hon. members :
i appreciate the fact that the two parties are fighting over an opportunity to respond to some of my comments .
house OF COMMONS
recognizing the importance of the family unit , this would have a positive impact on Canada ' s social climate .
that is probably why so we elected so few .
there is one line about tax relief and debt reduction .
this is not simply a theoretical exercise for him .
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , far from making any threats , the government is calling for calm and democratic debate of very serious matters :
madam Speaker , the new member for Bourassa , who until recently was the assistant director general of his party , the Liberal Party of Canada , in Quebec said it would be effective and desirable to forge bonds of trust between him and his voters , between the Liberal Party of Canada and Canadian voters .
the government announced TAGS in April 1994 and promised $ 1.9 billion in income support and adjustment measures under the program .
it is a travesty .
canada pension plan contribution rates will increase in steps to 9.9 % by 2003 or 4.95 % for each employer and employee and then remain unchanged instead of reaching the 14.2 % projected by the chief actuary for the year 2030 .
i commend the Prime Minister for partnering with the private sector and leading trade missions abroad .
with respect to application of the test of the rule of law , the government says that section 43 of the 1982 Constitution Act is the appropriate amending formula to apply to the Quebec resolution .
miss Deborah Grey :
Mr. Jim Hart
are hon. members rising on questions or comments ?
Quebeckers deserve better than this deplorable colonialist spectacle .
Mr. Speaker , I do not agree with the preamble to the question .
and Mr. Robinson having withdrawn : ]
we are working to further their progress toward achieving self - government .
they maintain we need a strong central government to carry out such initiatives .
Mr. Speaker , the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , UNESCO , designated October 5 , 1997 as world teachers day , a day to honour the teaching profession .
some hon. members :
the federal government is , therefore , maintaining considerable control over the Canadian Wheat Board .
* * *
the Government of Quebec will therefore recognize , and quite rightly , a proportionately higher number of disabled people .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
liar .
even if we hold spending the fact of the matter is that people are growing older .
that has been done .
our part of the bargain , if we are to retain that support , is that we along with the professionals who are the health care providers and in partnership with the provinces who deliver the services , must ensure that Canadians will have access to the highest quality possible in health care as and when it is needed .
bill C - 215 .
i think that is a given .
the official opposition does understand the importance of supporting our allies in the fight against terrorism .
Mr. Speaker , it is almost a joy to have the hon. member asking me what we will do with the surplus in future years .
speaker ' s Ruling
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
i also remind the member that he does not represent the entire Quebec province but one riding .
perhaps it is a misunderstanding of the language .
i would also like to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on your appointment .
i know we share in the common view that short term pain sometimes means long term gain , but in this instance we are not talking about gain for some .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
absolute nonsense .
the assets not immediately required to pay benefits are placed in non - negotiable instruments issued by the provinces .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
this is a city which returned a Reform member to every riding in the last federal election .
this is the worst it has ever been for Quebec . Several experts agree it is far less than Meech and even less than Charlottetown .
i would say to hon. members that perhaps CPP stands for a commitment to Paul ' s plan .
Mr. Speaker , the very day I learned of , or heard of , certain allegations of misappropriation of funds in the matter of which we speak , I immediately informed the RCMP of them , requesting it to investigate , but I did not inform the solicitor general of the day .
i was intrigued to see his reply to a question about getting the government - I do not think I can say this - to rethink their insistence on burdening small business owners with unreasonably high EI premiums .
is the hon. member prepared to do that ?
there was representation from all the provinces and territories .
the first issue I would like to deal with in Bill C - 4 before us today is that of the inclusion clause .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
it would be foolish to deny the right to get us our innovations , our products , our resources and our gas to the appropriate markets .
as party critic , and as a young person myself , I find it interesting that the focus is on the future to ensure that future generations will have the same rights as today ' s generation .
it is a tax because it is mandatory .
the first measure that the government undertook in 1993 was to stop an increase scheduled by the Tory government before we were elected .
there is really no need for us to delve into that further at this time .
hon. Don Boudria
Mr. Speaker , it is just that I hesitate to blame you personally for everything that has happened because you share some responsibilities for other members in the Chamber , and I know you recognize that Mr. Speaker .
there are few Canadian politicians , in fact not one that I could name , that have to their credit having won 58 out of 58 seats in a provincial election or any election .
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the comments from my esteemed colleague .
some hon. members :
as you have heard from many other members , you enjoy the confidence of this House and we look forward to having you preside over some of these debates .
conservative PARTY
it exists today .
you have empowered your Speaker to specifically interpret the rules of the House and to give rulings on the rules we have agreed on as an assembly of the House of Commons collectively .
it is not a question of us being ideologically different .
they certainly are my Rock of Gibraltar .
there is no accountability here .
that is one reason I am concerned that this plan is moving in that direction .
KINSMEN CLUB OF ERIN MILLS
let me assure you that the mandate the people of Bourassa have given me is something near and dear to my heart and that I take it very seriously , because I am very much aware of my responsibilities and the trust these people have put in me .
either it was not a priority on his personal political agenda or he was overruled .
this is an agreement which is presently being negotiated in the context of the OECD between Canada and other OECD countries .
hon. Allan Rock
older Canadians have earned the right to a secure retirement .
that begs a question .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
this is an ambitious yet vital agenda since its success will ensure that our youth are prepared for the jobs of the next millennium .
in rising to say a few words in this debate today , I would first like to agree with the Reform Party that we obviously do need a public debate on the direction this country should go in terms of its public finances and spending .
why is that ?
how can they , after that , comment on it ?
bill C - 238 .
the public needs to be consulted and this committee will ensure that the public will be consulted .
that is certainly what this minister of fisheries is doing .
as well , there is always the fear that the committees are viewed as rubber stamps for the government .
this government ' s many cuts , high interest rates , the present high rate of unemployment , and modest incomes have done more damage to the CPP than the aging of the population .
i think it is one of the most fundamental things we must do .
madam Speaker , my constituents in Abitibi know that I stand up for what I believe in .
sadly what happened to him I believe will act as a strong disincentive for government members to defy or even mildly depart from the instructions of their whip .
Mr. Peter Adams
i have a question for my colleague .
Mr. Peter MacKay
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , thank you for the opportunity to provide additional information for your consideration of the question of privilege raised by the member for Wild Rose .
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - Orl 茅 ans , BQ ) :
there is no end of benefits to lowering personal income tax .
in fact the Reform Party plan would put a billion dollars back into the pockets of Atlantic Canadians through tax relief .
out of these elements I would build a nation great among the nations of the world .
we have no quarrel with that .
child poverty is now at such levels in this country , and of such duration , that it threatens to create two tiered citizenship .

Mr. Michel Bellehumeur
request FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
French Canadians are not second class citizens , as the member has just said .
Mr. Ted White :
however for him to say that we need more of the same and indeed much more of it will probably not bring the kind of solutions he is looking for .
put simply , current contribution rates are not sufficient to sustain the current benefit payouts now or in the future .
someday it will voters themselves who will decide how our country is run rather than four or five year dictatorships .
in total , Canadians will live about four and a half years longer in retirement than current retirees .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau
i have heard that .
it refuses to be proactive .
these new provisions are balanced and fair both ways for either exclusions or inclusions .
anyone with an interest in modern history will find a rich and rewarding experience in Ajax and the surrounding area .
Mr. Paul DeVillers
may I even be so bold as to say that this is a bodacious bill .
Ms. Elinor Caplan
that is why one of the first mandates of the government is making youth a priority .
while I do not want to scoop the fiscal update of the Minister of Finance which will be delivered in mid - October , it is no secret that because of the good work of the government and of the Minister of Finance , we are doing a great deal better in 1997 - 98 than had originally been projected .
when the plan came in back in 1966 it had to respond to the realities of the day .
the people who saved for their retirements are now going to find out that these Liberal members are going to take that away from them .
both his father and one of his grandfathers were lieutenant - governors of Nova Scotia and even today , if someone asks an old - timer in Guysborough the way to the Fraser summer place , one will be directed very clearly to what is referred to as the governor ' s house .
he said about the need for a fresh start : " I say that the time has come for gentlemen on the other side to cease their boasting and self - glorification and for the people of the country to open their eyes and see that a new departure must be made from the policy which has been followed for the last 10 years .
the process of consensus - building will engage the private sector partners in an era of co - operation on economic goals .
Mr. John Finlay
in all cases , they have the right to be treated with dignity .
of course we recognize there are problems but unlike the Reform Party , we are not into magic or simple solutions that will go forth and resolve complex problems .
Mr. Peter MacKay
i do know that in Ontario there are members who represent large aboriginal areas .
here is my answer .
forty years ago nine youngsters demonstrated tremendous courage in dealing with segregationist policies which excluded them from attending mainstream schools in Arkansas .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
the debate must be about the right of the province of Quebec , and the country of Quebec , to organize its own school boards , as the National Assembly wishes , and must not be about language rights .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
the Speaker :
Mr. Lorne Nystrom :
these are the same people who are saying this tax hike will not cost jobs .
the House extended the time and did not place a limit on the hon. member ' s time .
i am particularly pleased when we have members opposite who are interested in the science and technology files .
the government will face many challenges in the 36 th Parliament .
Mr. Speaker , when TAGS was created , members will remember the former Minister of Fisheries and Oceans stood in the House to say that only one - third of the expenditure was to go to income support .
they have been told for more than 30 years that we in Quebec want nothing more to do with Canada - wide programs .
i applaud all of those who , like the residents in Fergus , are doing something to support our culture .
my father was in the Dutch resistance during the war of 1939 to 1945 .
they are trained in national and international crimes such as drug trafficking , illegal immigration and terrorist activities , as well as gun running .
i suggest he has to do some work at home to look after some problems that restrict the ability of Canadian businesses to take advantage of the trade deals .
the facts do not lie .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
i do not understand why he is asking such questions today .
Mr. Nelson Riis
the proposed changes by the Liberals are immense and far - reaching and simply cannot be allowed to be rammed through in a hurry .
if the government makes higher spending its number one priority , there will be no surpluses .

Mr. Speaker , I am not sure that Albertans would be too flattered to be classed in with Don Mazankowski as an average Albertan .
suspension of Sitting
he was talking about fiscal realities .
yesterday I shared with you my intention , with your help of course , to make question period a little more brisk , if you will .
let us look at the list of donators .
briefly , the Caisse should not be considered only as an investment fund like any other , like RRSP ' s , for instance , but as an instrument for growth , a lever that is more powerful than anything we have had in this province until now .
we have a real name and a real passport .

it was a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in which , yes , they did refer to an exercise of bad judgment by an official within the Department of Justice ; but they went on to conclude that the exercise of bad judgment should not lead to a stay of proceedings .
Mr. John Cannis
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
surely the Prime Minister has not forgotten when he was in opposition these motions are inclined to provoke debate ?
the plan was put in place so that changes would occur over a seven year period .
university OF TORONTO
agreed .
the Canada pension plan must be fair and equitable to all Canadians .
we have a number of international trade centres across this country , including one in my province , the one in Toronto .
under the terms of the accord those 18 senators would be resurrected as 18 new members of Parliament each for Quebec and Ontario .
thank you , Madam Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and congratulate you on your appointment .
madam Speaker , it is unfortunate that the Standing Orders of the House require the cameras be trained only on the person speaking , because our audience missed a real burlesque show .
the resolution that will create the joint committee does not concern Quebec ' s language rights .
the program reannounced in yesterday ' s throne speech will not make a dent for the 410,000 unemployed youth .
i also believe the Liberals should give thanks for their deficit reduction prediction to the people in Canada ' s poorer provinces who have had to bear the brunt of Liberal offloading because of reduced equalization payments .
the Ontario government is in the process of introducing those same rights for Ontario voters .
i am not the only accountant in the House .
Mr. Brent St. Denis ( Algoma - Manitoulin , Lib . ) :
in 1994 , just after I was elected , I asked a question in the House of the Minister of Human Resources Development about how secure the plan was since we were having to dip into the contingency fund .
in fact , 74 of the 75 members from Quebec were Liberals .
this stench exists because of questions surrounding the relationship of ministers of this government and their departmental information and agents of the Liberal Party of Canada .
in 1993 the finance minister said no government can operate effectively when its projections fall consistently short of the mark .
only you , Mr. Speaker , as guardian of privileges can act in such a manner .
member spoke in Inuktitut . ]
the results of the Angus Reid survey suggest how we may further reform Canada ' s criminal justice system but they also speak to the need to involve citizens in the communities in the development of safe and effective solutions .
Mr. John Finlay ( Oxford , Lib . ) :
i am proud to be the first female in the history of my riding to sit in the House of Commons and even more proud to be of Inuit descent .
what I said this morning , given the serious allegations hanging over the Liberal Party of Canada , over the government , was that it seems to me that there is an urgent need here for legislation similar to that in Quebec so as to ensure that democracy does not have a price tag attached to it , that we do not find ourselves with a system in which financial interests are more important than the expressed wishes of voters , a system in which a court would hand down anti - democratic rulings in Canada , the world ' s greatest country , a system in which money , not democracy , rules the day .
technology partnerships Canada has a $ 250 million investment fund where the federal government and the private sector finance leading edge technologies that fuel job creation and economic growth .
we point out that because of things like interest payments on the debt the federal government has reduced its transfers for health care by 35 percent .
this is very important .
points OF ORDER
Mr. Speaker , as some people spoke to me very highly of this new member , I cannot resist the temptation and ask him two short questions .
resumption of Debate on Address in Reply
some hon. members :
i would like to take the opportunity to publicly thank him for that and to acknowledge the fact that I was well acquainted with his father who was in this House for many years and who showed the same kind of integrity that his words have reflected .
we might also ask whether his department is the clearing house for influence peddling , which can only be explained by the weakness of federal legislation on the funding of political parties .
ways AND MEANS
does he hear Quebeckers when they tell him that their priority is the economy ?
once again , the federal government is acting like a bull in a china shop .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
third , we are attempting to develop specific projects overseas through the work of CIDA to help remove children from hazardous child labour and provide alternative working opportunities for them in company with local NGOs in those areas .
and just as a little aside , he might like to tell us a little later why , having had to run four times to get elected , he does not want to allow Quebeckers to vote a third time on Quebec ' s sovereignty ?
Mr. Paul Szabo
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie ( Louis - H 茅 bert , BQ ) :
what is normal is that an opposition member gets it .
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) :
Mr. Jerry Pickard
i refer to the fact that two bills have been introduced in the Senate by the government and will be considered by the Senate before being considered by the Commons .

Mr. Speaker , the presence of the RCMP at Mirabel and Dorval reflects changes that are going on with regard to those two airports that cannot be duplicated anywhere else in the country .

breast cancer has had a profound effect on my own family .
i as an speaking Canadian was not aware of the significance of the role played by the valley of the forts in the preservation of our nation .
the worst in all this is - and I ask the hon. member for Berthier - Montcalm to comment on this - that it is not surprising to see fundraiser Pierre Gobeil demand cash contributions .
it is the opposition that moved a motion to make sure that there would be no debate .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
the government talks a lot about the new economy but understands little of it .
Mr. Speaker , I know you are a businessman and I know that much of the business you have done in your lifetime has been spending dollars that have come from other people .
a tap on the wrist is insufficient for that type of behaviour .
around the world today people look to Canada because we are an example of a fiscally responsible government and , at the same time , a government caring for those who need the most help in our society .
it stands to reason when payroll taxes are increased small businesses will not be able to hire as many people as they would otherwise want to hire .
this demonstrates what vision and leadership can provide to Canadians and what we need to do to ensure the sustainable growth of the Canadian economy .
the member for Repentigny has the floor .
i congratulate the government on the commitment to deal assertively to bring clarity to this debate .
there is therefore no connection between people ' s religious beliefs and the method of management we will adopt for school boards .
we must reflect seriously on this situation .
Mr. Joe Jordan ( Leeds - Grenville , Lib . ) :
about eight and a half were in favour of increased spending for social programs , and about nine and a half favoured tax relief .
on the same point of privilege , Mr. Speaker .
they want to postpone it for six months .
it is a large and comprehensive bill , and I am sure there may be some very constructive amendments coming forward .
the draft bill no longer provides for an interim bill .
what we promised in the throne speech yesterday was to let Canadians benefit from a study by Statistics Canada , for which my department is responsible .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
on top of that , the premier of the province spent $ 350,000 on a campaign and never advanced one penny to the opponents of the cause .
Mr. Speaker , I listened attentively to the member ' s remarks .

the House met at 10 a.m.
Clair to give young people work experience and a wage while they serve our community .
Mr. Speaker , this passes as more than being an incident .
our caucus has looked carefully at the bill and we are pleased to see that it makes some important concessions based on amendments proposed by the agriculture committee that I referred to earlier .
it would rather perpetuate the doctrine of Pierre Elliott Trudeau , who advocated a dominating and centralizing federal government and would not recognize the identity and aspirations of the people of Quebec .
i will deal with this matter after the question period .
NEWMARKET YOUTH CENTRE
in addition to making them accountable , their presence means the Canadian Wheat Board is more plugged in to what they actually experience .
the Reform Party proposals will enable the government to assume the same attitude toward its responsibilities , as the example of ADM , A 茅 roports de Montr 茅 al , clearly illustrates .
a country as blessed as Canada should be able to somehow find room at the table for the hungry , shelter for the homeless , work for the idle , care for the elderly and infirmed and hope for the destitute .
we certainly face challenges .
under the tutelage of the Reform Party , the Liberal Party of Canada has chosen not to face the issue .
i think we sometimes assume that it is just a matter of fact that we have to have poor children .
the government today had an opportunity to embrace change going into the 21 st century .
the study states that quality of life issues are extremely important in the greater Toronto area and metropolitan Toronto in particular to attracting jobs and growth .
the federal government now operates a $ 30 million a year opportunities fund to this end , but it is my sincere hope that in the years to come more attention and more money will be directed at this often overlooked group of Canadians .
bill C - 4 , the Canadian Wheat Board bill , is a difficult issue .
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
Mr. Ghislain Fournier
i say shame for not giving younger Canadians a voice on this .
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
while the intention may be good , the means used create confusion , unless the words " women '' , " disabled '' , etc. , are added , because it implies that the two parties agree with the Reform Party ' s amendment seeking to reject the idea of a public pension plan for Canadians , including a number of Quebeckers .
this is an idea that is being explored elsewhere .
that having been said , we pledge to work in partnership with the provinces and territory .
in conclusion , I extend my congratulations and best wishes to all who have been elected to the House .
we must continue to pursue excellence on behalf of our country Canada .
agreed .

i will undertake to serve my constituents to the very best of my ability and talent .
more important , they will have the tools and the skills to live useful lives .
with respect to the Canada millennium endowment fund , I understand that access to these funds is not going to be based on merit but on something called need which will be defined by the bureaucrats in whatever way they choose .
even U.S. President Bill Clinton stated he cannot deny the sincerity of the men at the rally .
in this land of plenty , we have hunger .
for example , UI charges repeat claimants the same premiums as someone who works but has never collected .
the other part about the premiums that worries me in terms of regressivity is that year ' s basic exemption which is now about $ 3,500 a year under this bill will stop being indexed .
there were public consultations and they happen every five years .
if it is that hard to make a decision to mail a letter to Quebec , how can Canadians expect him to make the hard decisions required to unite this country ?
Mr. Yvan Loubier
in other words , does he not think that increasing the Canadian government ' s debt load while they were in power added to the pension problem in Canada ?
we need to understand these things .
we see ourselves as having a twofold mandate .
Mr. Speaker , I am very happy to have an opportunity to say a few words on Bill C - 2 , an act to establish the Canada pension plan investment board and to amend the Canada pension plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts .
we are now reviewing the situation to see what can be done under the circumstances that will prevail next year .

the stewardship of the plan will be improved and public accountability will be strengthened .
in his presentation , the hon. member from the New Democratic Party conceded to the fact that the purpose of the amendment was to prevent the bill from proceeding .

Mrs. Diane Ablonczy
while Canadians may take infrastructures for granted , such infrastructures are non - existent on a number of reserves .
Mr. Andrew Telegdi
we in New Brunswick , Newfoundland and Nova Scotia pay more for postage stamps than anywhere else in the country because this government introduced the HST .
this is what the government had to pay out for the bungled Airbus investigation .
we are increasingly an important part of a global village in a global economy .
and this includes improving the employment insurance system , given the deep cuts made over the last five years , particularly in benefits to seasonal workers .
the hon. member for Lac - Saint - Jean .
Mr. Speaker , it is a common practice of separatist leaders in Quebec to describe anyone who is fighting separation as someone who is fighting Quebec .
in August I held job creation focus groups with business people , community leaders and residents in Parkdale - High Park .
this government has been a model in the application of pay equity .
i am not sure .
can the Minister of Health tell Canadians how much of our government health care research funds are going to schizophrenia research ?
this is the same throne speech .
a private supermarket can get thousands of products to thousands of consumers on the very day they need any one of them , but the wheat board cannot get one product to one port in the month the customer wants it let alone the right day .
the government has been blessed by many things , some of them completely beyond its control or which it had nothing whatsoever to do with .

can the minister tell the House how many war criminals her department has currently identified in Canada ?
i would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that long before the Reform Party darkened these halls or lit these halls , depending on one ' s perspective , the NDP and before that the CCF were calling for the abolition of the Senate , precisely because it offended our democratic values and our feeling that whatever institution we have , whether it be no Senate or a new Senate , that it be democratic in nature .
as far as the debt is concerned , we are working with the provinces and the lenders to find solutions that will be adequate as soon as possible to assist the students because we are very concerned about the debt situation right now .
however , a balanced budget law would be an important first step in reassuring Canadians from coast to coast that the painful tax increases and reductions in the social safety net that were made necessary by previous governments will never occur again .

i applaud the federal government ' s commitment to cultural organizations such as the Canadian Publishing Development Corporation and the Canada Council for the Arts , which is celebrating its 40 th anniversary .

they request Parliament to affirm the duty of parents to responsibly raise their children according to their own conscience and beliefs , and to retain section 43 in Canada ' s Criminal Code as it is currently worded .
all those opposed will please say nay .
i will take a moment to describe the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement , in whose likeness , although only partially , the Canada pension plan investment board will be established .
our vision will bring Canadians , ourselves included , face to face with the challenge of being the best in the world .
we Quebecers have known that since the Tremblay report .
i hope we get the opportunity in the very near future to debate these very important and urgent amendments to the Young Offenders Act .
canada is not only a peacekeeper .
increasingly our prosperity is dependent on making the most of our international opportunities .
being a farmer , labour as it relates to me most directly is in the shipment of grain to port .
in this regard I would like to add , Mr. Speaker , that the wheat board has been particularly effective in smoothing out extreme swings in the economic cycle .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
bill C - 2 .
they also make no bones about wanting to get back into manpower training .
what was the situation awaiting us in 1984 when we came to power ?
our member for St. Albert has a weekly waste report .
it does not look at the growth in the economy .
we are going to move to a fuller funding .
however we have information to suggest that there may be others .
how will the minister rid Canada of the 300 modern - day war criminals and the 38,000 illegal refugees harboured in this country ?
Madame Speaker , I am happy to speak today in this House .
it wants to give the provinces the thankless job of making the cuts , and once they are suitably hated and detested by taxpayers , the federal government will ride in as the saviour and say to these taxpayers " The federal government , the best and strongest government , can now give you what the province denied you or deprived you of '' .
is that agreed ?
i am hoping that he finds something in Canada , preferably in New Brunswick so he can continue to work and promote our province .
i would also like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to respond to the Speech from the Throne .
when the member was on the government side for a period of nine years , why did he not ask his government to take action on such an important issue so that the Canada pension plan could be reformed in order to ensure that those who retired in the future would have a pension to rely on to help them carry on with their daily lives ?
the reasons given are overfishing , overestimating stock size , fishing abuses such as high grading and discards , changes in the marine ecosystem and finally , failures of the then political -
it was immediately repealed by the Conservative government because he was right .
we have established a $ 140 million Canadian adaptation and rural development strategy to assist farmers and farm organizations by funding research to develop farming and crop technology .
these polls are no referendum , but let me tell you that , when one is called , Quebecers will speak .
in general foreign trade is very important to Windsor .
* * *
what are the issues ?
they do not know whether they will still be eligible for employment insurance ; fathers , single mothers , young people who have worked hard to get off welfare will find themselves forced back on to it .
the intention of this review is to deal with exactly what the Reform Party asked earlier in the House .
has he not looked at any of the international examples to see that this kind of plan actually can work ?
the Conservative Party has baggage as well .
we should remember that the arts industry ' s sustenance and growth and the commensurate benefit to government revenues and Canadian society can be assisted by the Government of Canada without increasing the federal debt .
Mr. Speaker , like a number of my colleagues I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as deputy chairman of the committees of the whole House .
nor do they boast about the fact that they cut $ 4.5 billion in transfer payments to the provinces , including $ 1.3 billion to Quebec alone .
i want to ask the minister a supplementary question .
so was English Canada ' s paternalism .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye
who will pay for the errors of the past ?
when it comes to the young people of our society , people who we worry a lot about because of their concerns of future employment , this government in the last Parliament , and even more this Parliament , stands ready to make sure that in co - operation with the provinces through an enhanced scholarship program , through initiatives with industry it can make sure that they have a chance at that first job , at starting life on the right foot .
Mr. Ren 茅 Laurin :
yea .
the hon. member for T 茅 miscamingue .
i hope they will ask me for the judgment of Judge Huband to read how accountable the wheat board is .
if we had entered the next century with a debt of $ 700 billion or $ 800 billion , what sort of a future would that provide for our young people ?
this coruscating Bill C - 2 most certainly rises to that challenge .
when there is no inflation , low interest rates and a competitive dollar , we can produce and be very competitive .
my Canada includes Quebec . It is a vibrant , thriving society .
the government blames the railways , the railways blame the wheat board and the farmers pay .
trade
they would love me to stop talking about the people in Atlantic Canada who met our caucus and said they have not worked in four years because of this government ' s policies on free trade , NAFTA and now the multilateral agreement on investment .
he is in Stornoway .
i will look forward to what will happen in the debates to come .
health
he said " But with these thousand crosses planted in Oppenheimer Park today , who really see them , feel sorrow , feel loss , feel rage ?
perhaps the most respectful way a society can acknowledge the contributions of its citizens is in the treatment it accords its seniors .
Mr. John Solomon :
finally , I would like to offer my colleagues in the House these thoughts on national unity .
i may be upset with how things were done in the past , as I said , but fear not , I am looking to the future .
Mr. Randy White
together the federal and provincial governments would set priorities and standards for the management and delivery of health care services .
radar VETERANS REUNION
as I rise today , 17 years later almost to the day , we face an unemployment crisis in Cape Breton of 20 percent minimum .
we found that improvements were necessary .
SAGUENAY AND MANITOBA FLOODS
third , the law should hold agents of the crown directly accountable for the actions or omissions in permitting the release of offenders .
what can and will work to bring this country together is to give Canadians everywhere the feeling that they have a government that cares , a government that will bring about real jobs by reducing taxes , not just floating statistics , a government that will support fair reduced taxes after it has begun a debt reduction program , a government that will make families a priority , a government that will work to make our streets safer by recognizing and correcting the misguided Young Offenders Act , a government that will repair the damage done by the past governments to the all important social safety net and pensions , a government that will view taxpayers for who they are , our employers , not simply as walking wallets .
i claim that we have come to a period in the history of our country when we decide once and for all which shall prevail , profits or human welfare .
under the present government ' s plan , millions of children will still go to school hungry tomorrow .
my question is for the Prime Minister .

that bonus would have kept the Yukon weather forecast station operating for another 10 years .
Mr. Monte Solberg :
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak to this bill to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
this is very important .
the Liberal Party of Quebec won three out of four by - elections in the province .
Mr. Bouchard fought for these very policies , and finally won over his colleagues at the cabinet table .
recently an opportunity has arisen for the purchase and renovation of the Fergus building that houses the Grand Theatre , which a number of theatre groups call home .
that is what it is , another tax .
however let me say that I think Canadians are a balanced people , are pragmatic and believe in balanced approaches .
i will table this copy only after I am done with my speech .
i suggest that is a test that in the final analysis only the Parliament of Canada can apply .
Mr. Ted White :
the challenge is to find ways for all Atlantic Canadians to both contribute to and share in our national bounty .
in 1993 , for half a year , from April 1 to one month after election day , he claimed $ 72,749 in travelling expenses .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :

it gives me an opportunity to enlighten him from a slightly different perspective on his understanding of the Quebec problem .
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wish to table my private member ' s bill entitled the negotiation of terms of separation act .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate the member on his maiden speech .
it is important to look at the origin of this debate .
is that progress ?
the option to eliminate the death benefit was rejected by the federal and provincial governments .
if an investigation is underway , which was confirmed yesterday by the RCMP , we must do everything we can to avoid obstructing the investigation in any way .
Mr. Speaker , I directed my question to the prime minister and I am hoping we are going to get an answer .
as a responsible party we do our part to ensure , to the degree that we can , that we provide some background information so that when people give us feedback on these issues it is informed and that people really understand all the things that have happened in the past .
that money should be invested in the main in this country .
i would like to work with all members of the House of Commons to fix the deep and widening gaps in our society .
our ancestors came here thousands of years ago , lived off the land and adapted to dramatic changes .
Mr. Hec Clouthier
Mr. Speaker , I would like to respond to the hon. member ' s discussion on the issue of resource development .
Mr. Ellis was also one of the founders of the CCF in Saskatchewan in the 1930 s , 1940 s and 1950 s .
i would like to say to him that if the federal government paid its dues , including the $ 2 billion for the harmonization of the GST and the billions of dollars we have been deprived of because of the cuts , not only would we not be short of funds , but we would not be doing any unloading onto the municipalities and the Quebec government would already have a balanced budget , even before you did , a budget that would be a lot stronger than yours .
Ms. Raymonde Folco
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate you on your appointment as one of our deputy speakers and I wish you well .
i want to get to the very heart and soul of this debate by sharing with my colleagues the motion that is before us for discussion this afternoon .
i am honoured to have been able to represent them for almost nine years now and I shall continue to work hard for them .
it is , of course , easy to reduce the deficit by $ 42 billion when the government does so , as I have said , by cutting benefits to the most disadvantaged and to the unemployed , and by such actions as helping itself to $ 5 billion from the employment insurance fund .
Mr. Richard Marceau
bill C - 203 .
i refer you , Mr. Speaker , to Beauchesne ' s sixth edition , citation 11 , which reads " The House is to adjust the interpretation of its precedents and tradition in the light of changing circumstances '' .
it was truly a non - partisan effort that shows what we can do regardless of our political position and philosophy when we come together to work on issues .
some hon. members :
this is an urgent matter .
i am particularly proud to see that young people are providing reinforcements to the sovereignist ranks .
Mr. Speaker , there is an ongoing investigation by the RCMP at this moment .
how can they do that ?

Mr. Reed Elley
pension experts at William Mercer Ltd. estimate that the seniors benefit will raise the average tax bill of a retiree by $ 3,000 to $ 7,000 a year and increase their tax rates .
last year those ripples gathered enormous speed when our Minister of Foreign Affairs issued a challenge to governments around the world to sign , this December in Ottawa , a treaty that unambiguously bans land mines .
when will Canada finally understand that the Constitution , which was drawn up in the last century , no longer meets , if it ever did , the needs we now have and will continue to have in the next century ?
we are pleased there is a balanced budget on the horizon but the Liberals must be held accountable .
we should not forget that the Quebec electoral legislation does not prevent financing activities where some people often pay in excess of a $ 1,000 to sit close to a minister or an MNA they wish to talk to .
you talked about that in the past as a union organizer .
this is exactly what Quebec intends to do .
hon. members across the way know this and in a private moment I think would admit that Canadians out there really do want tax relief .
one way to do that is to offer more support to our local industries .
they will not be members of the Reform Party , but certainly friends of the Liberal r 茅 gime will be sitting on the board .
although the Leader of the Opposition did not refer to what his party is going to propose , undoubtedly it will be a form of dual marketing .
the truth is that this was no economic mission .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
the Quebec National Assembly adopted the resollution unanimously .
today I want to confirm my commitment to working for the deaf .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , after the initial shock , the Minister of Human Resources Development confirmed that he had indeed informed the RCMP of allegations of dubious fundraising practices .
on October 16 , 1989 Albertans elected the late Stan Waters to the Senate .
i would certainly agree with her .
and the source of funding ?
the government House leader and all members know that it is standard procedure for the opposition , and maybe another opposition party or two , to move amendments and subamendments on important bills .
unfortunately , due to the response and the patent answers that we are receiving from the government , the issue has now expanded and goes far beyond the boundaries of the province of Quebec and I would suggest far beyond the boundaries of only the Liberal Party of Canada .
search and rescue is of paramount importance to thousands of Canadians from those who make their living in the remote regions of the country , be it at sea , on land or in the air , to the many Canadians who simply enjoy boating , camping , fishing and the great outdoors .
the whole process was kept as obscure as possible so they could reward their political friends .

however , the committee gives them responsibility for producing a critical mass of French content for francophones outside Quebec .
they are knowledgeable , passionate and have high expectations of their member of Parliament .

i would also like to thank the Prime Minister , who honoured me by asking me to move the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne .
this is regrettable , but I am deeply convinced that in the end the Canadian people , whom I sincerely trust , will not allow it .
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
while we have 9 percent unemployment , our largest trading partner , the United States , has an unemployment rate of almost half that .
Mr. Greg Thompson :
part of the government ' s strategy is to bring forward the bill for 180 minutes of debate with 10 minute speeches and no questions and comments .
i can tell the minister , man to man , that it does not .
if the government wanted to do something today it could reduce premiums 25 per cent .
am I going to have to stand up here and fight against that ?
i was fortunate to be given the opportunity to make my debut appearance earlier last week during question period .
in such a case the request would first have to come from a recognized commodity group and the board of directors would have to recommend the inclusion .
the Speaker :
is that agreed ?
hon. Jean J . Charest
i would ask all hon. members and people viewing this debate to answer this question .
i am not a policeman so I do not know how long it takes police agencies to investigate this kind of an issue .
Mr. Jim Gouk
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
i hope we make the necessary distinctions between denominational and linguistic rights .
canada has negotiated better trade agreements outside our country than it has been able to negotiate inside Canada .
i will say that he is right about the Sydney tar ponds issue .
madam Speaker , I listened to the speech of the hon. member for St. John ' s East and I must say with a great deal less approbation than has been expressed by the hon. member for Elk Island .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans .
as this is my maiden speech I would like to take the opportunity to let my constituents know I am truly honoured to be in the House of Commons representing them as the newly elected member of Parliament for Edmonton East .
i am very pleased that the government has made this commitment .
they have just disappeared .
Mr. Speaker , it is very simple .
i was frustrated too .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
the way they will exercise those powers will depend on the will of their respective population .

routine PROCEEDINGS
the final report of the committee , entitled " Review of section 14 of the Patent Act amendment , 1992 " was reported to the House of Commons only on April 23 , 1997 , five days later .
he took all the money out of the Tobique - Mactaquac area and put it into the riding of his previous minister , who is still in this government .
i imagine my hon. colleague denies Quebec ' s right to separate .
that is why Canadians returned their confidence on June 2 by electing a Liberal government to lead them into the 21 st century .
the public opinion polls in Chile show overwhelming support for the self - funding pension plan established in that country .
the reality however is that the most pervasive tax , the tax on jobs , has less to do with being prudent and more to do with eliminating the deficit by taxing jobs directly .
it is as a result of the fact that this government has been successful in reducing the deficit and gaining a handle on the fiscal management of this country .
this just about brings to a close the question and comment period .
yet when this government passed Bill C - 110 in the last Parliament and handed out vetoes it recognized five regions .

it came to my attention yesterday afternoon that the office and position of legislative counsel has in a de facto manner ceased to exist .
i would like to hear what he has to say about this , whether there is not a way to get the New Democrats to change their position so that they can lead the way in Canada for what could become a good partnership between Quebec and Canada , between two sovereign states .
so many of us here , inspired by his work and by his commitment to such things , intend to continue that work and to defend and to promote the ideals that he represented in this place .
we have been united in the need and the cause for accountability and transparency collectively in the use of management funds .
i had been convinced by these people that it was in the greater public good for us to vote for Meech Lake .

the Speaker :
when it is all added up , a 10:1 ratio in favour of the CPP makes a lot more sense .
my suggestion is that this is simply not enough .
unfortunately , that is the sad reality .

on the one hand , the Liberals praise the merits of Canada , while on the other hand , they are trying to deny one of the most fundamental principles of democracy : the right to decide .
they no longer want to see government reacting .
Ms. Beth Phinney ( Hamilton Mountain , Lib . ) :
the government should stop favouring millionaires and billionaires , and turn instead to small and medium businesses , which are the ones creating jobs .
how can the minister justify a throne speech that contains nothing at all for the unemployed and for seasonal workers , when he knows that the unemployment insurance fund will again this year produce a surplus of at least $ 7 billion ?
are these people even going to get to read this sort of study ?
* * *
one has to speculate the point of consultations , submissions and hearings undertaken by the minister and his government over the the past year if in the final analysis they do not intend to listen to and incorporate those ideas .
i do not think we need to make constitutional changes to make that work .
i want him to make sure that he will stand in this House and champion that part of tax reform .
i would like to congratulate the Prime Minister on behalf of all our children and on behalf of my daughters .
you could not think of a way to hinder economic recovery better than that .
Mr. Speaker , if we agree or not it is important to be able to hear what the hon. member is saying .

in my view the government House leader has partially misinformed parliament .
the use or the threat of the use of force as a solver of international problems has increasingly yielded to peaceful modes of dispute settlement that rely heavily on friendly co - operation and reciprocity and mutual advantage .
the answer to that question is yes , there is a problem .
now he has interfered in my area .
for example , what contribution would the employers have to pay , if any ?

Mr. Yvan Loubier :
Mr. Speaker , fundamental to the Speech from the Throne is the underpinning that we have to build strategies and programs that are reflective of our fiscal means and which accommodate our resources .
clearly our parties disagree on the function of the retirement system .
these misunderstandings go as far back as 1867 .
it was an honour for me to win the election and to voice their concerns on the floor of the House of Commons .
we pledged to invest in measures to help Canadians respond to the expanding need for home care and community care and to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services and delivery .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to comment on the speech by the hon. member for Rimouski - Mitis .
the fourth pillar we propose is broad based tax relief such as proposed in our 1997 federal election fresh start platform .
some of the people in my riding are never heard by those in power .
but we in the Bloc Quebecois are going to tell it all .
they are saying the institution is out of control and ready to blow .
to say that we have been betrayed is perhaps the truth .
the LATE MR. J . CHESTER MACRAE
legislation speaks for itself clause by clause .
i also thank those who are my constituents for the first time .
as unbelievable as this is , Mr. Amerasinghe clearly and accurately describes the story being put forward by the justice department as false and a cover up , and this assessment is not denied by any justice official in the documents filed with the Supreme Court of Canada .
the 600,000 people outside Quebec who still speak French need a party to represent them and not one that kowtows to the majority .
Paul Martin had the foresight to take the issue on immediately -
the government ' s own departments have drawn concern to this .
i thought I had made a mistake because I did not see an iota of real substance about natural resources .
Mr. Ellis ' interest in politics started very early in life .
Mr. Speaker , the recommendations of the panel are being very carefully reviewed by the federal government in preparing its response to the proponent .
we hope he is sincere in his extending a hand for some advice .
an investigation is underway , and the Bloc is busy sullying the reputation of people who have not yet had a chance to defend themselves .
and we have the plight of our aboriginal brothers and sisters being ignored as they attempt to heal and rebuild their communities through self - determination and self - government .
would he be agreeable to the Liberals and the Bloc Quebecois joining forces to look at what is being done in Quebec in order to improve finances at the present time , not just government finances , but also those of the political parties ?
Mr. Speaker , I would like to know if the New Democratic Party agrees that this government should send a team Canada group into the Atlantic region so that there will be a better understanding of the needs of our people in the Atlantic region , and find a way to create the jobs for all those mature people who are out of work , the moms and dads who want to work , who want to feed their families and pay for the education of their children and get back their dignity .

Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) :
Clair , Lib . ) :
that this House condemn the government for making their 50 / 50 election promise on any future surpluses without adequate public debate as to the optimal size of government , taxes , and debt , thus threatening to repeat Canada ' s 27 year old history of irresponsible spending , creating high debt , financed by high taxes , causing high unemployment .
these programs go a long way in helping our youth reach their potential and making them responsible citizens in their communities .
i would like to know if the hon. member could disclose to me what the people in her riding are saying regarding the merging of the GST and the PST .
the government really should be setting targets to reduce the debt to GDP ratio .
is the government House leader actually saying you can do anything you like in the dying days of a Parliament because once the election is called there is no more privilege , there are no more rules and it is perfectly okay for a committee to vet its report with the government minister ?
we will and our country ' s finances are currently in the best position in decades .
we will have to , as will people from all parts of Canada and members on all sides of the House , work to ensure that the kind of unemployment which we have now is brought down to an effective and appropriate level .
Mr. Speaker , if we reduce taxes we are not reducing the deficit .
i listened to members of the NDP who constantly think the simple answer to all our social problems is to spend more money .
Mr. Speaker , I might ask unanimous consent to make my concluding comments .
we have this problem over and over .
i would like to thank the people in Kent - Essex for their support and I look forward to working on their behalf in the House over the next few years .
i will reserve judgment on the Reform amendment but on the face of it I do not see why the amendment is necessary .
i appeal specifically to members from Quebec in this House who , over and above their mandate , are citizens who must believe in respecting democracy and above all in the existence of the people of Quebec .
Mr. Dick Proctor
Canadians should be assured that the best interests of all Canadians in all regions are being taken care of as we move forward to renew the Canada pension plan system .
the government will be initiating measures similar to those suggested by the people of Simcoe North .
the Bloc ' s own true leader , Lucien Bouchard , ran under the Conservative banner .
when will the Prime Minister show some leadership , start to live up to his campaign commitment and tell his finance minister to stop killing jobs ?
we have the brain drain of Atlantic Canada .
having served in a provincial legislature for a number of years , I can say that coming to the House of Commons in this 36 th Parliament is certainly a very special feeling .
to pass this kind of constitutional amendment twice in one year will send a very bad signal to other minority groups throughout the country .
somehow there is the implication that the super RRSP would not be a cost to the Canadian taxpayer .
i think it important to point out that there have been many shortcomings in how the plan ' s money has been built up in the 20 years it has been around and that we thought the present bill needed to be improved in this regard .
it happened twice in my case .
it has added $ 100 billion of debt and called it responsible fiscal management .
Mr. Dick Harris :
it is not even about irresponsible spending .
will the justice minister allow elected members of Parliament to ratify this new supreme court justice or will she simply consult her backroom dealmakers and continue to leave the Canadian people out of the process ?
we have come a long way as a united country .
to do contrary would be very irresponsible .
these things have to be looked at in a global perspective .
in order to fulfil their parliamentary duties , members should of course have access to the information they require .
he did not realize that it was a six day journey from Halifax to Vancouver by train .
more than half of the people said no to that member .
right now there is a risk management system that has been in place and is supported by all courier companies .
my question is for the President of the Treasury Board .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
Mr. Speaker , the papers are quoting opinion polls in Quebec in which Quebeckers were asked their opinion on the premiers ' declaration from Calgary .
i await an answer from our colleague , the member for Durham .
let us look at some of the expenditures coming from the pails of the tax trough , which I used in the last Parliament as well .
this is the kind of success story that comes through the co - operation and partnership of business and government to the benefit of the communities involved .
almost half of all Quebecers voted yes , but did so based on a misunderstanding .
i have come to the House of Commons with the support of my constituents .
there is an underlying concern , and the minister himself has referred to this as the secularization of the school system in Quebec .
young Canadians can go to the best schools in the world , but too many drop out and too many do not find work .
some members opposite could live to be 75 or 80 years of age , although some of them already look like they are octogenarians .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
the government tossed out band - aids , candies and bromides , but it got a bad case of inaction when it came to repairing the structural problems .
it is a shame that in this Parliament we are running roughshod over those very strong principles .
everything has been done above board and according to the rules and regulations of -
we will continue to reduce the employment insurance tax whenever we have the opportunity and the fiscal responsibility to do so .
but Reformers are also pragmatists .
Mr. John Duncan
Mr. Speaker , first I wish to congratulate you on your appointment .
the bill provides for the income tax deduction of the interest paid by a taxpayer on the first $ 100,000 on a mortgage loan secured by the first qualifying home acquired by the taxpayer .
doing so will do more to create jobs and exports in the country than hundreds of team Canada trade missions .
the surprise announcement of this generous gift came at a dinner last night honouring six Nobel laureates from around the world , including our own John Polanyi of the University of Toronto .
the auditor general has just confirmed that the contribution rate for employment insurance was just pulled out of a hat , and is a matter of pure chance .
it is therefore his duty to distribute them equitably .
taxes in Canada now account for almost 40 percent of GDP .
Ms. Wendy Lill ( Dartmouth , NDP ) :
during this second mandate , we will continue to reflect and meet the demands of every province and region .
i was told by many that to fail to continue along the road to debt reduction following the elimination of the deficit would be very erroneous indeed .
Mr. Speaker , Dennis Coffey , a veteran customs inspector , has alleged that the former head of customs at Pearson airport cut secret deals with certain trucking firms to bypass customs clearance .
when you are facing in your riding a party like the Liberal Party of Canada , I can tell you that respect sometimes goes out the window .
the investigation is ongoing independently by the RCMP as it should be .
if the hon. minister in charge of the wheat board had to face farmers in an election today , he would not get elected .
hopefully this example of partnership will provide a template for which other sectors can soon follow .
i brought along with me to the meeting citizens of the Stony reserve .
shame , shame .
the parties involved would agree on who their arbitrator was .
the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement will become the most important and powerful financial instrument ever in Quebec .
the transition from the old Strathcona coffee guru to parliamentarian is no small adjustment .
we have built that nation and we continue to shape its elements .
therefore under the new bill the Canadian Wheat Board would become a mixed enterprise , and for the first time in its lengthy history it would become accountable in a very direct way to the producers it serves .
hon. David M. Collenette
hon. Andy Scott
the leader of the Conservative Party did not articulate exactly what taxes he was talking about and how much .
i declare the motion carried .
i understand where the hon. member is coming from .
some hon. members :
it is time for this government to live up to the words of the throne speech and to keep the only northern forecast station in the north .
in some cases people do become dependent on unemployment insurance .
Mr. Speaker , as the Solicitor General says , RCMP investigations are not the responsibility of political authorities .
that during the period ending December 10 , 1997 , the member proposing a motion on an allotted day shall not speak for more than 20 minutes , following which a period not exceeding 10 minutes shall be made available , if required , to allow members to ask questions and comment briefly on matters relevant to the speech and to allow responses thereto ; and
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and other acts .
i understand their dilemma .
however , if they get their kicks by measuring the orthodoxy of every word , by all means , let them make a study of semantics .
he suggested there should be absolutely no change .
one scenario was that we increase the contributions to the Canada pension plan .
we have entered into an agreement with the provincial governments , including the Government of Quebec .
my Chinese grandfather came to Canada to help build the railway in the late 1800 s .
the city of Barrie is an exciting phenomena of explosive growth , combined with a superb geographical location that affords its citizens an enviable quality of life .
Mr. Werner Schmidt :
at present a person needs to make as little as two CPP contributions during the course of the three years prior to applying and qualifying for disability benefits .
we are a generous and a hard working people .
we wish to have a treaty with the Americans which guarantees proper management of west coast fish stocks , whether they be in Canadian rivers or in others .
yes , 9.9 percent is a real cost and no one denies it .
yeas
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) :
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
a vast majority of the people , at least a clear majority of the people in the province of Quebec , has recently stated they are tired of this issue .
i am confident a reasonable person would reach the same shocking conclusions .
these are the questions we are asking .
the Bloc Quebecois is strongly in favour of responsibility for youth employment programs being returned to Quebec and will do everything in its power to bring this about .
i was very pleased to see that the prime minister picked up on certain themes and ideas and wrote those into the Speech from the Throne .
that would bring to a close our question period for today .
canada has played a pivotal role in the resolve to eliminate global stocks of landmines .
a new investment policy is necessary to get the best return possible in the interests of contributors .
in that context I would like to say how much we in the NDP regret that the government has fouled that good start by moving to closure on a major national policy issue after only one day of debate .
i think the prime minister is right on when he said that the new Parliament and the Speech from the Throne , even though it did not express it very well , but he expressed it so much better , should be about the future generation , the new generation of Canadians , Canada ' s young people .
there is an old expression that says " Don ' t look back unless that is where you want to go '' .
Mr. Speaker , I too would like to congratulate the new member for Nunavut on her maiden speech in the House of Commons .
it has been established by repeated government studies that payouts lagged behind the contributions .
i would remind hon. members to please address each other through the Chair .
canada PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
at least 74 of them voted for that package .
with the greatest respect , hon. members , it is not just the word , it is the context of the word and whether the word is directed to an individual .
bill C - 2 will establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board which will allow the invested funds to be put to uses that typically most pension funds have the capacity to invest in .
where do we have to spend the money ?
that is a full 9 percent lower than it was just a decade ago .
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
asbestos INDUSTRY
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order 81 , I move :
i want to emphasize that we have not developed these proposed changes in isolation .
i know all parliamentarians will join me in underlining the singular contribution made to Canada ' s effort by the late Diana , Princess of Wales .
routine PROCEEDINGS
the international body that looks after all travel documents is the ICAO organization which is situated in Montreal .
Mr. Crouse emphasized in his reply the close economic connection the riding has with the New England states .
how can government , from the solicitor general to D division in Winnipeg , lose the documentation ?
they talked about having the opportunity for a first job , about having the ability to get an education and about having the ability to afford an education .
one must ask why the CBC and the wheat board should be exempt from access to information .
otherwise Canadians will also be greatly disappointed .
that money will be plucked out of that one small local economy .
he was well known as a dedicated member of Parliament who served his constituents very well .
these instruments will now make it possible to develop a badly needed general economic policy .
i do not want to go into a debate on this issue .
now the Liberal government is realizing that it cut too much and too quickly .
in my opinion , Canadians are interested in their day to day needs - jobs , health care , housing - and not in constitutional disputes between parties and governments .
i am here to see to it that a question is properly put and that the minister , the government or the person to whom it is directed has a chance to answer .
the CPP increase represents a tax hike , to put it in other terms , of $ 400 million in 1997 , $ 900 million in 1998 , $ 1.8 billion in 1999 , $ 5 billion in 2001 , and as much as $ 10 billion by the year 2005 , all in constant 1997 dollars .
i want to save myself some running round .
the Speaker :
i think we have a problem here .
some hon. members :
but the federal government is still refusing to listen to reason and to consider any amount at all in this connection .
Canadians recognize that good health depends on much more than medical care .
i am glad that the member does actually recognize the benefit of the Canada child tax benefit .
it is the same thing with corporate tax .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Robert D . Nault ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , until the member ' s last statement I thought he was asking for some way in which we could have uniform programs across the country that would address the needs of young people .
the basic features remain the same today as they were before .
members who are here for the first time will find it a very challenging yet a very productive place if they approach it properly .
any measure that strengthens the country will have a unifying effect on Canada .
we as Canadians owe a great deal to the men and women of the Royal Canadian Legion who in many cases have devoted their lives to the remembrance of their fallen comrades as well as those who have made major sacrifices for the defence of our country .
i would like to ask her a question about what has been said in the House .
this turnaround of the country ' s financial situation is the doing of Canadians all the way from Saint John ' s to Victoria , who rolled up their sleeves to regain their freedom to choose , which had been threatened by increasingly higher deficits .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of the Environment .
no single sector of society nor any one level of government has all the answers .
i have listened attentively to the throne speech , the Prime Minister ' s address and those by the four leaders of the opposition parties .
i believe it is contrary to the Standing Orders of this House to comment in this way about a Canadian court , and especially about Justices of the Supreme Court .
it is a system whereby Canadians are redistributing their wealth .
introduction and first reading
at his retirement he was made an honorary member , officer of the House , with a seat at the table before us .
crown LIABILITY AND PROCEEDINGS ACT
Mr. Speaker , yes , it does happen , in an emergency or for security reasons , that we award what is called sole source contracts .
i draw the attention of hon. members to the fact that pursuant to the standing orders , we will begin with the list of candidates , but first with the list of members who have withdrawn or who are ineligible as candidates .
my dear colleague , you must always address the Chair .
it is something that the Chair should take very seriously .
the agreement on internal trade , which was signed nearly three years ago , was a start .
this note appointed the member as their financial advisor .
i hope all the hon. members of this House will continue working with us for their own constituents and for all Canadians to ensure that our society remains not only one of the most prosperous in the world , but also one of the most progressive , most generous and most responsive to the needs of all its members , and the most vulnerable in particular .
it does mention investing in knowledge and creativity .
these changes are allowing individuals and businesses to operate across borders , around the world , at the speed of light : sharing knowledge , trading in goods , services and capital 24 hours a days , 7 days a week .

some past solutions have worked .
Mr. Ted White :
my goodness , that is quite a question .
Mr. Eug 猫 ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) :
he was one of the ornaments of the House of Commons in this and in previous generations .
fisheries
Mr. Speaker , does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs realize that the only Quebec federalists who still hold any hope for the Calgary declaration are those who think that " unique character " means the same thing as " distinct society " and that it will be in the Constitution , exactly the opposite of the message delivered by the Leader of the Opposition on the weekend to the rest of Canada ?
in contrast to the proposal , we believe that the board of directors should have the authority to choose the president and chief executive officer and we urge the minister to make this amendment .
when we cut through all the red tape and all those provisions , what does it say ?
the word spending has been going around and around this room the past two or three days .
another concern raised by some is that without religion in the schools there is nobody to teach and instil values in Canada ' s young people .
Mrs. Rose - Marie Ur ( Lambton - Kent - Middlesex , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in 1985 , the current Prime Minister said in this House that any innuendo or any suggestion of irregularities would undermine the confidence of Canadians and that it would be better if the suspect were to hand in his resignation .
he was told by the Canadian embassy in Jordan to stay indoors for his own safety .
single desk selling also enables the Canadian Wheat Board to take a unique approach to market development .
he stated repeatedly that he had consulted and that he had the support of Canadians .
i would also ask that you seek the consent of the House to make your election unanimous .
the new chief of defence staff stated that he wants more openness and he immediately put the boot to the military top ranks .
someday all Canadians will truly be equal when there are no more special deals for categories , groups and insiders .
Ms. Alexa McDonough
by investing in the national child benefit , Canadians are sharing the responsibility to get our children off to a good start in life .
Mr. Speaker , this is my first opportunity to speak as the first member of Parliament for the new federal riding of Ottawa West - Nepean .
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) :
hon. Don Boudria :
over 275 businesses are located in the industrial zoned areas .
we do not want to pit seniors against youth and women against men or social groups who want all kinds of benefits which they feel they are entitled to .
as the demographics of the country change it is important for us to accept that we are asking a smaller group of Canadians to carry a heavier burden than ever before with respect to retirement policies .
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
to me democracy is a clear vote with no argument .
we want choice for the grain companies .
it is well served by major highways such as the Queen Elizabeth Way , Highway 427 and Highway 401 .
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) :
the role of the Canadian Wheat Board is to sell western Canadian wheat and barley in the international marketplace at the very best possible price .
this bill is a step in returning Canada back to its vision regarding immigrants .
it is just one extra roadblock on the way to recovery .
i am absolutely convinced , because I think I know the prime minister very well , that if this investigation leads to some serious allegations by the police and if someone is found guilty there will be things done to correct the system .
on the subject of herbal remedies , there is somewhat of an inconsistency in the hon. member ' s position .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien
i rise to make a comment on the hon. member ' s speech .
Mr. Speaker , in terms of grain transportation we have been preoccupied with the fast movement of grain since we came into office .
again , it directs punishment to innocent , law abiding people while ignoring to a large extent the criminal users of firearms .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate the minister on his remarks .
Mr. Darrel Stinson
if they truly do , it is time for them to come to grips with the problem of the debt , with the problem of taxes .
why is it then that , for one reason or another , today , only lip service is paid to Quebec as a people or a nation , particularly on that side of the House ?
then we hear that the government is contemplating buying helicopters , the self - same helicopters it chastised the Conservatives for wanting to buy .
Canadians know the government has wasted an obscene amount of their money to delay the purchase of helicopters that Canada needs .
i would like to give the House some examples .
we in Quebec believe this is not enough .
the Bank of Canada , the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund , and virtually every credible economic think tank in Canada will confirm that payroll taxes kill jobs .
you have obviously prejudged it .
canola is currently not covered by the Canadian Wheat Board .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Robert Marleau , Esquire , Clerk of the House of Commons , read to the House a letter from the Administrative Secretary to the Governor General informing him that the Right Honourable Antonio Lamer , in his capacity as Deputy Governor General , would proceed to the Senate chamber to open the first session of the 36 th Parliament of Canada on Monday , September 22 at Ottawa .

i commended the hon. member from Quebec on his good attendance and good work in committee .
was not New Quebec in his riding a year before , in 1992 ?
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
the Speaker :
his hands will be completely tied because of the Liberal agenda , a Liberal agenda which has been pushed and controlled by the Reformers .
Mr. Speaker , there are 29 proposals in the throne speech for higher spending and nothing on debt reduction or tax reduction .
progress must be made a step at a time , with healthy programs .
we Canadians , in pursuit of national unity , have been like a family packed into the family car trying to get to a destination called united Canada .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal
the present government is increasingly concerned with other people ' s business , and less and less with its own .

Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
it continues to receive just one - ninth of the funding of breast cancer research and one - fiftieth of the research money given to AIDS .
building up a larger fund , fuller funding , and earning a higher rate of return through investment in the market will help pay for the rapidly growing cost that will occur once baby boomers begin to retire .
at the very least we would want the legislation to be quite specific as to when the board could resort to cash buying .
it will be my endeavour to work with as many members in this House and companies and communities across this country in assistance to the Minister of Industry to make sure that we are continuing on the right track to help us grow as a country .
first and foremost they are Canadians and Quebeckers .
what the hon. member should understand is who is suffering today because of deficit reduction .
if the Liberals had had their way we would have had a negotiated agreement - done , finished , fait accompli - by April 1997 and they would never have even let us know it was happening .
our figures show that two - thirds of them will find a job within one year of leaving the program , usually with the employer they interned with .
today is the first day of an intense and important time of year for thousands of our fellow citizens .
we heard the Speech from the Throne on last Tuesday .

someone who has done his duty and called in the police is now being told that this is the behaviour of a boy scout .
Tuesday ' s speech from the throne contained at least one piece of good news .

Mr. R 茅 jean Lefebvre ( Champlain , BQ ) :
however , when we look at the other side of the argument of creating robust capital markets in Canada , we are creating jobs .
this Canadian initiative has evolved from a bold idea to be the focus of a large and growing international consensus that will culminate in the signing of an international treaty in Ottawa in December of this year .

there may have been loans against a line of credit , but that is not a donation .
the minister has not made even half the effort demanded of those who are ill , of students , of the most vulnerable members of society , especially welfare recipients , or of those who would normally re - qualify for employment insurance , but , because of the new employment insurance policy introduced last January , find themselves back on welfare .

as members of Confederation we have in the past prospered when Canada prospered and we have contributed to the prosperity of Canada .
the hon. member knows that and I invite him to address his remarks to the Chair .
others have said in the course of comments during question period that somehow the amendments that were moved by the opposition were an attempt to close off debate .
the government has in place a comprehensive , consultative process and is committed to ensuring the opportunity for full public discussion on the proposed MAI .
our health care system is often considered as one of the key identifying characteristics of what it means to be Canadian .
members will recall the Pearson era , when Quebeckers were allowed to create the Quebec pension lan , and even to make original contributions , such as the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement du Qu 茅 bec , an idea which the government has picked up on in the new bill before us today .
i guess the government does not think it is important enough to allow parliamentarians to debate this issue .
i have received notice of a question of privilege from the hon. member for Wild Rose .

i consider myself a Quebecer , and I am one , although not Quebec - born .
they have launched a court action but they are quite willing to forgo court action if the government will agree to work together with them in partnership to have an independent legal review of their land claim .
they want the federal government to continue to exercise leadership to ensure Canada remains a strong and united country .
the vote stands deferred until the end of Government Orders tomorrow .
i bring this to your attention at this time , not as a matter of ministerial responsibility and not as a matter of debate , but as a matter of our procedures and practices which only you , Mr. Speaker , can entertain under the guise of privilege .
Mr. Speaker , I have a question for the hon. member .
for his service he was awarded the Military Cross .

Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr 芒 ce - Lachine , Lib . ) :
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
is it not the case that the privatization and deregulation and off - loading and cutback policies of this government are contributing to hardship and pain and suffering and greater inequalities facing women in our society today ?
last week the prime minister announced the additional $ 1 billion for a millennium scholarship fund to help young Canadians prepare to take their place in continuing to shape the greatness of this land .

the hon. member contends that in the last Parliament a preliminary draft report of the Standing Committee on Industry was divulged .
i am talking about the employers and the employees of the country who have contributed significantly to the reduction of the deficit through employment insurance overpayments .
some hon. members :
again I will offer some advice to my colleague .
we made a commitment in the election campaign and we will keep that commitment .
at my meeting tomorrow with my provincial counterparts , hopefully we will bring this agenda forward .
the Liberals are obviously inspired by this ideology .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
the member for Sainte - Hyacinthe - Bagot has the floor .
with annual revenues of more than $ 5.8 billion , the Canadian Wheat Board is one of the country ' s largest exporters and one of the world ' s largest grain trading organizations .
as the hon. member is fully aware , there have been great changes in the Canadian economy and with change also comes change to programs and institutions as they too must reflect the changing dynamics of our economy .
i know he will bear that in mind .
we can try to grow revenue , and that is what this government is relying on , growing revenue .
the Canada pension trust needs to be completely independent from the government of the day if it is to work .

we want to encourage the government to consult broadly on any constitutional initiative .
that $ 40 billion is , in large part , lent to the provinces at interest rates that are lower than they can achieve elsewhere for infrastructure , such as the building of schools , hospitals and universities .

whereas the Government intends to institute linguistic school boards as soon as possible :
i would like to congratulate all of last night ' s winners and nominees and make particular mention of two of my constituents .
i am sure that we can all agree with this .
the Liberal government is failing to grapple successfully with at least three emerging realities .
there is no one group that has been singled out or forced to shoulder an undue burden .
beyond the walls of this Parliament , beyond partisanship , beyond the rhetoric , there are a lot of good things to speak about in this country .
the Speaker :
they have in fact increased Doug ' s dependence on his family ' s care and support .
he would increase the pension plan and contributions to the plan but at the same time he must give tax breaks in other forms .
can the member for Saint - Maurice tell us how a grant came to be given to a hotel chain out of the employment insurance fund , to which Canadian workers and business contribute ?
we are going to go to tributes .
what we have today is 1.4 million Canadians out of work .
some hon. members :
i had a number of rather salutary experiences this summer which made me aware of that .
perhaps he only has ears for his own rhetoric , but I have a higher regard for Canadian voters .
we have to do it in a responsible way and we have to put the books of the nation in order .
Mr. Jason Kenney
it is clearly understood by everyone that the section 43 amending formula can be used to amend the Constitution of Canada in order to place further restrictions on any individual provincial government ' s freedom of action .
supreme COURT
when certain groups are shown to be more vulnerable than others , society has a responsibility to lend a helping hand .
i fin it shameful for the government to come and boast in this House about working for the unemployed , for youth , for our students who are looking for work and training in their field .
to be clear , I want to ask the Prime Minister one simple , straightforward question .
let us look at what the Liberals have done right .
that bill had to do with restricting the rights of the accused in obtaining records from therapists in sexual assault trials .
the Speaker :
the Liberals are incapable of honouring their commitments , and I still wonder just what gives the Minister of Finance cause to boast ?
there were Quebecers who were against it , who were part of the PQ government at the time and others .
statistics Canada said that the biggest cause of debt in this country was high interest rates .
there is a lot of stuff that does not make sense in that speech .
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) :
that means the prime minister must have known about the $ 600,000 grant proposal by Videon .
it was a Liberal government that introduced the Canada pension plan over 30 years ago in 1966 , and now this Liberal government is making the necessary changes to ensure the future of the Canada pension plan for all Canadians .
hon. Don Boudria
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
when I was at a meeting yesterday with the government House leader , other House leaders and whips , they asked us how many more speakers we had and we said about five .
the Speaker
Mr. John Bryden
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
like CSIS this organization is highly secretive , ultra secret .
i would hope , in terms of the eventual outcome , as it goes to committee we can look at the many suggestions that are being made to the House today , that we will eventually come up with a good system by which all Canadians can participate and by which all of us , in terms of being members of this Parliament , can ensure that Canadians are guaranteed a safe and secure pension plan that will apply to all workers in the country .
what good is a government code of conduct that nobody knows anything about and that has no appropriate provision for this type of situation ?
i can quote another poem called The Road Not Taken .
Canadians can be sure that we will fight to preserve a public pension system to stop the erosion of security for seniors in their old age .
we have youth unemployment and under employment .
Mr. Speaker , over the past several years youth in particular have been made to bear the brunt of the needlessly high level of unemployment imposed on this country by the Liberal government .
as we have identified the priorities of Canadians , we know indeed that what they want is to be able to continue to live in what is one of the greatest countries in the world , to find ways and means of increasing the democracy that has become renowned around the world .
as a result of the program the municipalities in my riding were able to complete infrastructure programs that would not have been possible without the assistance of federal and provincial governments .
he might have some wisdom to share with the House .
my question is for the Minister of Finance .
it is an interesting place .
time and time again when a member who sits on the government side truly tries to represent the best interests and the wishes of his or her constituents , if those interests run contrary to the position of the government or that of the cabinet and the prime minister , what happens ?
will he confirm that his party has buried the concept of distinct society once and for all and replaced it with the concept of " unique character '' ?
Mr. Speaker , first of all , the members of the panel are appointed by the industry .
Mr. Speaker , as the minister pointed out yesterday , immediately upon receiving the information regarding these allegations , he brought it to the attention of the RCMP .
yes , we are going to reduce the deficit and debt , but at the same time we are not going to forget the opportunities and challenges facing our people .
we want it to proceed but we want it to proceed with the amendments the industry is demanding .
Mr. Peter Goldring ( Edmonton East , Ref. ) :
access TO INFORMATION ACT
Mr. Jack Ramsay
in the fourth section we talk about the optimal level of taxes .
when asked to have a judicial inquiry into the current and past practices of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans , his response was that an inquiry would be a waste of time and money .
they expect us to be innovative and to find and build partnerships .
how does secession square with democracy ?
does he condemn our program to help provide entry level jobs for young Canadians through our public sector internship program ?
if I had time , I would go through the list of the irregularities the Liberals have done during the 35 th Parliament .
bill C - 2 .
they know very well with the government members , five of them being appointed , all they have to do is take three members away from the 10 and they have the majority .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
the member for Kelowna today wanted more of a public debate on where this surplus should go .
there is not a tax and spend Liberal to be found .
2 . This amendment may be cited as the Constitution Amendment , year of proclamation ( Quebec ) .
we are about to enter the 21 st century .
one thing that disturbed me was when the member spoke of his youth .
we agree .
we have produced a document called " Beyond a Balanced Budget '' .
i want to take advantage of the occasion to commend the good work that is done by Correctional Service Canada whose 300 executives sat in this House last night .
i call on the government to support the call for a full public inquiry in Ontario .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
on September 7 my hometown of Summerland was shocked by the news of a double homicide .
there are a number of programs that once again take some of those youth with an understanding of the information highway and put them into small and medium size businesses to empower those businesses .
today instead of competing against one another , Canada ' s 110,000 wheat and barley farmers sell as one and can therefore command a higher price for their product .
Mr. Hec Clouthier
it refers to encouraging all Liberal friends to climb on board and show their ongoing personal and financial support .
i want to look at a few details of that this morning .
last week we listened with interest and with optimism to the Speech from the Throne opening this the 36 th session of Parliament .
that is now not the case .
the Conservative candidate was working out of my office , having given his office as a storage space for people who had to move out of their homes .
miss Deborah Grey
this member of the Bloc does know New Quebec .
but what is Canadian culture ?
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
this is very ironic given the fact that we now have allegations involving the party opposite .
i spoke earlier of the need for the government to provide leadership in policing .
the southern portion of my riding contains the largely rural townships of Osgoode , Rideau and Goulbourn .
it would be a welcome addition to part I of the labour code .
that , not later than fifteen minutes before the expiry of the time provided for the consideration of Government Orders on the seventh allotted day in the said period , the Speaker shall interrupt any proceedings before the House and shall put forthwith and successively , without further debate or amendment , all questions necessary to dispose of any item falling under the business of supply , including any opposition motion and all motions relating to Main Estimates and Supplementary Estimates and to any Appropriation Act or Acts based thereon ; provided
almost one million jobs have been created since 1993 , we are witnessing the longest sustained increase in youth employment since 1990 , consumer and business confidence are up , a balanced budget is within our grasp , interest rates are at an all time low .
the only reason the throne speech took such a positive tone is the successes of Canadians over the last four years .
they were asked by the government not to fish any more because the stocks had decreased and there was a need to give the resource time to replenish itself .
he said it was the amendments that caused him to move closure .
however , it completely ignores what they said about equality of citizens and provinces , and it completely ignores the subject to which they devoted three - quarters of their communique , namely a process to involve the public at the front end of the consideration of any proposals having to do with national unity .
i want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the women who preceded us and who worked so that , today , the situation has improved somewhat , thanks to the many battles they fought .
i think this is where the member is looking at absolute jurisdictions like Chile .
the reality is that tax cuts will not necessarily lead to job growth .
one question they asked me was about donations to the New Democratic Party member .
the leader of the Conservative Party used that tactic during the last election and we all know how it backfired .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
hon. members in the Reform Party , and no doubt in other parties as well , will tell the House that when people come to their town hall meetings the issue that is highest on their agenda is the issue of pensions .
a recipient of many awards and honours , including the Order of Canada , she was truly one of the key founders of professional theatre in Canada .
the member should rather be thankful since many ridings , even ridings of government members , have lost their employment centre .
evidence was put forward by three federal government departments and many others from across the country who are concerned about this project .
canada is in a global marketplace .
that will be gone .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz
they voted on the wheat board advisory .
we have a constitution that says that interprovincial trade must be free and open .
we have followed with interest the situation in Ontario .
Mr. Yvon Godin
that would do something to deal with the problem of the hike in premiums that the government is proposing and 300,000 seniors would be lifted right off the tax roll .
we will press not only government but also caucus members to do that to ensure that the best kinds of jobs will be in place for Canadians .
canada has always been regarded as a world leader and a driving force on the critical issues that threaten the preservation of our environment .
Canadian pension plan premiums are going up by 77 percent over 1996 levels .
one is a bill for constituent assemblies , the other is an ironclad guarantee of constitutional referenda at the end of the day .
let us start practising high tech if we believe in high tech and not just talking about it .
building safer communities is one of the government ' s key objectives .
as the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board has said , the operations of the CWB will also be improved by the access it will have to modern risk management tools that would allow a forward contracting system .
Mr. Speaker , I rise to say a few words in tribute to Mr. Claude Ellis who was a member of Parliament elected for the CCF in the city of Regina in 1953 and again in 1957 .
it is now incumbent on us to work together as a Canadian family to build a better and stronger Canada for our children .
therefore it would be improper , if not unfair , to speculate and create innuendo about something that is under investigation , unless the hon. member wants to take steps to prevent the investigation from reaching a successful conclusion .
it probably had shares in Bre - X.
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron ( Verch 猫 res , BQ ) :
the minister may bring about the total demise of the Canadian Wheat Board with the legislation .
* * *
hon. Jim Peterson
the prime suspect is the ex - husband of Tammy who was on day parole .
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) :
yet today Liberals are talking about something in the thousands of dollars which is 10 times what their initial promises were .
as we recently saw in the newspapers , the situation is getting out of hand .
since high interest rates shut off job creation , the minister must now finally explore the only other avenue that will create jobs : lower taxes .
we are certainly not there yet when it comes to solving all the problems of the country .
according to Beauchesne ' s rules , these sorts of statements are inappropriate -
i am honoured to have the opportunity to serve the people of Guelph - Wellington for a second term , a term that will end in the next century .
but do you know that the plight of young people is a source of concern , particularly the high rate of unemployment and poverty ?
the minister then answered those questions on behalf of the government first , by saying that in the opinion of the federal government section 93 can be amended pursuant to section 43 of the Constitution Act , 1982 .
the Bloc should understand that Quebec is a part of Canada and that it is important for it to acknowledge the benefits it gets by being a part of Canada .
i would also like to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on your re - election and the election of all the deputy Speakers .
some hon. members :
( motion agreed to )
Mr. Speaker , I would like to salute the millions of Canadians who are celebrating international seniors day .
does the proposed amendment meet the national interest ?
i do not think the Liberals should be expecting any praise for the prediction of a balanced budget .
Mr. Myron Thompson
it is nice to hear from him today and I have a question for him .
the timing of these suspicious grants is certainly questionable and we are going to continue to ask the questions that need to be asked .
is there sufficient protection for minority groups not only in Quebec but across Canada if this amendment should pass ?
another study by Department of Finance officials Lori Marchildon , Tim Sargent and Joe Ruggeri in March 1996 classified CPP premiums as payroll taxes and found that employer payroll taxes invariably lead to a rise in the employer ' s labour costs in the short run and a reduction in employment .
for someone from the Conservative ranks to be raising an issue like this one after they were prepared , when they were in government , to spend an exorbitant amount of taxpayers ' money to buy helicopters that were far in excess of our needs , is a little bit of gall .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
bill C - 225 .
my point today is quite simple .
the government asked them to do without so it would not have to do without too much itself and have fewer cuts to make .
at that time he was honoured appropriately on the Hill .
it is all about priorities .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye :
forty percent of francophones in Quebec and Canada are bilingual , compared to only 8 percent for anglophones .
we must continue to reach out to our fellow citizens , strengthen our bond and our identity as Canadians .
in my area of Niagara where we have some 31 cottage wineries a partnership with IRAP has created a special wine industry , known worldwide , receiving many medals .
we have CPP , seniors benefits and the RRSP program which gives an 18 percent tax shelter on income .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
i would also like to thank the residents of Sault Ste. Marie for giving me the honour of representing them in the House of Commons .

the sustainability of the Pacific salmon fishery is at stake and the minister of fisheries sits on his hands and does nothing except criticize his own citizens .
it is the third point on fiscal responsibility which I will focus on .
if the government meant what it said when it talked about job creation , it would have consistently reduced employment insurance premiums , because they kill employment .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
it is therefore no exaggeration to say that the future of the Canadian Wheat Board has been exhaustively discussed and debated .
i remember Clyde Wells very well , sometimes with pride and sometimes with not so much pride .

Mr. Speaker , when I travel abroad I travel with all the premiers of Canada who are always very delighted to travel on team Canada .
frankly I find it astounding that a government which has said that its number one priority is jobs is putting forward a bill that affects the paycheques of most employees in this country and affects the payrolls of most employers in this country and has not offered a single substantive word on the real employment effects of the payroll tax hike required to fund the CPP investment board established by this bill .

the Speaker :
Mr. Speaker , I thank you for the opportunity to speak today against the Reform motion and that of the Liberal Party .
we are also pursuing many other avenues to address other issues that they brought forward related to grain marketing and transportation .
Mr. John Harvard
the minister ' s response takes the side of the bureaucrats , not just against this member of Parliament but against the interests of ordinary people who would find her answer utterly incomprehensible , as do the members on this side of the House .
however , we can do our job in a spirit of respect for one another and for this institution .
it is changing for Canada and for all other nations of the world .
an hon. member :
during the election campaign , the Prime Minister promised job creation would be a priority .
these initiatives include the appointment of a third party manager to manage the day to day operations of the Stony First Nation , the initiation of a forensic audit of the band operations and the establishment of a joint task force to examine the conditions on reserve and develop proposals to address them .
i will continue to work with provincial and territorial governments as they redirect some of their social assistance resources into complementary benefits and services to help children in low income families , especially the working poor .

reformers believe that Canadians are generous and compassionate and given the chance will make decisions with their money that will benefit their fellow citizens everywhere .
by the end of the 19 th century the governing party , the Conservative Party , had run out of leadership , ideas and energy .
Canadians want that .
i look forward to debating this issue in the future because this must take place .
i remind you that a committee addressed this matter only four months ago , with the suggestion that more legislative counsels be added , contrary to what has been done recently .
it does not involve taxing small businesses into bankruptcy and it most certainly does not involve scattering public money all over the nation in an attempt to buy votes .

Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) :

the other side of the coin is that we have to continue to reduce costs and find better ways of doing the job .

Mr. Michel Gauthier
Mr. Stan Dromisky ( Thunder Bay - Atikokan , Lib . ) :
the government does not seem to be too upset , since nothing is provided for women in the throne speech .
it provides survivor benefits , death benefits and disability benefits to people who are unable to work .
it is with this in mind that I intend to make the government accountable for the devastating effect that has resulted from the cuts to health care through the CHST .
they have been tabled and if anyone wants to see them , they have only to pay for copies from the returning officer in my riding .
what action is the government taking to ensure the accessibility and regulation of natural health remedies to protect both consumers and practitioners ?
part of the balance means that the government will not bend from its pledge to Canadians to invest in the future of our young people .
thereby more and more taxpayers ' dollars would be sent to the financial organizations of the world instead of financing and paying for needed social programs .
in this way contributions will increase by .4 percent this coming year or about $ 24 and will go up to 9.9 percent of income by the year 2003 .
i welcome the new members of the House of Commons to this institution .

Mr. Rick Laliberte
all CPP benefits will remain fully indexed , as will QPP benefits .
Mr. Jim Pankiw :
it must also be fair to the people who will have to pay the costs , to the people who are now being asked to double their contributions into the plan for no greater benefit , for actually less benefit than they were promised , for less benefit than present beneficiaries receive .
simply put , they have been evasive , sloppy and inaccurate .
Mr. Speaker , I realize you have already visited our lovely region and enjoyed the beauty of the St. Lawrence and our forests .

Mr. Speaker , yesterday , on four separate occasions , the Prime Minister was asked what action he had taken after being advised of allegations of influence peddling within the Liberal Party of Canada , he repeated each time that his minister had done his duty in following instructions .
i assure you that you have my confidence as you carry out your duties .
we are one .
i would like to remind the member that it is very easy to speak of accountability but the Reform Party has an absolute exclusivity on actions when it comes to accountability .
the issues raised by the ongoing investigation into allegations of influence peddling throws the whole federal government contract award process into question .
this bill if passed will allow members of the boards of directors of Canadian corporations the defence of due diligence in the conduct and performance of their duties and responsibilities .
the formula the premiers saw fit to accept a few weeks ago is a new one which describes the Quebec reality , something we continue to fight for , while the Bloc Quebecois , in the House of Commons , and the Parti Quebecois , in the National Assembly , have voted against anything which could accommodate Quebec so as to enable it to prosper within Canada .

hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
however , it has not been completed .
Mr. Speaker , I rise in the House for the first time in my new career as a federal politician to congratulate the citizens of my riding of Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford for their magnificent community spirit and fund - raising efforts which have resulted in the development of the new Royal Victoria Hospital .
i am not accusing him of doing the opposite .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
but paragraphs ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are intended as sections of general application to all provinces .
he is my greatest advisor .
the activities and the government ' s response prove that these loopholes still exist and that these loopholes are large enough to drive large kickbacks through .
will the hon. members please leave the voting area after voting .
enforcement of this legislation could have been extended to provincially held land , and all provincial environmental ministers opposed it .
i will end on a question that is still topical .
how could they have not told us ? "

it is at this time that I would like to pay tribute to Mr. Knowles , the former member for Winnipeg North Centre , whose association with this place stretched over 50 years , 55 years from the time he was first elected in 1942 up until 1997 when he was still serving as an honorary officer of the table , with the exception of the four years that he spent out of office from 1958 to 1962 .

we sat down with Canadians , we sat down with the provinces and we came up with a solution that I think is the fairest and most reasonable solution .

senator Thompson ' s attendance record is the worst in the Senate .
it is interesting that last week when the Leader of the Opposition was interviewed by a newspaper in Atlantic Canada he alluded to some of the poorer parts of his province which sometimes we do not understand .
Mr. Greg Thompson
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew :
there are areas throughout Canada .
what a waste of money .
in Longueuil , we proved that when people want something , when they put all their energy into a plan in which they believe and a dream they cherish , the combined strength of these individuals can move mountains .
Mr. Jean Dub 茅 :
i would like to refer the member to some statistics that I have put together here with certain American states .
Canadians and this government cannot tolerate this problem in its present state .
the right thing to do now is to wait for the investigation to run its course .
Mr. Gary Pillitteri :
it is very clear at least from the perspective of many members , certainly from Ontario and right across the country , that what we said is what we are about to do .
in my province alone , Ontario , well over 2,200 firms have been assisted by our students to be connected to the Internet .

the federal government will use final offer selection arbitration once they have legislated either a locked out group or a struck group back to work .
Mr. Speaker , it is in fact because we have given and continue to give ministers advice on this issue on a regular basis that the minister acted on this swiftly .
and let us not forget our excellent maple syrup , a favourite with everyone .
i was frankly surprised when I first opened the speech from the throne that some of the big headings were not the regional interests of the country .

speech FROM THE THRONE
the fourth thing that Canadians did in 1997 was allow a 10 year old federal party , with roots in the west and proud of it , and with aspirations to become a truly national party , to occupy the role of official opposition and to become the alternative to the government .
i noticed a smile from my hon. colleague in the New Democratic Party .
indeed , Davie Industries executives have been waiting for months for a positive reply to a request for financial security from the Export Development Corporation , in order to execute a $ 125 - million contract with Petrobras , a Brazilian crown corporation .
how can they be shown to prepare for the future , whether it is financial responsibility or responsibility for one ' s own life ?
the fact that we have demonstrated our ability as a country to set ambitious goals and achieve them gives us new confidence to set higher goals for the years ahead and succeed .
this is small comfort to those who have paid the price for its lack of planning and vision over the past four years .
as for evidence being carried over from one parliament to another , the Chair must deal with the evidence that is put before the Chair .
can we imagine setting up an inquiry such as the Krever inquiry and then creating legal roadblocks , as it has done , interfering with Krever ' s mandate .
this government recognizes the importance of these initiatives as evidenced by the recent announcement by the Minister of Justice that $ 150 million will be allocated over the next five years to foster such community based programs .
one of the basic tenets of Reform Party ' s principles is to reform the Senate .
i am sure all Canadians join me in being thankful for her life .

the Quebec Provincial Police was supposed to take over security at Mirabel airport tomorrow , October 1 .
in a few minutes the Clerk will be able to provide that list .
it will , however , incorporate several specific economic policies and help fund the growth that should normally be experienced within a few years in several areas of our economy .
we are very proud to be one of the original nationalities , but I believe that Canada has room for all the different people who come to this country .
no , this is not the way .
Mr. Dan McTeague ( Pickering - Ajax - Uxbridge , Lib . ) : moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 235 , an act to amend the Competition Act ( protection of those who purchase products from vertically integrated suppliers who compete with them at retail ) .
that is not the way we operate because we are prepared to operate in consultation and co - operation with our provincial counterparts .
they all talk about doom and gloom .
this year it is drier than ever and the few bones that are in it rattle together with an ominous sound '' .
we recently had a provincial byelection in Portage .
upon reading the throne speech , one cannot help but conclude that the federal government is trying to get involved in areas under provincial jurisdiction and to enhance its visibility .
i fail to understand the concern of the member for Portage - Lisgar .
what does he do ?
we are looking to our future together with a new optimism .
motion negatived
in order to build a stronger Canada , our government will invest in children , in quality care and good health , and will take steps to ensure the safety of our communities .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i suggest they join us to continue building this country .
i would like to turn to the subject of the reform of the Canadian Wheat Board .
on the other hand the Tories avoided solutions .
we might expect that Reform would now honour its commitment to democracy and accept the wishes of the majority .
i would also like to congratulate the 4,000 young men and women who came from all 10 provinces and 2 territories and demonstrated both the spirit of sport and the spirit of unity .
i want to inform them that the people of Sackville - Eastern Shore , Nova Scotia elected me to come to the House of Commons for political solutions , not political interference .

it is something they never had and can not understand .
supreme COURT OF CANADA
the bottom line of our analysis is that it fails to significantly improve the accountability of Canadian Wheat Board producers in the manner that is being demanded by producers and required for the 21 st century .
the cultural and educational sectors will also be part of a team marketing products that generate wealth and employment while enhancing Canada ' s image in the world and making us proud to be Canadians .
we want to say that we honoured him greatly and we still do in the remembrance of him .
i hope I can continue to show that I am working on their behalf and respect that they have put their faith in me .
i also point out to the hon. member that this is not a case of conditional sentencing and that this is a case the attorney general of Quebec , who has responsibility for this matter , has decided to appeal .
i have a great concern about that .
to preserve and improve our federation is to preserve and improve the way we live .
introduction and first reading
that is the commitment of the government and that is what Bill C - 2 accomplishes .

the Government is determined to do more to support innovation and risk - taking in Canada and to attract more foreign investment in knowledge - based industries to Canada .
named for the World War II warship HMS Ajax , the town is a living monument to the allied efforts during that time .
so bitter was Amerasinghe ' s attack on Judge Jerome that John Sims blacked out those portions of Amerasinghe ' s memo before he passed it on to the members of the litigation committee .
in this sense , the Canada pension plan investment board seems like an interesting idea .
i am glad that he used the American example because it lets me remind people that this whole agenda of the Reform Party is not new .
throughout the consultations and reports that have marked the past 30 years , a consensus has emerged on the need to reorganize school structures along linguistic , rather than denominational , lines .
the premiums are estimated by some to be around $ 500 million for that work .
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
my wife Lynda , nee Burelle , is ninth generation .
delegates will gain invaluable opportunities to learn more about Asia - Pacific , the world ' s fastest growing region , and meet visiting youth from the Philippines , Malaysia , Thailand , Cambodia , Vietnam as well Asian youth studying in Canada .
that Standing Order 104 ( 2 ) be amended in subsections ( h ) and ( j ) be deleting the word " sixteen " and substituting therefor the word " eighteen '' .
it was very good .
Mr. Speaker , I want to say a word in support of the question of privilege before the House and to welcome the Reform Party to the feeling we have been having for years .
i want to say to her that I had an opportunity during the last sitting of the House to work with her people with respect to their needs .
Mr. Speaker , we just heard a remark from someone who I think had better brush up on the rules .
i know of no other province that does not have other demands .
what Reform would like to propose to the House is the following .
fisheries
long live the great family of the Canadian Medical Association , its twelve independent provincial and territorial divisions and its 42 affiliates .
indeed , just last week the Liberal premier of Nova Scotia and the former Conservative premier of Nova Scotia both acknowledged that Donkin is the future of Devco .
they were people who cared deeply about their community and their country , people for whom politics was not merely a job but an opportunity to serve their fellow Canadians in one of our great national institutions .
managed trade is not freer trade and one way trade is a dead end .
our government will continue to give young people the hope for the future through programs targeted at youth .
madam Speaker , congratulations on your appointment to the Chair .
Ms. Val Meredith
the shares of the corporation are to be issued to the Minister of Finance , to be held on behalf of the crown by the Minister of Finance .
health
Mr. Speaker , I am trying to discern what the member ' s question is .
Mr. Nelson Riis :
members should think about the impact that this will have on their grandchildren and the taxes they will be forced to pay .
Mr. Nelson Riis :
i submit that the national unity problem will never be resolved until we deal adequately and fairly with our aboriginal people .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
our investments in Brazil , Argentina , Chile and Mexico have gone up .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
none of those things are in the throne speech .
we have the impression that other ministers besides the Minister of Human Resources Development were aware of this investigation and we also have the impression that the Prime Minister was warned by the Minister of Human Resources Development that such an investigation was under way .
we are out of time .
there are dozens and dozens of ideas .
Mr. Speaker , it is not unprecedented for a prime minister who cares about Canada ' s trade promotion , which creates jobs both at home and abroad , to send such letters .
i am greatly concerned about the future , about environmental questions , about a lot of issues , but one in particular which this House must discuss , namely the widening gap between the rich and poor .
the Association des retrait 茅 s d ' Ahuntsic , the Association qu 茅 b 茅 coise de g 茅 rontologie , and numerous seniors clubs such as the John Caboto , Henri Julien and Notre - Dame - de - Pompei clubs are all active in my riding .
they do not know if they will be able to send their kids to college .

former American Vice - President Hubert Humphrey said of government " the impersonal hand of government can never replace the helping hand of a neighbour '' .

some profoundly important work gets done .
i am hard at work recruiting many of the local businesses in Perth - Middlesex to participate because what is good for Canadian trade is better for Perth - Middlesex trade because that is the 21 st century commerce .
balancing the exclusion clause is an inclusion clause .
i understand that he cares a great deal about young Canadians and especially the young people in his riding .
i think this is very much progress and an improvement .
i also agree that it is very clear that the Liberal government has acted in concert with multinational corporations .
Mr. Jerry Pickard
i have to tell the hon. member that the government does not determine its policies on the basis of Globe and Mail editorials .
Mr. Randy White :
it erodes the system that was established in 1966 to provide all members of the paid labour force in Canada a base upon which to build their retirement income , as well as provide benefits in the case of serious disability or death .
allowing a private hospital to operate paves the way for two - tier health care .
the Reform Party voted against it .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano
members should read the estimates and they will discover that the Canada pension plan is a separately administered pension plan .
with the expected budget surplus , they are paying out big bucks for the right to trample over provincial jurisdictions .
we must continue the transformation of our social programs in response to new and difficult circumstances .
two - thirds of the directors of this organization will be from the producers themselves , and I find absolutely nothing wrong with that .
Mr. Speaker , the new measures announced by the United States are extremely damaging to Canadian and to American business .

canada ' s most endangered species is a federal Liberal politician willing to take any responsibility to protect our natural environment .
we can look at the fund .
to ignore that or to say it is not true is to put one ' s head in the sand .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
pay EQUITY
if the current trend continues , the child poverty rate will have doubled by then .
people need to know how to respond in an emergency .
today it is they who make up a class that was once middle or called working but is no longer .
they told us that they needed to know it would be there when they retired or if they became disabled .
the Speaker :
it is because the people very seldom reject a government if the economy is moving well as evidenced in just about every election in the United States and Canada in the last 100 years .
they really believe that Liberal politicians and big government bureaucrats know better how to spend a dollar raised from the taxpayers than does a family or small business person or someone who is struggling to get a foot up in the labour market .
the throne speech again shows that the voters of Rosemont - Petite - Patrie were right in their choice .
does he propose more of the same while he admits that what he has had in the past really does not work ?
there were hundreds of children running around with face paint and hotdogs screaming with glee as they knocked someone off the chair into the dunk tank .
corporations are learning that social marketing is good for business .
Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr 芒 ce - Lachine , Lib . ) :
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
the third solitude is the millions of Canadians who no longer believe that Canada ' s strengths are their strengths or that Canada ' s gains are their gains .
it is an important first principle that all parties debating the bill support income security for seniors and for all Canadians as a primary objective .
* * *
anyone who has read the throne speech knows that it follows up on the commitments made by the prime minister and the Liberal Party during the election .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal
it is so basic , yet it is so hard to understand why the government in its throne speech can talk about spending more and not talk about trying to spend what it had a lot more wisely .
Canadian passports belong to the Canadian government .
you know that , according to the amending formula of the Constitution Act , 1982 , there are five ways to amend the Constitution .
when any bill is brought from the Senate , the question " That this bill be read a first time " shall be deemed carried , without debate , amendment or question put .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz
young Canadians are living in a country well - positioned for opportunities in the new economy .
it is important given its absence from the national agenda in the past years .
if this bill is passed , one will be required to have worked during two of the past three years or five of the past six to be eligible for disability benefits .
further , I was told about the real importance of developing strong community structures such as co - operative business development and the need to continue spending dollars on infrastructure which brings new technologies such as fibre optic cable and ISDN connections to the community .
Mr. Speaker , never .
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the question .
if Liberal Party ministers or employees made mistakes or did not comply with a basic code of conduct , they will , sooner or later , have to pay for their mistakes , because no one will trust them any more , and rightly so .
it was a shame that the government of Canada did not have the same commitment to the port .
she referred to damage done by the Liberal government ' s first mandate .
it combines firmness with good humour and Mr. Fraser was well known for his keen sense of humour .
Mr. Speaker , except for Premier Bouchard , who did not attend the Calgary conference , all of Canada ' s provincial premiers agreed to put the question on national unity to the Canadian people .
it is good social policy too .
as Canadians we are all free citizens .
even if the supreme court were to determine that it is acceptable to use the section 43 amending formula to give Quebec powers that are not available to other provinces , the use of an amending formula that excludes most Canadians in order to grant special status to one province violates the principle of equality of provinces .
agreed .
report OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL OF CANADA
we have set up a transitional job creation fund .
we should seize this opportunity to set up school boards along linguistic lines .
quite clearly there is not a scenario where one can be done without the other .
hon. Paul Martin
the solicitor general said yesterday they could be on one side of the House or his side of the House , or it could involve any Canadian .
despite my differences with Frank McKenna from time to time , I have never questioned his sincere commitment to serve the people of his province as he saw fit .
that is the whole point of what has been happening in this federation to date .
it is therefore in the majority ' s interest to have protection of minority rights and minority interests and the best way to do that is through rigorous adherence to the rule of law .
i do not think there is any debate that Canadians cannot afford a public pension plan .
as I say , we see now some modest changes .
we think the government owes it to Canadians to get an assurance from Israel that our passports will not be used in covert operations ever again .
indeed , the reports and consultations that have taken place in Quebec show that a consensus has emerged .
Mr. Hec Clouthier
i want to ask the minister something specific .
i had occasion to have supper with Mr. Ellis about 18 months ago when he was in Ottawa with his wife Bessie and we talked about a lot of important issues affecting our country .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
i will reserve judgment until I hear from the minister , but as the hon. whip of the Reform Party mentioned , I would encourage the government House leader to see to it that the minister is here to respond at the earliest possible moment .
many of our universities across Canada participate in networks of centres of excellence where they link together and work together for research and development .
action has already been taken by this government to consolidate the OAS and GIS into what we call the proposed seniors benefit which is designed to help those most in need .
i never knew Canada until I sat at kitchen tables in Saskatchewan , skiied in the Rockies , walked on the tundra in the Arctic , played pool on Fogo Island in Newfoundland , and talked with aboriginal elders around fires .
they all agree that a universal plan , an affordable plan and a secure plan is necessary .

if we want to consider language rights , we would have to consult section 173 of the Charte de la langue fran 莽 aise and of course the Charte qu 茅 b 茅 coise des droits de la personne .
what ' s so often overlooked is that communities and regions have enormous human resources capable of providing the energy , commitment and leadership skills needed to create a new attitude and direction .
it is this principle which enabled Laurier and his successors to bridge the ethnic , racial and cultural differences which characterize Canada .
another key element of our plan is addressing the needs of youth .
reformers strive for responsible and accountable government rather than merely the current representative government .
what I wish to say is that , when the hon. member talks history , he must not forget that the two founding peoples include French Canadians throughout Canada , and not just in Quebec .
Mr. Werner Schmidt :
it is a proud moment for Canada , not a time for partisan jealously .
MIRABEL AIRPORT
in what year ?
bloc QUEBECOIS LEADER
Mr. Speaker , Bloc Quebecois members would appreciate hearing the hon. member ' s speech , regardless of whether or not they agree with it .
both of his grandfathers were distinguished statesmen serving in Parliament and at the provincial and territorial levels .
the minister mentioned that he was involved at a very young age .
Mr. Speaker , the Reform Party obviously does not like the Canada pension plan .
of course , I would like to start by thanking the voters in Mercier for having put their trust in me again .
to try to label everybody in parliament with going out at election time to raise money and maybe buy political favours with it is very unfortunate in the Parliament of Canada .
moreover , after taking over 30 years to partially withdraw from the manpower training sector , this same federal government is now seeking , six months later , to maintain , confirm and increase its involvement in youth training .
i hope he can stay in the House in order to qualify for it .
if she is disturbed with a couple of the promises that we made in our election platform , can she imagine how disturbed we are with most that they made in theirs ?
let me talk for a moment about the social safety net .
most members of the House were not here prior to 1993 . I think he should also acknowledge that .
we do not have unanimous consent .
since then , I have aged and , since May 15 , at 50 years of age , I have been eligible to join seniors clubs .

Mr. Mauril B 茅 langer
we must continue to make our Canadian voice heard distinctly and bravely among other nations in the world .
they were not in agreement .
* * *
we have the time but first we have to go to a zero deficit .
Mr. Speaker , the one point I would like to make is a point which I made during my speech .
Thursday , October 9 , 1997
the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada has already come up with a plan that will give Canadians a vision , a down to earth plan for the future of our country .
canada was strong .
these are some of the concerns we have at second reading .
we want to support it .
Mr. Speaker , I have one piece of information of which I would like you to be aware .
* * *
they are trying to climb back up the cliffs at the Plains of Abraham in their search for their identity , when the place to seek our identity is in what lies around us , in our own experiences , in the people we encounter and in what we do with our lives , not just in wondering what our origins are and who did what .
the only thing that remains to be considered is whether the postponement of the reporting date is appropriate .
Mr. Allan Kerpan
remember the rhetoric of its leader saying that it is a grassroots party and that it will listen to the people .
Mr. Werner Schmidt
i have notice of a question of privilege .
i would like to begin by saying that , strictly from the standpoint of principle , the Bloc Quebecois supports Bill C - 4 , with a few reservations that I will mention .
it seems to me that we invite an infinite reductionism of self - determination the minute we get into the question of separation .
this bill is about the protection of our public records .
the Speaker :
may I also say that we intend to be vigilant in our surveillance and in our regulations to protect Canadians from threats to their food and to the environment .
members
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) :
finally , levels of contribution must parallel the growth of the economy , because we certainly need that .
it is one of the most widespread chronic diseases in Canada , and cases of long term disability are most frequently due to arthritis .
dear colleague , I think he heard the question .
our objective will be to achieve in the provision of its services a standard of excellence .
mining
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
i am surprised that the finance department let the parliamentary secretary get away with this omission .
madam Speaker , I think all my colleagues here in this House heard the derogatory remarks made by the member for Bourassa , who called the members of my party hypocrites .
we are consulting all interested parties and I intend to take action when we are ready .
Mr. Joe Jordan ( Leeds - Grenville , Lib . ) :
hon. Herb Gray
the tough decisions and sacrifices that Canadians made have served to open doors of opportunity for us as a country .
Mr. Hec Clouthier ( Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke , Lib . ) :
second , we know that there was absolutely no acknowledgement in the throne speech that Canada has a debt of $ 600 billion .
the way the House leader put it is a little open - ended , which is tomorrow or at some later date .
* * *
world MARITIME WEEK
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
an election campaign is a moment for the country to stop , to reflect , to look back and hopefully to look forward .
Mr. Speaker , I did not hear a question there but in reply to my colleague ' s comments , I can only underscore the need to have some sort of process in place to encourage the parties to come to an agreement on their own .
i assure the hon. member that chief among our priorities will be the accountability of First Nations for the money that is spent .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to give the hon. member three pieces of information .
* * *
under these proposals , pensionable earnings would be based on the applicant ' s maximum pensionable earnings at the time of disability .
like many other Canadians , I am pressed for time by my work schedule and my other activities .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the President of the Treasury Board with regard to the concerns raised in the most recent report by the access to information commissioner .
madam Speaker , fortunately , my hon. colleague ' s concerns are not shared by investors around the world .
during the last Parliament it sought authority to disband the Canada port police through Bill C - 44 .
we recognize where that comes from .
this detail is the key to the whole question .
perhaps he could get away with it in this House but certainly not in front of any financial audience or any audience of pensioners .
Mr. Speaker , the federal government through its various programs in collaboration with partners has been able to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions by half since the 1980 s .
Mr. Preston Manning
truly I wonder what is going on here .
i saw the hon. member .
i would like to talk about another phrase which may upset him , the phrase about the existing legislation that allows for a wide range of abuses .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
Mr. Ken Epp
at the same time as we sit here today , the Minister of Finance has tabled legislation in the House to radically change the way seniors receive their pensions .
communities it turns out are the best places to address a range of problems from poverty and unemployment to human resources development .
what about the small business , the extra tax on small business ?
i thought that was wrong .
i am concerned with the government ' s approach in a few areas and would like to ask the minister some questions on that .
as members of Parliament , it is our duty to ensure that the financial future of all Canadians is secure and that Canadians will continue to have confidence in the Canada pension plan .
this qualifier adds to the uniqueness .
Mr. Speaker , it is difficult for me to find the right words to express , fully but calmly , my outrage at what the Bloc member for Rimouski - Mitis had to say .
they begin to say " what does it matter what I do , who cares ? "
that , subject to provisions of this Order , the business of supply shall otherwise be conducted in accordance with Standing Order 81 .
the truth of the matter is that this government refuses to accept that taxes kill jobs .
we have to keep the principles of accountability and transparency , which were mentioned in the throne speech .
an hon. member :
we are all very privileged to be members of this Parliament .
we are not there yet .
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) :
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
( official Version )
we will balance the budget by 1998 - 99 .
of course the Government of Quebec has a different plan .
the LATE DUDLEY GEORGE
the Speaker :
if any member whose name I have just read wishes to withdraw as a candidate for the second ballot , will that member please rise in his place and state the reason ?
last winter our people experienced unemployment at the rate of 25 percent .
i think the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board could be in trouble if some of its investments went to certain regions rather than others .
Mr. Bob Kilger
for example , we know that in the very near future we will be consulting across the country on the next budget .
in addition , Quebec taxpayers are not ready to see their tax dollars go toward making up the Canadian Wheat Board ' s deficits .
Mr. Bob Mills
the Parliament was asked on four occasions to use this amending formula , and you will recall that two of these cases concerned Newfoundland .
this time around the Liberals have already gone well beyond what the Tories did .
it is a mistake .
Mr. Dennis J . Mills ( Broadview - Greenwood , Lib . ) :
Mr. Preston Manning
surrounding communities have shown interest in replicating the unique Newmarket Youth Centre model as it has proven to be an effective and successful way to empower and engage youth with community partners .
but having such assets is not enough .
amendment
i want to say a few words about my riding .
in fact , this $ 600,000 grant to Videon was reported and announced a full month after a letter went to the police from the minister of HRD to turn in this Liberal money man .
my wife and many of the emotionally sensitive people in my campaign were in tears on a daily basis .
tags can also be put into the same position as the two major problems we had with the two floods , the one in the Saguenay and the one in the Winnipeg area .
Ms. Marlene Catterall
in fact , Quebec made money when it harmonized .
the third and final issue that the committee must address is :
i am not blind and I do not think I am all that deaf , but nonetheless these things were not talked about during the campaign .
if they had stuck their head in the sand a little bit longer , then the hike would actually have been 14 % .
i want to make a couple of points on this particular issue .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Carmen Provenzano ( Sault Ste. Marie , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I begin my first speech in this assembly of democracy feeling a tremendous sense of responsibility given to me by the people in my constituency of Winnipeg North Centre , a constituency which is recognized right across this country as a symbol , as an example of the struggle for dignity , equality and justice in society today .
there is another clipping here sent by a constituent who wanted me to remember that September 20 marked the 80 th anniversary of the birth of the income tax in Canada .
Mr. Speaker , I did not mean to impugn the integrity of any member of the House .
this good management has made it possible to keep interest and inflation rates at their lowest .
[ editor ' s Note :
you can see how candid the member for Abitibi is ; he says the method is the same .
i came to the House 31 years ago , I guess it will be in a few days .
at the same time , the amending formula which the federal and Quebec governments propose to apply to this amendment is that provided for by section 43 of the Constitution Act of 1982 .
this is of serious concern to me , not so much for producers as for sport and cultural events .
also , if Canadian agents were involved in this mission somehow then that puts this Jordan operation in a different light as well .
therefore , it is incumbent on us to do our utmost to give Canadians a fresh start and to ease the tax burden .
my question to the prime minister is who does he think would spend any surplus more wisely , Liberal politicians and bureaucrats or those families and businesses ?
the Government welcomes the action being taken by the private sector , through initiatives such as Career Edge and the Corporate Council on Youth in the Economy , and encourages the private sector to do more .
privilege
Mr. Myron Thompson :
i am surprised that the member is not speaking to us wearing hemp sackcloth clothing and living on bean sprouts .
because of the outright refusal of the government to deal with the simple , straightforward questions that have been posed to it on the floor of the House of Commons , we have this sudden shroud and feeling of insecurity on the part of people both inside and outside the House .
i want to ask the member of Parliament for Calgary Southeast if he will undertake to make sure in this Parliament that he will champion eliminating all of those hidden unaccountable tax expenditures , especially those that go to the oil and gas industry in western Canada .
i want to review the most important of those changes and to indicate where our caucus can support them and where we feel further amendments are required .
hon. Fred Mifflin ( Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State ( Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard
this is very important for the country and the jobs that need to be created .
there are just 20 federal appeal board judges to handle this huge backlog and a waiting period of up to four years for Canadians who need this pension .
consultations have also taken place with groups representing specific sectors of the Canadian economy , including culture , energy , mining , telecommunications and agrifood .
they acknowledge that there have been many challenges , but they appreciate that for the first time in 30 years the Government of Canada will not have to face a crushing deficit , a deficit that was systematically and rapidly destroying our ability to care for those who need help the most .
it will not only dispense some financial help , it will also provide support to the entrepreneurs in all of their endeavours .
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
back in Ottawa the government announces new spending initiatives to satisfy a few narrow interests as it claims a balanced budget will soon arrive and perhaps then it will take a look at letting Canadians keep more of their own money .
i have read some of those reports .
Mr. Yvon Godin
there is also Senator Rivest , who was also an adviser to Robert Bourassa , who said that the Quebec Liberal Party should distance itself from its friends in the Liberal Party of Canada .
Mr. Gerry Byrne ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources , Lib . ) :
it was a fight between Quebeckers about the appropriateness of the patriation package .
we hope to have that decision -
the administration of disability benefits will be further improved .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand
Mr. Peter Adams
under existing legislation he will be able to apply for parole in 15 years , notwithstanding the sentencing recommendations of the judge .
i also ask the hon. member would he support the option of marking Canadian citizen on our census forms ?
inflation has been beaten down and is firmly under control .
i have two petitions to present which are identical in form and content also from residents of my riding .
with new technology there is no need for these pilotage charges , especially on the west coast .
as the member just pointed out , the former debate was on what would be a fair transfer from people who have more resources to people who have fewer resources .
we will also develop a national children ' s agenda and establish centres of excellence to deepen our understanding of children ' s development and well - being .
we have to increase the size of the pie before we can decide how to divide it up .
i alluded to the farmers in my constituency who have and will continue to put their money into their own grain handling facilities .
i asked Chester to represent the Government of Canada and to lay the wreath in Fredericton .
supreme COURT OF CANADA
we hope this time the words will be worth more than they were the last time they were spoken .
one wonders , given her long history with the former Conservative government , why she would try to grab headlines at the expense of a nation .
in light of these stunning failures I wonder whether the government will continue pinning all its trade hopes on a five day dog and pony show .
this is to ensure that it is Canadians who fund the Canadian electoral process .
it means the year 2000 and a new country .
it is the approach that Canadians have consistently said they support and will continue to support .
so , is the Reform Party member saying that the government should prevent Atlantic Canadians from getting employment insurance and let them starve ?
Mr. Speaker , it is a very great privilege and an honour that has been bestowed upon me today to make this motion which is to be seconded by the hon. member for Beauce for the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne .
Mr. Speaker , let me begin by welcoming you to your new position .
i would like to ask the member a question .
in the first year following harmonization , Quebec experienced a 2.7 percent increase , but no losses ; in the second year , a 20.4 percent increase in sales tax revenues and no losses ; in the third year , an increase of 17 -
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to have listened to that speech and yet I am terribly disappointed in some of the content of the speech .
the member for Richmond - Arthabaska has the floor .
Canadians will not soon forget the Saguenay floods or those of the Red River Valley .
Mrs. Maud Debien
this results from the 1996 program review cuts .
that is why we will be going into a joint committee over the next few months .
i can attest to the fact that today culture and multiculturalism are thriving not because of government funding but because people choose to do so on their own .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
how did the minister know ?
presence IN THE GALLERY
can we not , with a smaller government and lower taxes , create a far greater prosperity for our citizens ?
there is a further restriction , which is that the tax credits , once a certain amount is reached , become null and avoid .
sovereignty , with a proposal for partnership , is a forward looking plan that assures Quebecers and Canadians of prosperity in the century to come .
it is hard for many people , therefore , to contribute to an RRSP .
this would not be acceptable .
i was speaking with her the other day and I am shocked to hear that she will not be with us for the remainder of this Parliament .
the Deputy Speaker :
that is but one example of the vision that we need to show .
i do not want to dwell on that .
worse still , the federal government is now holding accountable the major Canadian cultural institutions which funded sovereignist Quebec artists .
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
because of that acceleration and because there were so few people working and making contributions there was no possibility of fully funding the plan .
is he prepared to tell this House and all Canadians that the free trade agreement was a very progressive measure and a very important one for all Canadians and explain why he came out so vehemently against the free trade agreement in a number of advertising campaigns that were extremely damaging for the future of our country ' s trade ?
what is important to understand is the position of the NDP .
* * *
we will probably put forward an amendment on that .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion :
these amounts are to be distributed among the provinces on the basis of population , and the federal government is required to transfer some of the money to help the provinces carry out their responsibilities in the area of health .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
quite the contrary .
Mr. Speaker , I have a question for the Prime Minister .
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
as a grade eight student , Taryn wrote an essay entitled " If I were the Prime Minister of Canada '' .
some hon. members :
just as leisure suits and lava lamps have had their day , and I got rid of mine , their contemporary , the CRTC , must also be re - examined for its relevance and desirability .
how many times do we have to have the chamber of commerce come before the finance committee and say " We do not want grants for business any more '' .
i am asking that the people of Matap 茅 dia - Matane get that money back .
despite our lingering concerns about this government ' s longer term trade agenda , we believe it is best to get on with Bill C - 4 .
Mr. Speaker , in light of last weekend ' s tragic incident in a Toronto subway , I want to address the desperate plight of the thousands of mentally ill in our country , people who have been deinstitutionalized without the support needed to allow them to lead safe and productive lives .
when we look at it , there is no question that it is a very vital program .
it is completely unacceptable to this government that anybody authorized by a government would use a Canadian passport to perpetrate any illegal action as they have done .
petitions
we will be renewing the national AIDS strategy .
Mr. Steve Mahoney
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
public office is a sacred trust and I believe that our role as parliamentarians is to listen to the people , act with fairness and wisdom , and to never forget that we are here to serve the interests of Canada .
he talked about the theoretical problems , the problems that will plague the government until it fixes them .
when the Board of Internal Economy meets , its members present the positions of their parties and members but do not speak or represent each and every member of the House .
i want to remind members of the Reform Party of something and point out the word consultation .
we do not want to be looking at an agreement which has already been negotiated , where the government has put the Canadian public in a take - it - or - leave - it position .
i am in receipt of a notice of motion under Standing Order 52 from the hon. member for Winnipeg - Transcona .
i am having a difficult time hearing the questions and answers .
ALGERIA
there was a Liberal party line and they toed it .
they understood that as long as interest payments were a significant amount in each budget , it was impossible for government to provide to the people of Canada value for their tax dollars .
why is he ignoring the National Assembly ' s unanimous vote ?
what he fails to mention is that his government is ripping $ 3,000 more from every average Canadian family in taxes than Mulroney did .
Mr. Speaker , they are at it again over here .
i noticed with great interest only a few days ago that the hon. member from the Bloc spoke about cuts to government funding and services .
if governments are to achieve international development goals such as world food security and sustainable development we must support the contribution of women and their full participation in agricultural and rural development .
this is what Canadians have asked the government for , to ensure that their Canada pension plan will be there in the future .
war CRIMINALS
Mr. David Pratt
the Speaker
( 3 ) to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage
i am not particularly interested in all that .
Mr. Nelson Riis
( m ) National Defence and Veterans Affairs ( sixteen Members ) ;
Mr. Speaker , it is a great honour to address you in this House for the first time .
the Minister of Finance cut $ 4.5 billion from federal transfers to the provinces for education , health and social assistance .
we listen to what our colleague from British Columbia in the other House has been saying about this country .
as for the part of the speech entitled " Building Safer Communities '' , it hides another attempt by the federal government to encroach on areas of provincial jurisdiction .
this will be welcomed by families in my riding .
it includes , for instance , the first Acadians in a New Democratic caucus as well as an aboriginal member from the Prairies .
certainly this might be a fact that could be considered by our Minister of Finance .
government GRANTS
* * *
there are much better ways to rescue the plan than simply throwing more money at it and in doing so destroying the economy of the country by destroying a lot of small businesses .
you have heard the terms of the request .
firearms ACT
why don ' t my hon. friends start with the same kind of leadership by example ?
but what did the Minister of Finance do ?
the right wing Neanderthals of the Reform Party say one thing and practise something else .
i am working with some of my community colleges to ensure they can access these funds to build their programs .
it could start by assuring this House that it will respect the output of the public consultations the premiers are initiating in their provinces even if it does not agree with all the points that are raised .
an hon. member :
hon. Paul Martin
speech after speech , and budget after budget gives us these useless , meaningless words , backed up by absolutely nothing , except a measure announced a few days ago , $ 90 million for an internship program for 3,000 young Canadians .
Mr. Yvan Loubier
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
originally , the code was supposed to restore the government ' s integrity and image .
if Stanley had been around he would probably have had another arrowroot biscuit and a cup of tea in quiet celebration of the fact .
Mr. Speaker , schizophrenia is a devastating disease that affects one out of every hundred Canadians .
many colleagues on the opposition side as well as on the government side have experienced this situation .
what confuses me in this whole process is in the last number of days we have had questions thrown at the ministers in advance .
Mr. Nelson Riis
government is destroying the wheat board .
government members will have to answer those questions .
these fallacies of theirs are obstacles that prevent this scientific theory from becoming a scientific law .
all the while we are maintaining our steady attack on both the deficit and the debt .
rather , it is important to remind the public , and ourselves , of the federal government ' s mandate and role regarding official languages minorities across the country , that is to say in all the provinces except Quebec for the French speaking minority , and in Quebec for the
* * *
the reality is that over the years this was a situation that we allowed to happen .
today I put the same question that his leader asked on April 1 , 1993 . Will the government commit today to a universal national drug -
that is why we have not forgotten the farmers .
that the amendment be modified by adding after the words " legislative program " the following :
we have put proposals in the House that address the issues of today and not of yesterday .
Mr. Lynn Myers
you were in the government at that time .
i encourage the federal government , as I will encourage my riding , to take these types of proactive steps .
Mr. Bob Mills
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
had we done so , nobody would have believed us and we would not have been re - elected with a majority , as we were on June 2 .
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia ) :
the purpose of this bill is to ban the cloning of human embryos .
we must not forget jobs , jobs , jobs .
yesterday , their leader tabled an amendment which basically says : let us stop considering the bill .
Mr. Speaker , this is the first time I have had the opportunity to speak in this new Parliament .
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
the Deputy Speaker :
let me pose a question to him .
would the hon. member like to comment ?
that will also be a concern .
they think it is their God given right to tax it out of people ' s pockets .
despite that $ 10 billion when people retire they will still only get a pension of $ 8,800 .
i would like to point out the wording in the Canadian Wheat Board Act what we proposed directly follows the Canadian Business Incorporations Act and nothing more .
these negotiations have been ongoing for two years in Paris , in the context of the OECD .
it is obvious .
while in his first speech his heart went out to the anglophone community , he is now bothered that , under a charter of rights and with the support of a large majority of Quebeckers , a support which they have expressed in one poll after the other , the use of English on commercial signs has been allowed .
it seems this would be something that I would hope parliamentarians would do without instruction .
* * *
when disability benefits are converted into retirement pensions at age 65 in the future , they will be based on the year ' s maximum pensionable earnings at the time of disablement with subsequent price indexing rather than on the YMPE at age 65 .
we visited Winnipeg , Regina , Saskatoon , Calgary and Grande Prairie .
it provides disability benefits to contributors who are no longer able to work for example .
it will be a great opportunity to work with my colleagues , to respect the wishes of farmers and to strengthen , not tear down , the Canadian Wheat Board .
i rise to address the throne speech delivered on Tuesday by the governor general .
that is the great initiative of this Liberal government .
throne SPEECH
when I look back and read the first speech I ever made in this House , I could say most of the same things today .
contrary to erroneous assertions of some of the wheat board ' s more strident critics , like that gaggle of political drifters who make up the so - called Saskatchewan Party in my home province , neither the CWB nor the government will retain any power to fire any elected director .
how will they vote ?
irresponsible comments like these can undermine our foreign policy legitimacy .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak this morning on Bill C - 4 , formerly C - 72 .
i unquestionably defy anyone who expounds the survival of the fittest model of living .
immediately I got wind of the allegations in March , I turned to my officials and asked my deputy minister to assure me that the entire consultation process , a very broad and open process involving several stakeholders , such as the Government of Quebec , Ms. Harel , and government opposition members , as you know , in every riding across Canada , including those in Quebec , was fine .
our support for the Calgary declaration as a starting point on unity discussions was based on the total package , not just one item out of seven .
the Deputy Speaker :
has he not looked at any of the very serious arguments put forward by credible organizations such as those I have listed ?
he also stated the very obvious , in particular to those of us from Atlantic Canada , that there are very few jobs and employment opportunities in the hundreds of rural communities in Atlantic Canada .
if we keep saying that business is bad and everyone else is good -
the selection of R & D projects will be the responsibility of the Canadian Foundation for Innovation , which may , if necessary , resort to peer evaluation .
for over 25 years I grew up in a group home with over 400 children from across the country who were runaways , who were abused , from every aspect of life .
the problem with a debt that big is it has to be serviced .
if the member will give me a moment I will count .
* * *
as a result we have made a fundamental change in the way herbal remedies and natural products will be regulated .
so the link has been made .
building Safer Communities
unfortunately that did not happen .
if they do , I promise that I will not try and roast them by saying they were wrong .
there are $ 939 missing from the Bloc Quebecois figures .
i would say not .
first we want our politicians to be honest .
we know how easy it is to travel on a Canadian passport .
health CARE
we will continue in a wide variety of ways to promote and protect the health and safety of Canadians .
if it took its responsibilities seriously , the federal government might reform personal income tax to make it more equitable .
we will reduce the debt .
as long as we do not have an act similar to the one which exists in Quebec , we will have situations like the present one where there are allegations of influence peddling on behalf of the Liberal Party of Canada and maybe the office of the President of Treasury Board , someone of some importance within the government .
Mr. John Duncan
my officials confirmed to me that the process was transparent .
the consultation process was very extensive .
governments around the world are doing that .
we could well see that type of thing again .
to their families I express not only my compassion for their grief , but also my assurance to do everything possible to guarantee that all future blood supplies are safe .
the investment board will keep Canadians well informed of its policies , operations and investment results in the following ways : making its investment policies , standards and procedures public , releasing quarterly financial statements , publishing an annual report , and holding regular meetings in each province to allow for public discussion and input .
job creation and economic growth are and will remain our first priorities .
* * *
i want to talk about the Ontario teachers pension plan and other major pension plans in the country .
we have young pages sitting here .
our young people are enterprising , well educated and ready to take over from us and contribute to the development of Canada .
these include aboriginal communities .
i heard nothing about sustainability .
they fail to remember that part of history where farmers were having a very difficult struggle in this country to make ends meet but we will see what happens down the road .
No.
those are the mathematics which are in place now .
that is something .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
i for one do not believe it works all the time .
this is my favourite one .
Mr. Ken Epp :
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
Mr. Speaker , all parties in the House with one exception have never been as united for Canadian unity than they are now with nine of the premiers .
they had 16 hours notice to examine that term before the advanced polls opened .
* * *
Mr. Roy Cullen :
it is from Toronto Star columnist David Crane and reads :
i urge all Canadians to join me in doing whatever we can to preserve the best country and the best nation in the world .
that will be the day when we do not have to borrow to cover the cost of federal spending and debt charges .
i would like to know whether it is the same for other departments .
Mr. Andr 茅 Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) :
i would like her to put that in my hands following these procedures today .
Mr. Speaker , I think young Quebeckers are joining the legitimate march of the people of Quebec in the course of their history .
Mr. Derek Lee :
it is a nation in which citizens have access to the skills and knowledge they need to benefit from Canada ' s rapidly changing knowledge and information infrastructure .
sometimes , it is the most difficult of times that show what it is that unites a community .
the plant has even produced rail cars for places as far away as Ankara , Turkey .
British Columbians are crying out for federal leadership and this government is failing them miserably .
i would caution him against wishing that I be here too often and remind him of the old Chinese proverb that he may end up getting what he wishes for .
Mr. Hubert Kleysen , who lives in my riding , has a trucking firm .
my sense of responsibility , as I make my first speech in the House of Commons , also comes from those who came before me , those who made a difference in the lives of people in my constituency and indeed everywhere in this country .
the factory is a historic one and it is very important to the community that this serious problem be discussed .
a new Cool Climate Oenology and Viticulture Institute is being sponsored by a government and industry partnership and will be officially opened at Brock University next month .
as well , 20 percent of additional quotas are sold from individual fishers to the corporations .
all benefits under the CPP , except the death benefit , would remain fully indexed to inflation .
Mr. Peter Adams
it will make it more difficult for people with serious disabilities to qualify for the Canada pension .
i ask the government to stop punishing Canadians who have worked and saved for their retirement and urge them to put the seniors benefit on hold until there are full consultations on the proposed plan .
Mr. Speaker , we are not talking about the current investigation .
but we need to put our collective energies into how governments can support sustainable practices given the self - policing concepts of profit and competition inherent in free markets .
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) :
other than that I thought the leader of the Reform Party made an excellent speech yesterday .
then we are wrong footed .
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
co - OPERATIVES
i would like to know from this minister whether , in awarding contracts , project by project , file by file , his procedure is as his colleague at human resources development has indicated , to transmit the lists to the President of Treasury Board , to the minister responsible for the Quebec region ?
it would be costly , it would take a lot of time , and it would mean that resources would be devoted to an inquiry and legal costs instead of to science in the fisheries itself .
contents
i know Herb served this House very well in the one term he was here .
they do nothing to offer CPP premiums with tax cuts and do not encourage greater RRSP savings .
list referred to above is as follows : ]
as issues come forward and develop the consultation and the input of Canadians will be reflected in future legislation .
that is where we run into trouble .
Beauchesne ' s citation No. 877 ( 2 ) goes further to state that " the publication of proceedings of committees conducted with closed doors or of reports of committees before they are available to members will constitute a breach of privilege '' .
* * *
what is this for ?
in a self - directed RRSP would the average Canadian citizen have to sit there at night and work over all the numbers or hire some investment counsellor ?
the minister also proposed the establishment of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to increase the plan ' s rate of return .
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond - Guiral
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
[ editor ' s Note :
i do not know anybody who is recommending that formula for gender balance .
appendix
health PROTECTION BRANCH
i do want to sincerely extend best wishes to the new minister of agriculture who was here a little bit earlier and his elevation to cabinet .
i congratulate the member on her election .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
once again he is putting his own interests before those of the Quebec people .
i think it is pretty scary .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
speech FROM THE THRONE
the perception is that it is a riding with high average incomes .
he was very clear about it :
in his response to the Speech from the Throne , the Prime Minister kept for himself the announcement of new meddling in areas of provincial jurisdiction .
what an amazing coincidence .
they were not worth the powder to blow them up .
there are centres for excellence to advance our understanding of the needs of children , the millennium scholarship endowment fund to help students secure a post - secondary education , an extension of the internship program to give youth needed work experience , enhanced funding for student summer placement , and a Canada - wide mentorship program .
we recognize that parents , governments , the private sector and community based organizations must work together to ensure that our children develop properly .
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , or shall I say the compulsory wheat board .
Mr. Speaker , again I would like to raise the same issue we have been talking about , the seriousness of the passport problem we have had .
we are a very decent nation , capable of understanding , compromise and diplomacy .
* * *
it speaks exactly to the needs of producers and to consumers who enjoy the agricultural industry .
we are back at it again in this Chamber even though over the last number of months in my province approximately 54,000 or 55,000 people voted to retain their rights in education and to keep their 28,000 children in their particular school systems .
when we hear about the undemocratic process that has been suggested with regard to the wheat board , there is no question that we need to have a balance between those who are responsible for the expertise in that legislation and those who really represent the sale by the farmers .
instead of redistributing the surplus to the provinces , which were hit hard with cuts during the Liberal government ' s first term of office , this government is getting ready to ignore completely its so - called partners , the provinces , and hand this money over to citizens directly , with no regard for real needs in health and education , particularly in Quebec .
there were very few representatives of the younger generation of Canadians welcomed at those panels .
we are changing the same clause of the Constitution of Canada twice in the space of one year .
did he , in the time between question period yesterday and today , discuss this matter with not some but many of his colleagues , since almost everyone in cabinet knew about it but him ?
Mr. Speaker , let us put a few facts on the table .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for Wetaskiwin for seconding the bill .
i ask that question .
we intend to provide annual statements to all contributors as soon as it is feasible .
why does he not investigate these allegations independent of the commission that is looking at his affidavit ?
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) :
one must consider the following points with respect to the proposed amendments .
i have the honour to lay upon the table a reprinted copy of the Standing Orders of the House of Commons dated June 1997 .
over the last four years we have been getting Canadians connected and putting them on the information highway .
i extend best wishes to you on behalf of the members of the official opposition .
the Privy Council in the case of Kielley v. Carson in 1842 when ruling on a question of privilege noted that members of the legislative body enjoy these privileges because the legislature cannot act or perform without the unimpeded use of the services of its members .
Mr. Speaker , Reformers believe that any surpluses belong to Canadians and they are really demanding accountability .
the single most important commitment of the Government is to keep Canada united .
it will be more accountable .
bill C - 7 .
i remember travelling with my family from what was then a relatively provincial Toronto to the sophisticated city of Montreal to see that great city for the first time and to wonder at Man and his World exposition and to ride on the metro .
Mr. Robert Bertrand ( Pontiac - Gatineau - Labelle , Lib . ) :
there must have been something great in creating a country of such immense promise .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
the argument was not fully developed by the hon. member for Calgary Southwest .
the legislation that will be introduced to implement the proposed changes to the Canada Pension Plan and the non - taxable seniors benefit will , I believe , ensure that our public pension system will remain sustainable for generations to come .
this is what the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , as well as Quebec ' s Chamber of Commerce and Conseil du patronat , are asking for .
i call on the government to reverse the cuts and reinvest in health care until such time as the system addresses all the health care needs of my constituents and all Canadians .
i am going to be with that voice to make sure the Minister of Finance keeps his commitment that was stated during the election .
i don ' t think you can move that on a point of order .
these voices will urge him to protect our industries from the cut and thrust of foreign competition .
it is a closed fund .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
Ms. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) :
we in the NDP believe the regulations which govern party financing in Canada are like hunting dogs that will not hunt .
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) :
i must point out that , in this area , there is a particular threat to specialized French language periodicals , given their limited market .
notwithstanding the fact that the Canada pension plan until this point in time has not had the flexibility that other pension plans would be permitted , the pension plan has still yielded an average of about 10 % which is not good enough .
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner :
the Speaker
will the minister step outside the House and apologize to Mr. Coffey for calling him a liar , for calling into question the integrity of this 25 year veteran of the department ?
it is high time that we got to the bottom of it .
how did the NDP vote on the MP pension plan ?
hon. Herb Gray
grain TRANSPORTATION
Mr. Jim Gouk
speech FROM THE THRONE
what is to be done with them ?
it makes it possible for community groups to provide services locally .
we desperately need to dismantle our internal trade barriers and lower payroll and other taxes .
it is a defined benefit plan and pays out around $ 17 billion per year in benefits to Canadians , including the pension benefits , survivors benefits and disability benefits .
in fact about 30 years of benefits would have to be in place , which is a very substantial amount of money , and that cannot happen very quickly .
for example , does a child tax credit go under the tax relief column or the children ' s program column ?
we live in a very wealthy country .
we do not believe since Charlottetown or since Meech Lake that any major constitutional amendment should be passed without public ratification through a referendum .
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to be in this hallowed House participating in this debate .
madam Speaker , may I say to the leader of the official opposition that calm is to my party what openmindedness is to his .
our plan is exactly the kind of preventive action that Canadians demand from their governments to avert future crisis in the Canada pension plan .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
a young Canadian with a job has a foothold in the labour market and is better able to contribute to the economic and social fabric of his or her community .
Mr. Speaker , you are quite right .
Mr. Speaker , I have their feeble excuse for accessing this file too .
i look forward very much to working for my constituents in the upcoming mandate .
i do not think a long concerted effort to try to save this country is boring .
one of my most distinguished predecessors from South Shore came to this Parliament in 1957 .
does the member for Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac , in her great wisdom and as an Acadian representative , share her colleague ' s opinion , or does she recognize the existence of a Quebec people ?
Mr. John Maloney
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner
Mr. Speaker , earlier this month one of the justices of the Supreme Court of Canada announced that he was retiring .
but I think one big reason we have had that sustained unemployment rate in Canada is a lack of vision on the part of the government .
the 25 th anniversary of the Summit Series sparked a flood of reminiscence .
the Speaker :
in a secret memo to John Sims , the Assistant Deputy Attorney General , dated December 14 , 1995 , Chris Amerasinghe states this :
when we are giving tributes , and I know that you , Sir , have brought this matter to our attention before , I think we should all sit and show respect for the families of those to whom we are paying tribute .
the hon. secretary of state .
given the substantial changes in our demographics , a much higher than anticipated ratio of retirees to worker and the longer life expectancy , I believe we found the best possible solution .
the Bloc Quebecois says no .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy
this has put extra pressure on provincial governments , health care institutions , health care providers and , most of all , patients and their families .
at this point , unless I have more direction from the entire House and in view of the fact that Speakers have consistently ruled since 1968 that they would not intervene in the quality of whatever discussions took place on either matter , I am left to decide this on what is in the standing orders .
we knew we had to put the plan on a sound financial footing .
new rules of calculation will apply to combined benefits for those who are collecting both a disability and a survivor ' s pension , or retirement benefits and a survivor ' s pension .
last , I remember her saying clearly that she was going to deal with victim rights .
i would like to ask her a question , because it is all very well to talk of the economy , but I think the most important thing is simply to reach a common understanding .
for instance , $ 33,800 was granted to examine major league baseball in Detroit .
Ms. Val Meredith :
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the hon. member from the Liberal Party talk about how the Liberal Party should be getting a lot of praise and pats on the back for finally doing something right after the last 30 years .
tickets cost $ 100 , including $ 35 for the dinner and $ 65 for the contribution .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
this ensures that all farmers benefit equally regardless of when their grain is sold during the crop year .
my bill would force those who write the bills to construct them in plain language .
for the next four years we are going to drill it and drill it and drill it again until the public finally gets enough and says that it is time the Liberals were put out of office .
it is one of the primary reasons why I chose to run in the recent election for Reform .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
i think the remarks the Chair heard were not of the kind described and as the hon. member is suggesting .
we must all be sensitive to the problems workers are experiencing and this will be one of the mandates that I will be fulfilling in this House .
if the member has any evidence to the contrary other than allegations , he should table them in the House .
the prayers of my friends and colleagues here are with Sharon , her family and her husband .
we just took in the money and spent it .
Mr. Speaker , I think the hon. member puts his finger on two of the big problems that we have to address in Canada .
people learn .
Ms. Alexa McDonough
i will not say " my friends " because I do not want my constituents to hate me , but the government opposite would be the first , following telephone calls , probably from all the financiers in the world , to want to negotiate with a sovereign Quebec .
speech FROM THE THRONE
there is no reason to accuse the federal government of interfering in an area of provincial jurisdiction .
in fact it addresses the very issue .
Mr. Yvan Loubier : - but maintains privileges -
and that is not because they always support what is being put in front of them , but because the consequences of voting against the government are so serious .
many of the members of this assembly can trace their heritage to a common path .
that is the main thrust of the argument I am making .
the Presiding Officer : ( Mr. Caccia ) :
Mr. Preston Manning
i would just make one correction to what my colleague said , and I will be doing this often .
there was an arbitrator , Mr. Justice Gold , who asked the government to pay the bills which were submitted by the lawyers and the public relations people working for Mr. Mulroney .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
the commissioner is not independent , since he is appointed by the Prime Minister , advises the Prime Minister on the sly , on a confidential basis , and has no say in decisions .
one of the major successes of the quiet revolution in Quebec has been the creation of the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement .
the Minister of National Revenue says that they want more facts .
we invest more money in our youth programs as well .
we have continued funding for summer jobs up to $ 120 million this year which meant an additional 30,000 jobs for students .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
i emphasize and hope for concurrence from the official opposition that any change to the Canada pension plan that needs to be considered will only be considered so that an increase in the steady rate of 9.9 percent will not be required .
Mr. Rick Casson
the sections of the throne speech which refer to investing in children are particularly important .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie :
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy :
i think it is probably a good thing that he did .
the treaty to be signed here in Ottawa will serve as a fitting tribute to her legacy and her memory .
an older population does not mean we must adopt an individualized approach or that we must privatize our public pension system .
my question to the hon. member , which I hope she will answer , is this :
this bill attempts to harmonize the CPP disability benefits with provincial workers compensation benefits and various other benefits , including those received from municipalities and private insurers .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur
we too had to deal with that deficit , and , had the Conservative government not introduced free trade , we would not be where we are today .
ATLANTIC GROUNDFISH STRATEGY
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
Mr. Peter MacKay
for those who are interested , the real story is that all the measures to reduce spending put forward by the former government were shot down by the Liberals now in power .
Mr. Ghislain Fournier ( Manicouagan , BQ ) :
the first point that I would like to make is that whatever the circumstances , CPP will be there for Canadians when they need it .
fear not : it is not out of generosity that the Liberal government came up with this legislation but , rather , because of pressure exerted by western producers , who have been demanding that changes be made to the methods used by the Canadian Wheat Board .
in fact they are in most cases connected with families , many of them in desperate straits .
while we recognize there is a great deal to be done , it is the beginning of a voyage toward economic recovery .
i am going to push very strongly to see that there are some changes made along the lines of final offer selection arbitration .
we are the first industrialized country faced with these changing demographics to address this problem with such courage .
this is very interesting .
the lady said that there was no intervention and no intention of intervening and that the question was purely hypothetical .
we are grateful for their support and we recognize that we are not unique .
federation OF CANADIAN MUNICIPALITIES
the Speaker :
i want to first thank the voters of Qu ' Appelle for electing me as their member of Parliament .
Mr. Jerry Pickard
he went on to say that Tremblant would have a long history that would go well beyond the political history of the region .
i find it strange that the hon. leader of the New Democratic Party would believe in a principle that would allow other governments the right to attend all committee hearings of the House of Commons and Senate .
i was interested about the role of a member of Parliament .
in the last Parliament a tremendous challenge was facing us with the deficit at record levels .
it does not provide benefits for children .
with respect to candidates , the reimbursement provided is 50 % of the candidate ' s expenditures , providing that the candidate receives at least 15 % of the votes .
how did we get into this fix ?
hon. Don Boudria
i want constituents of my riding and of my colleagues ' ridings to know that when we come to this place we will vote in favour of measures and bills which support a platform on which we ran .
Mr. Dennis J . Mills :
in this context , the Minister responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development made a wonderful announcement last week " We are going to invest in employment and partnership for young people , in community futures development corporations , to set up a program to help people start a business , and to hire youth advisers '' .
in fact , of the five party leaders in the House , I am the only one that actually grew up on a farm .
we have already begun on a number of these .
Mr. Speaker , I would just like to pick up on what my colleague , the member for Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , was saying .
also , this morning ' s press summary shows that there are already people in English Canada who are openly saying that too much is being offered in the Calgary proposal .
Mr. Lee Morrison
he believed , as did those of his generation , that Canada was worth protecting and that Canada and our way of life was worth saving .
the House has heard the proposal of the chief government whip .
i do not believe that she even believes that particular answer .
when the hon. member ' s private member ' s bill comes forward we will examine it with great seriousness and sensitivity to ensure the common goals that we have , are supported in the House .
i speak for a party committed to a political process which reflects the views and interests of regular Canadians rather than the political elites , a party whose principles and policies are formulated at the constituency level and must be approved by the membership , a party that publishes its principles and policies called the blue book for all to read and to consider .
we respect the process .
if the government truly wants to reflect social and linguistic diversity , it should stop censoring artistic projects that deal with the history or culture of Quebec , as it did with Pierre Falardeau ' s plans for a film about the life of the Patriot Delorimier , entitled Le 15 f 茅 vrier 1839 .
it seems to me that in a country as rich as ours we should not have the number of children living in poverty and suffering today because their parents are living in poverty .
for the average Canadian worker that amounts to $ 400 a year in overpayments .
statements BY MEMBERS
we do not understand the minister ' s undue haste .
* * *
it is as though he put up a sign saying :
was the Minister of Public Works , who is responsible for the Quebec wing of the Liberal Party , informed by his -
Mr. Rob Anders
we had to deal with the deficit .
the Speaker :
i find it very shameful .
i will take the information under advisement and I will study it .
to us it is simply scandalous that this goes on and on .
the Speaker :
as a next step , the First Ministers will meet this fall to work on co - operative approaches to address youth unemployment , health care and social policy renewal .
we have been told about the procedure for one department .
what is the role of each province in the Constitution ?
hear , hear .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
it was the member for Surrey Central who made that statement .
consideration resumed of motion
in 1950 , during the opening speech at the federal - provincial constitutional conference - because that is the second national sport in Canada - Maurice Duplessis said : " Canadian confederation is a pact of union between two great nations '' .
Mr. Jobin deliberately misled and deliberately withheld the information from me .
what is he talking about ?
trade
the tenets of the Canada Health Act presumed high quality care .
in Quebec , 49.4 percent of the people voted yes , and the member was sufficiently impressed by that percentage that he decided to come to the House to debate the question , just like us .
we have to plan .
no longer will critics say that Canadian federalism does not work .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member can use any words he chooses .
i will not ask the House just to believe what I think .
there are few examples of federations in the world - and the hon. member sitting next to me is an expert on these issues - where one nation clearly has control over a territory , as is the case in Quebec .
we do not deny that .
Mr. Speaker , I rise today so that the House and its members might pay tribute to the life and memory of Mother Teresa .
but it is obviously up to the Minister of Human Resources Development to review the procedures in his department and I think that , with his integrity and good judgement , he has the matter under review .
our plan during the election set out our values and priorities , a growing economy , a modernized health care system and investing in knowledge to equip Canadians to compete in a changing world .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye
and this is the open door to all excesses , a slide towards anger and intolerance , towards totally anti - democratic behaviour .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
it is a bittersweet celebration for us today .
there will also be changes to the Canadian Wheat Board ' s marketing mandate and greater empowerment for farmers .
that this House condemns the attitude of the government , which refuses to introduce in - depth reform of the legislation on the financing of federal political parties even though the existing legislation allows for a wide range of abuses .
a major difference - and I want to say a word about it - concerns the appointment of the president .
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I ask that all notices of motions for the production of papers be allowed to stand .
it is an issue which concerns a great many Canadians with respect to sovereignty and the ability of governments to act in the public interest and the increasing restrictions on that ability of governments to act in the public interest and in the common good .
trade
the province of Nova Scotia chose to use a public - private partnership concept as a means to construct and finance highway 104 .
why did he wait until the matter became a subject of public interest in the media before he notified the House of what was happening within his department ?
a country that invests in its children successfully will have a better future .
agreed .
the Speaker :
yet the Reform Party members are silent on the issue .
that is fundamentally what we in the Reform Party are fighting for .
would the member tell us how not cutting taxes will attract researchers to this country ?
he publicly called on the Liberal government to select his replacement through an open review process .
the Deputy Speaker :
let us give a hand for the teachers across Canada and around the world for the work they do .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
Ron did contact foreign affairs , both over there and here in Ottawa .
Mr. Lynn Myers
Mr. Speaker , the Canada pension plan disability program has an appeal process .
would the member identify any initiative of this government to first make sure there are democratic processes in place to make sure this money she is talking about will truly get down to the end user instead of being given once again to people who perhaps are incapable of managing or who improperly manage the money ?
it was front and centre in 1949 when we joined Confederation with Canada .
Michel Bastarache ' s appointment is one of the worst the government opposite has made .
over the past couple of days I have heard my Reform colleagues consistently speak of open reform , public involvement , let the people make the decisions , referendum , referendum , referendum .
Mr. Speaker , the member ' s question is very important .
the majority of New Democratic Party members have not had an occasion to speak once on the bill , never mind three times .
the fact of the matter is that our amendment in and of itself is debatable , and that is what we want to do in the House .
i can just imagine the Minister of Public Works and Governmental Services explaining during the election campaign that his government ' s code of ethics is different from that of the Liberal Party of Canada .
in the Speech from the Throne we have again committed the government to continuing to reduce the barriers to post - secondary education .
he will also know , as industry minister in the last Parliament , that during the time that cabinet sat there were probably in the neighbourhood of half a dozen serious decisions involving the CRTC which cabinet looked at , many of which were overturned .
families have been undergoing diminished disposable income for the past 15 years .
they are ashamed of themselves .
we are experiencing healthy growth in investment , and hence in the number of potential partners in research and development .
when they understood through our campaign that we were committed to securing the Canada pension plan for the future and that we were developing the seniors benefit plan , they knew that the government would be watching out for them .
that commitment is to work hard to maintain and enhance what we believe to be the best place in Canada , and that means the world .
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
one of them is health care .
she continued to express some very grave concerns about inadequate testing of drugs which Canadians use daily .
i can give members a couple of examples from this poll .
some day , the member will have to answer for his actions and I can assure you that his constituents will know the truth and I will condemn this double talk .
seasonal work is important in Atlantic Canada but misunderstood by the Liberal government .
on June 2 Canadians voted for success .
they believe that massive job creation programs are the solution to the perpetual levels of high unemployment in this country .
Mr. Speaker , the opposition should commend the government for having had the courage to undertake a difficult but necessary reform to make our employment system responsive to modern market conditions .
they were offered two tier medicine and they declined .
Mr. Speaker , I definitely had a duty to do so .
this activity benefits northern communities by creating jobs for our population .
for me the sustainability of the health care system is reliant upon the recognition of all the determinants of health : jobs and poverty , violence and crime prevention , the environment .
he knows that .
while the self - sufficiency of the Canadian Wheat Board would increase , the government would still have an important role to play in supporting it .
canada PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT
last year alone $ 310 million were raised and spent in communities across this country while three million hours of work were put in by volunteers and members of this great organization .
when we consider the risks involved , the headaches and the aggravation of owning a small or medium size business , we have to wonder if wise choices are being made out there .
i ask the Minister of Health to answer that question .
just vote for us '' .
the young people graduating from high school have lost all hope in post - secondary education .
i do not find anything more reprehensible than that .
if he wants us to send something we will consider it , but before sending it I would like to see exactly what is happening in the provinces as they consult before deciding .
some hon. members :
the Liberals also promised the CPP would never climb above 5 % contributions , but lo and behold they are talking about 9.9 % as though it was nothing .
division No. 9
he should realize that .
we are also still waiting for the implementation of a true shipbuilding policy , as promised by the Liberals four years ago .
when we return home we also say how great it is to be home , even though we have visited some exotic places .
decorum in House
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
we in the Bloc Quebecois are going to fight to put a stop to this sinister plan by the Liberal government .
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
Canadians believe that we can and must do better .
some hon. members :
Mr. Speaker , this is my first time speaking on a bill in the House since the election .
Mr. Speaker , I know the hon. member is a better doctor than he is a mathematician .
producers are sick and tired of hearing who is to blame for the grain delays of last winter .
i want to make reference to a concept we have not heard a lot about but will hear more about , the concept of intergenerational equity .
Mr. John Richardson ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
he complains that we only brought forward the reforms in 1997 when they were due in 1996 .
the first example is the Canada pension plan changes in Bill C - 2 which is at second reading and will go to the Standing Committee on Finance .
one may wonder why the minister , who claims to be waiting for the SQDM ' s opinion before going ahead , gave his approval prior to receiving it .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur
it is situated on the shores of Lake Simcoe and enjoys all the amenities that top recreational facilities and dynamic economic growth provide .
that being said , we take very seriously all cases of persons suspected of contemporary war crimes who try to enter this country .
radar VETERANS REUNION
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
they are competing with the world ' s best and they are winning .
i mention this because there are those who look at the books of Canada , at spending , and are surprised to find that even if we held the line on spending in all departments on an annual basis it would still increase to the tune of about - if I remember correctly and I am quoting from memory - $ 2 billion a year .
the government will help strike partnerships between governments , communities and people in celebration of the new millennium .
case closed .
i would not be standing here today if that act had not been repealed .
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) :
the Speaker :
nay .
the Deputy Speaker :
in turn I have kept the ministers and the prime minister involved .
i guess that is another point that could be discussed at some further time .
* * *
our hearts go out to them .
it makes it very difficult for businesses to compete .
criminal CODE
Canadians also have a sense of fairness .
this is what we call the new economy .
some hon. members :
we on this side of the House want to see aboriginal communities become stronger and healthier .
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Human Resources Development is telling us how his department operates and that the minister responsible for the Quebec region is consulted by the Department of Human Resources Development .
our electoral system has been imitated elsewhere .
in addition to the pension portions there are important insurance components of the CPP .
since June 2 , the voters in Bourassa have , for the first time in four years , a real member of Parliament , a true federalist voice in the House of Commons , a good representative who will fight to protect their interests and express their viewpoints in Parliament .
Canadians obviously have recognized the absolute necessity of connecting with the bigger world outside of Canada for the purposes of keeping our economy strong and prosperous .
a Reform Party member is now starting to intervene by saying that it would be a better return .
members will have noted that there are now a number of bills on the Order Paper .
Monday , September 29 , 1997
mayor Edwards has a long and distinguished career in public service spanning five decades .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for Kamloops for backing up so many of the concerns of the Reform Party .
introduction and first reading
what I am asking of you is to uphold my rights as a member of this House and not my interests as a member of a particular political party which we know is reflected in the composition of the Board of Internal Economy .
hopefully we will not be indulging in this vituperative political rhetoric but I guess they will persist .
the riding of Leeds - Grenville is a dynamic mix of agriculture , business , industry , the service sector and with the support of an efficient CTC and the efforts of enlightened entrepreneurs is fast becoming a tourist destination for the world .
there needs to be debate .
i know all members will join with me in honouring the Whitby Warriors as the Junior A champions in Canada ' s national summer sport .
on the Speech from the Throne Tim Reid , president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce , said :
it is a time when we should all pause to reflect on the contribution of our police and peace officers , who they are and what they make as a contribution to our Canadian society .
then a vote on the inclusion by the producers of that grain would also have to be held .
the Quebec Pension Plan recognizes this reality .
you do not have to ask anyone ' s permission .
i think the member , when talking about spending money , should focus on the program .
* * *
perhaps you Speaker could intervene .
in our election platform and again here in the House we talk about equality of opportunity for everyone .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
these guys are starting to make Brian Mulroney look like an amateur .
as I said yesterday in response to the question , the first I was aware of this was yesterday when the question was put .
i think the Leader of the Opposition is above making simplistic links .
the first thing we can do is to stabilize federal transfer levels at appropriate amounts .
i may remind him , however , that on both occasions , promises were made to the people of Quebec , and in both cases , these promises were not kept .
Mr. Grant McNally
this was even more deplorable than what we have been suggesting the last couple of days and asking questions about .
it is fine to go out there and accuse the provinces of doing this or that .
Mr. Robert D . Nault ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
the House met at 11 a.m.
Mr. Speaker , the provinces have used or will use all kinds of ways to consult their citizens , and I think the Canadian government has the right to consult Canadians throughout Canada .
Mr. Jean Dub 茅 :
in the House and in committee , Sharon Hayes was a tireless advocate for tax relief for families , protection for the unborn and the elderly , protection of the family from violence and state interference .
Mr. Claude Drouin
once more , Canadians are unwilling to pay 14 percent .
( members were issued ballots and marked their ballots in secret at voting stations )
fourth , the law should ensure that sentences reflect society ' s abhorrence for the criminal act in order to act as a true deterrent and to protect the public .
the Deputy Speaker :
i believe the time has come to proclaim our faith in their work and to declare two national holidays in their honour to recognize their contributions to Canada and to the building of our nation .
i appreciate and respect the time limits .
i encourage all Canadians to come and visit my riding and see the many splendours it has to offer .
there is absolutely no compassion for the most disadvantaged .
thanks to a rules based system and thanks to an independent way of breaking those log jams , not only has Canada been able to survive , but Canada has been able to win .
the House resumed consideration of the motion for an address to His Excellency the Governor General in reply to his speech at the opening of the session , of the amendment and of the amendment to the amendment .
when we consider the number of obstacles which stand in the way of a Canadian entrepreneur , the regulations and red tape , taxes , fees , licences at three levels of government , including all the agencies and commissions , the regulations and fees of the banks , the suppliers and the competition , it obviously takes a special breed of people to want to have their own business .
genetic engineering is evident with bovine growth hormone .
sometime after the meeting the hon. member ' s assistant contacted the DIAND regional office .
we are going to rob them of their jobs because of these payroll tax deductions .
as for the throne speech , the Prime Minister said it would probably be the last one before the celebrations marking the new millennium .
business OF THE HOUSE
these people either come back to do the work themselves or other people are doing the work for a lot less .
madam Speaker , it is with a great deal of respect that I take part in the debate on the throne speech .
the member for Saint John , for example , recommended that we should look in terms of maybe trying to reduce income tax as we increase Canada pension benefits .
i will ask one question of the hon. member across the way .
again , Mr. Speaker , this is an investigation in which no charges have been laid so far .
the bill also includes amendments to the CPP ' s financial provisions and changes the plan into an additional tax and a make - work project for bankers , who are good friends of the Liberals .
and of course it is assumed that all members in the House are always telling the truth .
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , this week is AIDS awareness week .
when all parties in the Quebec National Assembly say that they are taking a particular stand , it seems to me that this House should take notice .
rights of Parents
Mr. Randy White
it aims for the crystallization of federal , provincial and industry participation in the region ' s future development .
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) :
there is not a single serious jurist who would say that being unique had anything less to recommend it than being distinct .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
more important , what is the nature of the tax cut ?
my colleague , I am having a bit of trouble with the phrase " a deliberate attempt to bamboozle '' .
the people speak English , French , Ukrainian and Saulteaux .
the board , therefore , and the fund will be susceptible to political manipulation .
from the EI fund we are putting quite a lot of money into transitional job funding which is quite high in the regions where the levels of unemployment are higher .
Mr. Speaker , for clarification purposes , the bill is to prevent criminals from making profit from the proceeds of crime from the writing of stories or the making of films having to do with their exploits in crime .
indeed , the Asia Connects Youth Conference is one more measure of the government ' s commitment to our youth .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
we do not really know the readmission rate of people being sent home from hospital too early .
although a Conservative , Mr. MacRae was known as an ambassador of peace , mutual assistance between peoples , and equality .
as a result of his extensive background the minister understands that agriculture is the very foundation of this country and must be maintained no matter what countries or trade agreements try to threaten that foundation .
we know these motions are procedurally designed in such as way , whether a six - month hoist or whatever , and are often moved in order to create the possibility of more debate so that the government cannot move to the question on the main motion .
it is something we would all look forward to seeing a bit more of .
it is a farce and nothing more .
it is a very right wing conservative party .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
i received a letter from the Quebec transport minister inviting me to sit on a commission .
there are enough members over there to pass the thing , but I certainly hope they will find a lot of reasons to reflect on this over the coming weeks and probably come to another conclusion .
they were wide ranging and inclusive and provided Canadians the opportunity to have input into the priorities of this government .
the Canadian passport is a ticket to freedom .
it is unacceptable that our youth may know all about computers but so little about their country .
hon. Don Boudria
we are going to work to improve medicare in this country and make sure -
i sat here and said to myself " I am surrounded , surrounded by Progressive Conservatives '' .
encouraging more investment in Canada is one of the best ways to create jobs .
Mr. Speaker , we know that child poverty is a major issue and that it is a priority for all governments .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
on behalf of Bloc Quebecois members , I would therefore like to express our deepest condolences to his entire family and to tell them that we are keenly aware that there were lengthy periods during which they had to manage without Mr. Ellis , because he had to be here in Ottawa to serve his constituents .
it is interesting that he talks about the benefit of lower interest rates as though the Liberal government has brought them down on its own when in fact the government is capitalizing and taking advantage of the interest rates on a worldwide basis .
they elected me to do a job .
if Canada ratifies the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , greater incentives will exist for families to abdicate their parental responsibilities to the state .
in the Somalia inquiry not only was there interference , it stopped the inquiry completely .
perhaps he consulted with his leader ' s imaginary homeless friends because our aboriginal peoples consistently claim that they were not consulted , even though their treaty rights would be significantly affected .
it is important for the hon. member to note that Transport Canada ' s involvement in the highway 104 project ends right there .
for goodness ' sake , let us not amend the plan so that the lives of seniors will actually be made worse in the future .
on October 2 the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development made a statement to provide additional information on this question of privilege .
by giving increased powers to the province of Quebec in areas such as language , culture and education , are we not abandoning the anglophone minority of Quebec ?
the plan pays out a fully indexed pension to people 65 years and older .
can the prime minister advise whether the Department of Foreign Affairs has ever been approached directly or indirectly by foreign governments to provide Canadian passports to non - Canadian operatives ?
Mr. Carmen Provenzano
i appreciate very much his comments and look forward to working with him and reflecting the standard of integrity within this House and within our institutions of government that the people of Canada are demanding and have not been finding , particularly in the justice system , as clearly revealed by the Angus Reid poll of this past summer .
Mr. Peter Adams
you cannot provide Canadians with tax relief if you are spending the money instead of reducing it .
more services are being delivered to assist these people .
it will mean no loss of control over changes to the plan and permit adjustments should problems or unforeseen circumstances arise .
some hon. members :
the next question is on the amendment .
government ORDERS
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Vancouver Quadra , Lib . ) :
as a consequence , his merchandise was held in a sterile city warehouse while his business suffered .
will the solicitor general now confirm that Pierre Corbeil was a paid employee of the Liberal Party of Canada , contrary to the press release from the Liberal Party yesterday , and the duration of Mr. Corbeil ' s employment ?
these are the values of my party and they are the values that we will fight for in the coming Parliament , giving our children the best possible start in life , education and job opportunities for our young , decent pensions for our seniors , medicare for all and poverty for none , a healthy environment for future generations and strong safe thriving communities .
Mr. Carmen Provenzano :
housing
Mr. Jason Kenney :
as a matter of fact , I sent him a note requesting a copy of his remarks because it was such a good speech .
Mr. Myron Thompson
the response of the government has been that there is a problem .
* * *
madam Speaker , when I was at college , I took two courses on statistics .
unfortunately -
Mr. Speaker , during question period today the foreign affairs minister suggested that he had called my office any number of times to get the list of people we are talking about .
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron
i really like the clause which my leader quoted yesterday from the Manitoba Act which states " Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law or practice in the province at the union '' .
some hon. members :
we are in the forefront of great scientific discoveries , working with the largest telescope in Canada .
we don ' t hear them talk about their expenses and the contributions they received .
Mr. Gary Pillitteri ( Niagara Falls , Lib . ) :
all the objective elements are present so that the word " nations " can be used in the plural .
as well , on page 2021 of the Journals for that day we see on the motion to concur in the Senate government bill that the Reform Party voted in favour of the bill , once again telling us that the procedure is quite correct .
Mr. Gerry Byrne
its linguistic attributes , with anglophone and francophone populations , mark it as a particular spot in Canada .
the minister ' s statement was wrong and is wrong .
i know that it is different from other cultures , but many other cultures make this country the best .
i remember when he was passing himself off as the reincarnation of Jean - Claude Mal 茅 part , over the Mal 茅 part family ' s objections .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
i was particularly pleased to hear the reference in the throne speech to environmental technologies and the potential for growth and global leadership .
this government has made a very firm pledge to listen to the producers .
Mr. Speaker , Sharon Hayes was a good friend to me .
we have to keep working to improve democracy in our country and avoid taking part in a discussion like the one the Bloc Quebecois wants to hold today .
the theme of it would be right up there with " Death of a Salesman " in terms of human tragedy .
the Liberals tamed the deficit that so constrained government action just four years ago .
we should work with the premiers and the territorial leaders in bringing together those areas that can be worked on .
i want to hear from the government how it intends to involve the Canadian public .
as the former volunteer chair of one of Canada ' s foremost arts organizations I believe we must invest in programs , opportunities and partnerships which support our culture .
the Canadian conference of catholic bishops called those people the new marginals who are abandoned to themselves without any help from the government .
support the building of strong Aboriginal communities - communities that provide their members with better living standards and opportunities ; and
we still support this component of the remake of the CWB .
the less we express and show that , the more distant they feel .
i want to make it very clear - and I am grateful to the minister for pointing it out - that in no way will the right to religious teaching be marginalized or diminished when linguistic school boards are created .
but legislation to do any real good for our communities must have substance .
the sustained rate of unemployment is hurting us .
the last time I had the honour to be elected your Speaker I said that we are the political gladiators of Canada , and we are .
it is intended to send the signal that we will not tolerate the fraudulent use of Canadian passports .
however , he did not talk about additional spending in retraining programs by the federal government which Quebec enjoys , in literacy , internship and mentorship and student programs .
what did Parliament do when asked to act on these irregularities ?
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
with the 1985 amendment , this inequity is likely to be permanent unless the Constitution is changed again .
my question for the Prime Minister is in yesterday ' s throne speech why in the world was the equality of citizens and provinces deliberately left out ?
i can also assure him there is an Income Tax Act and we are supposed to follow that .
while maintaining its commitment to improve public finances , the government can now say it can once again respond to Canadians ' priorities without exceeding our means .
i know that I will get the chance in the House one of these days to get an explanation of democracy from that side of the House because I still have not found that it gibes with what the dictionary says .
what do we have to show for the free trade agreement ten years later ?
the Bloc Quebecois would today like to congratulate the men and women of Comit 茅 du 15 f 茅 vrier 1839 on their initiative and calls on all members of this House , regardless of their political allegiance , to make a contribution as a show of their commitment to freedom of expression .
we can count on our contributions earning a fair rate of return , and we can count on not unduly burdening our children and grandchildren because this generation has failed to deal now with the needs of the future .
let me say clearly to members of the opposition , to Canadians in the galleries and to Canadians watching TV that Canada ' s retirement income system remains at the top of the government ' s agenda .
if he thinks Canadian youth now are more literate than they were in the past , I would say he is betraying his academic origins .
the union is clearly waiting for its decision to know what the amount will be , what the methodology will be , what will have to be paid .
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
why did he insist on making this appointment without parliamentary review ?
Mr. Speaker , the Voisey ' s Bay nickel project has already produced $ 4.3 billion worth of investment and promises thousands of highly paid permanent jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of resource royalty revenue for Newfoundland and Labrador .
it is not normal because the province of Nova Scotia gave up control of the speed limits and fine amounts .
it is an honour for you and deserving of both you and this great institution .
* * *
on the contrary , our European friends offer good examples of societies with older populations that now have public pension plans .
i am very pleased to rise to reintroduce this bill .
absolutely not .
hon. David Kilgour
the House has heard the terms of the motion .
madam Speaker , I am honoured to have this opportunity to respond to the throne speech , but first let me take this opportunity to thank the voters of Surrey North for showing their confidence in me .
if it is necessary I will come back to the House .
i know a number of the members of the Bloc as we worked closely together on the HRD committee and the transport committee .
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 231 , an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act ( warning labels regarding the consumption of alcohol ) .
but let us come back to books and history .
Ms. Judi Longfield :
we should never , under any circumstances - perhaps that is too far to go .
no federal political party holds more grassroots , public political meetings in the west than Reform , meetings at which this subject has been discussed at length for years .
it is our intention to examine these issues over the course of the next two years .
the sums are really huge .
Erskine May ' s 20 th edition makes clear , at page 168 , that a breach of privilege in one parliament may indeed be punished by another .
the climate can be as harsh as he described it , but people in Palliser and throughout the prairies have used the tools of community and co - operation to overcome the obstacles of climate and distance .
i want to extend my best wishes and my congratulations as well -
the advocates of partition are the ones who are using exclusive terms and who are dangerous .
it just is not in there .
i would also like to offer thanks on their behalf to the man who defended them with vigour throughout the previous two mandates , Beno 卯 t Tremblay .
the people of Fundy - Royal , like all Canadians across the country , have made fiscal sacrifices in the name of deficit elimination .
if the member could have a very very brief response , please do so .
Quebecers regard it as a step in the right direction , but when asked if it is enough , of course they say it is not .
Mr. Speaker , I move :
they will also have the duty to act honestly and in good faith , exercising all reasonable care , diligence and skill .
post - Secondary Education
it has been approved for use in many countries of the world , including the United States , Australia , and Great Britain .
what happened ?
its friends like Brian Mulroney brought in high interest rates in Canada .
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) :
this is not correct .
however I am encouraged by this small step in the right direction .
the centre ' s director was very blunt on one point : if it were relocated in Saint - Antoine - des - Laurentides , the centre would lose all of its present high profile .
no it is not , it is $ 7,939 .
just this week she decided that a real choice had to be made and , consistent with her attachment to the supreme value of the family , she has chosen to devote all her time to Doug ' s support and recovery .
this situation is unique because three out of the five recognized parties in the House of Commons do not have representation in the other place .
the Speaker :
in the coming months we plan to work more closely with aboriginal communities to develop crime prevention initiatives .
it was to that end that , last week , the Prime Minister announced in this House the establishment of the millennium scholarship fund to provide financial assistance to young people .
Mr. Bill Matthews ( Burin - St.
the people of Canada have been consulted .
one - third of every tax dollar has to go to pay the interest on the debt .
we want Quebec to stay in Canada and help build this wonderful country .
i would like to remind the hon. member that there is a difference between a contribution and a loan .
i come from the city of Winnipeg .
about half a million young Canadians are out of work .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
that proposal was made in the first week of the campaign .
perhaps the results of the Krever report and the recent supreme court judgment will finally give Canadians some real answers about where blame should be laid in that very important area .
the maintenance of RCMP services at Dorval and Mirabel continues to be the subject of a wide range of speculation .
on September 19 , 1997 , Mrs. Louise Harel , Quebec labour minister , wrote a letter to the Minister of Human Resources Development , asking him for a moratorium on this move since it goes against the spirit of the Quebec - Canada agreement in principle on manpower training , which is aimed at making both federal and provincial service points more accessible , not less so as is the case here .
resuming debate .
it is not uncommon in the private sector to have unfunded pension plans , which only recently companies are beginning to address .
they are worried , anxious about the approaching winter .
Mr. Speaker , just a couple of comments on members who have already spoken .
it is open for debate and discussion .
the government has been very concerned about investment in the area of science and technology .
this short term performance is not a permit to open the floodgates of government spending .
we do however have some concerns about how the process to achieve the inclusion of a new grain would be triggered .
we keep hearing that .
this bill provides directors with the defence of due diligence and brings the Canada Business Corporations Act into line with most provincial statutes .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
after hearing the feel good banalities of the throne speech , does any Canadian really feel inspired and believe that we are being wisely led or being protected from the criminal and given community peace ?
the pay as you go financing is no longer fair , appropriate and possible .
Mr. Speaker , death stalks all of us and can be cruel , but never more so than when it takes the life of the young .
during the consultation there was discussion - and Canadians have provided guidance to the government - that disability benefits should be removed from the Canada pension plan .
the Speech from the Throne is the government blueprint for the coming term .
the auditor general today stated in his report that he could find no clearly stated national policy for sustainable fisheries .
was it the NDP amendment they were ashamed of ?
Mr. Speaker , it is nice to be back here .
you will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament .
aboriginal PEOPLES
Mr. Brent St. Denis :
the government can undertake to listen to all members and to hopefully consider and incorporate some of the ideas that might flow from my proposed debate into a national fisheries policy , especially as it pertains to sustainable fisheries and the difficulties that are being faced by fishers on the west coast , in particular because of the salmon dispute and in the Atlantic because of the decline in our fish stocks .
to take this one step further a lot of people are saying that they are concerned about the amount of money in the fund .
because of that , he had a lifelong dream to come to Canada .
Quebeckers must realize that 93 cents out of every dollar cut in health care in Quebec results from cuts made by the federal government , not by the Quebec government ; that is right , 93 cents out of every dollar .
Mr. G 茅 rard Asselin ( Charlevoix , BQ ) :
* * *
i do not claim otherwise .
( motion agreed to )
that is not all that has been said .
they have some personal interest to me as somebody who has advised numbers of governments on international terrorism and its control .
the public must know that .
what did we get for $ 1 billion ?
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon
you will remember G 茅 rald Martineau from the Union nationale .
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) :
the standard of living is high , very much as a result of the progress and the initiatives taken by the Liberal Party of which I am a proud member .
are they listening ?
the Speaker :
the minister promised us a full report here in the House .
that effort , which we undertake in common , will underwrite our efforts to develop more knowledge about four aspects of innovation in particular .
second , I want to tell you about my own campaign .
the member talked about the national forum on health .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
however the generosity expressed from across Canada was remarkable and will never be forgotten .
i know , Mr. Speaker , that it is your job to create a respectful political climate and at the same time favourable working conditions for all members who are elected to serve the public interest in this great Parliament of Canada .
i think of the relationship of building strong aboriginal government with a focus on developing the capacity for a transparent and accountable aboriginal government .
one of our goals as a country must be to continue providing all our citizens with access to the highest possible quality of health care and the other tools they will need to enjoy healthy lives as we move into the 21 st century .
i am keenly aware that trade starts at home with sound domestic policies .
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian
world RURAL WOMEN ' S DAY
in conclusion , I must say that I became involved in federal politics under the banner of the Liberal Party of Canada because I believe that this country can not only survive but prosper provided that the central , regional and provincial powers find a way to join forces instead of squabbling or even trying to split this country up , as the PQ government in Quebec and its prophets of doom and division , the Bloc Quebecois members , are currently doing .
health
what are they ?
as any dog will tell you , a dry bone is better than no bone at all .
this was the rule as they explained to us by referring to many precedents and to past practice .
yesterday , the minister said in the House that the government would prefer to negotiate rather than resort to legislation to settle the issue of pay equity .
a lot of people voted on the basis of cutting taxes .
i hope the House would indulge me at the beginning .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅
justice
just to be absolutely clear , did the Canadian government know anything at all about the mission in Jordan in which Canadian passports were used ?
our government supported this initiative and , on April 22 , the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs introduced a motion to that effect here in this House .
i ask you and your party to look at that .
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member had all night to think about that and if that is the best that he can come up with it is pretty pathetic .
the Speaker
Mr. Paul Szabo :
in order for Canada to be truly a land of opportunity we must develop an economic atmosphere which speaks to young Canadians , which tells them they have a future in Canada .
if the Minister of Human Resources Development wishes to reply to this question , he may do so .
i told the House earlier that I have asked officials to look into the news reports this morning .
this is further evidence of this government ' s total lack of imagination .
first it is completely inconsistent with the previously stated position of the Liberal Party itself .
this is very short .
it has been absolutely ignored in every way imaginable .
agreed .
i would like to thank all those members who read my proposed amendment , as I did , at the swearing - in ceremony .
i guess I just wanted to make members aware that this has been happening in the Atlantic provinces for quite a long time , having been , myself , a statistic of that .
we see a trend toward a lower and lower wage economy .
hon. members can look up that word .
obviously shameful .
young people are asking why in the world they are being asked to contribute to something that they will never draw from .
if a majority of fishermen said they were going to sell their fish and produce to a certain group of people and that the rest of the fishermen would have to comply , it would not be acceptable .
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to invite all members of Parliament to join me this evening at the National Aviation Museum for the unveiling of the Monitor jet trainer aircraft .
Canadian families have been struggling to balance their household budgets over the last several years .
this is the balance we need .
but today we witness a fair degree of economic activity especially in the key sectors of Etobicoke - Lakeshore .
when will Canada ratify this convention and thus keep a red book promise and take an important step toward marine and fishery conservation ?
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
it is unacceptable for the people of Bras d ' Or to be forced to stand in line and take a number to access even minimal health care .
i am pleased to speak to the very necessary changes that are about to take place over the next little while .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
i am only a couple of months into my term of office and I find myself on the opposite side of another important issue in my province , the education debate .
it is the image of the nation I wish to become .
it claims to be the party of fairness .
the results on election night were a strong indication that Canadians have faith in the direction the government was taking them .
there were a few comments made by the hon. minister about the royal commission on aboriginal peoples .
we all know that the worst thing that could happen to this Parliament would be for there to be a slippage , a sideways skid , and for there to be an attempt to link this constitutional amendment with the language rights of anglophone minorities , something which , as you know , all hon. members hold dear .
we are also giving our students in places like Knowlton , Otterville or Cambridge Bay the same advantages provided by the computer age as students who may be studying in Toronto , Montreal or Vancouver .
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) :
once again , on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois , I offer heartfelt condolences to his family and friends .
if there is near unanimous support for the amendment in Quebec and few individuals or organizations are interested in appearing before the committee , then the deadline will not be a problem .
i would also like to congratulate the prime minister and his gracious wife Aline on their 40 th wedding anniversary a few weeks ago .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i regret to inform the large number of members who want to ask questions that the time for questions and comments has expired .
he provides the link between the government ' s action and the Liberal Party of Canada .
my patients , when they go to the United States , understand too when asked to write a cheque for $ 10,000 for their health care insurance .
we are celebrating world teachers day on October 5 .
i am especially pleased to see the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food leading this industry into the next century .
the verdict is clear : ordinary people and seasonal workers are hard hit by the changes introduced by my predecessor , the former member for Acadie - Bathurst .
we will be there day in and day out .
the public has had too many cases where their governments have said this is what our people want in terms of constitutional change , and found out later that that was not the case .
part IV of the current Canadian Wheat Board Act provides the Canadian Wheat Board with single desk control over the export of wheat and barley , while part III deals with the acquisition of grain from producers , pooling and initial payment .
Mr. Speaker , today I am introducing this Reform bill dealing with the rights of Canadians to know what their government is pulling on them .
reform says it will guarantee benefits for current seniors , but it does not say how it will provide funding for it .
will he made representations to the Minister of Health to have the legislation changed ?
in closing , if a mother starves her child it is called child abuse , but if the Liberals starve a million children it is called balancing the books .
that we are in a position today to even talk about this particular subject matter , namely how we are going to split the surplus , is only because Canadians and this Canadian government had the vision and made the sacrifices necessary to be in this position .
the approach of the CRTC scares away quality entrepreneurs and risk takers which this government states it wants to attract .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
it is hard for me to believe they are concerned about the hardships these people face .
does he believe one can be bought with a contribution in return for some assets ?
the Chair has already ruled that was not a point of order .
we must not bicker among ourselves when the future of our country hangs in the balance .
madam Speaker , thank you for the opportunity to speak on Bill C - 2 .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
* * *
in the whole area of health care and caring for seniors and children we have said over and over again that if the government would only look at it as something which is an important social investment and a job creation tool , we would be a lot better off in this country .
this too was done without the knowledge of defence counsel .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i would like to address three main points which arise from the legislation .
Bradford West Gwillimbury in the south of my riding has a population of 17,000 and has outpaced Barrie in developing a strong , multicultural mosaic .
don ' t be arrogant .
contents
this government has shown little regard for the safety of Canadians .
when he says that , because he is talking about provincial and federal powers , he can only mean changes to the Constitution .
from that perspective all of us in this House have been entrusted with an important duty .
from the latest statistics I learned that an estimated 4.941 million , almost one Canadian in six , were living below the poverty line .
if I said the government has made sacrifices , I am really saying that the public has made sacrifices within the last four to five years to help the government balance its budget .
Mr. Yvan Loubier
mining , forestry and the fisheries are very active and the main driving force of the local economy .
this is a great honour , therefore , and your friends and family , the members of your party and certainly those who elected you will be very proud of you .
clearly this is a concern that people in other provinces have both in respect of the Newfoundland situation and the Quebec situation .
what must be pointed out is that the most recent data , including those from Environment Canada , show that Canada has not respected its commitments .
agreed .
this whole debate talks about spending .
privilege
it is now in the position to make strategic investments in our children and our youth , our health , our communities , and our knowledge and creativity while continuing to improve the nation ' s finances .
we must determine what is a just sharing of powers , what is a just treatment of a unique culture and unique province within the constitutional framework , what is a just guarantee of minority rights within the part and within the whole .
look at the wheat board grains .
in a moment I will tell the House just how long and hard they work compared to citizens from other countries around the world .
Ms. Colleen Beaumier ( Brampton West - Mississauga , Lib . ) : moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 208 , an act to amend the Access to Information Act .
to put it very directly , it is proposing pension reform that is going to overwhelmingly affect middle class Canadians .
we are very happy to be back in this legislature and in this Parliament and to find the voice we had lost in the last few years .
we settled the manpower training program and many others .
forty - four members , constituting the majority of the Quebec deputation , 60 percent of the deputation in fact , that is what the Bloc Quebecois represents .
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard
this is in question with the government once again cosying up to the big brand name drug companies , and I might add with a little pressure from the Reform Party .
i will surely look at the precedents and refresh my memory .
in six months .
the new base of world public order in relations between states is economic - industrial .
finally , other tools have been announced .
we have , and will continue to develop biking , hiking and cross country trails that go on for hundreds of kilometres .
strong families are the fundamental building block of Canadian society .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
the Speech from the Throne highlights work that we are undertaking with the provinces and territories to create a national children ' s agenda .
it is recorded at page 2020 of the Journals of October 17 , 1995 that Reformers thought so highly of the Senate ' s legislative work they voted against the proposed amendment .
criminal CODE
the committees should be a second defence for Canadians to be protected from unintended implications or oversights , but committees need a sufficient amount of time to conduct an effective analysis of government policy .
often they are working as hard as they possibly can .
hon. Andy Scott :
as elected representatives , members of Parliament are accountable to the public .
the use of radar was pioneered by our visitors , developing into a technology that protected Canada through the cold war but , more importantly , by detecting the earliest stages of enemy air attacks .
Canadians want us to address aboriginal children and youth .
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) :
my children have attended there and they tell me what is going on .
unfortunately the physical layout and the daily operations at Kingston Pen are not conducive to managing these maximum security offenders .
the hon. member can find those numbers himself .
just yesterday the auditor general reported his findings to the House .
we also have programs in our health institutions , municipalities , police forces and schools to be able to develop grassroots programs to assist communities in dealing with racism and tolerance .
Mr. Jason Kenney
we will be the first to admit we have received assistance from this and other governments , but the assistance has always been a stop - gap measure , in times of emergency to meet each crisis as it comes along .
first of all , I want to thank the constituents of Compton - Stanstead who entrusted me with the important task of representing them in the House of Commons .
is that the official position of the Reform Party , that the millionaires in Canada pay more than they should be paying ?
tourism plays a significant role in the economic mosiac of Kitchener and surrounding areas .
the fact is that some provinces , including Ontario , Quebec , British Columbia and Alberta , would not have lost money if federal and provincial sales taxes had been harmonized .
Mr. Speaker , I have two petitions pursuant to Standing Order 36 .
unfortunately , their content and their comprehension remains at about the level of the previous Parliament .
Mr. Paul DeVillers :
we have some serious concerns about the legislation .
for over a week now , members have been trying to shed light on this dark side of the Liberal Party organization and , more specifically , the federal government .
unfortunately that integrity and the safety of Canadians abroad have been compromised by Israeli agents using Canadian passports for an operation in Jordan .
* * *
if anyone has been insulted in the past four years , it is the poor families in Canada , the sick and the students , who have suffered from the savage cuts of the Minister of Finance and his government .
Mr. Roy Cullen :
some hon. members :
they all have demands for improvement .
some hon. members :
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
i understand that my provincial counterpart in Quebec , the hon. attorney general , is appealing that case .
landmines
in other words , all rate reductions in the world do not stimulate the economy and do not create any new employment .
the most important thing is to engage in the kind of process that we put before the Israeli government this weekend to make sure that it no longer uses our passports for these kinds of purposes .
the Deputy Speaker :
the Speaker said : " It would be bold to suggest that no circumstance could ever exist for a prima facie question of privilege to be made where there was a deliberate attempt to deny answers to an hon. member '' .
working with the private sector and provincial governments , a Canada - wide mentorship program will be developed .
Canadians should understand that we are talking about getting into a more diversified portfolio of investments so there is a possibility to earn even higher rates of return .
it is an asset , both social and economic , of singular value .
i would like to recognize the presence in the gallery of some constituents from North Vancouver , Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie .
six months ago they were made aware of that .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate you on your re - election and will do so more formally and thoroughly tomorrow .
he got elected because he is in primarily an urban constituency .
it is the federal government ' s fault to a large degree because it is the one that encouraged people to keep fishing when everyone knew fish stocks were dwindling .
we have come in at 9.9 % They are improving the rate of return for the CPP fund by investing it prudently and by having a diversified portfolio of securities at an arm ' s length from the government .
by the way , will the minister admit that his solution to health , education and poverty problems is to cut $ 42 billion instead of $ 48 billion as initially planned ?
great people have spoken in this House .
that is the slogan that member campaigned on .
what is its approach to addressing some of the difficulties that Atlantic Canadians are facing , keeping in mind that those problems are national problems as well ?
under the Constitution - which you like to bring up when it suits your purpose - the federal government is only required to transfer tax revenues .
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( London West , Lib . ) :
it must be made more accessible , more equitable and more sympathetic toward victims of crime .
it is not a mere example of federal - provincial co - operation , but the result of efforts by governments of all political stripes , whether Liberal , New Democratic or Conservative , working together to improve the well - being of our children and prepare a better future for them .
we managed to hold the line on spending and , in 1987 , the former government managed to create a surplus in the government ' s operating budget .
he may recall that in the last Parliament we had incidents of this kind and the Speaker intervened .
prayers
i have not seen in Ontario where any tax cut has increased the numbers of jobs .
with respect to accountability , members who were here in 1993 will remember that the throne speech referred on numerous occasions to integrity , to ethics , to ethics commissioners , to guidelines for ministers , to accountability .
i see a correlation between education , teaching and the family .
that gives me optimism for the future .
as I mentioned earlier -
in the subcommittee on the special import measures act last year members heard that in many cases it was easier to export from the American states to our provinces than it is from provinces like Ontario .
is the minister prepared to ensure that there will be public consultations on the MAI and , if so , what mechanisms is he planning to use ?
we also put forward a document on improving personal taxation to make the system fairer and to ensure that families , especially low and medium income ones with children , get the benefit of such reform .
the Speaker :

i want to go back to research and development .
i spoke earlier in my remarks before question period about the fact that Reform is in this House despite the fact that in the last Parliament they said we would not be back .
miss Deborah Grey
Mr. Paul DeVillers
it is on the floor of the House of Commons because of developments in Quebec where there were suggestions or allegations of influence peddling .
we will maintain the position that we have advanced in the international battle against the Helms - Burton law that a state in the application of its own national laws is limited as to any purported extraterritorial reach by the legal principles of international comity and the duty at the same time to respect the legal sovereignty of other states .
markets are opening up increasingly toward Asia .
that is something we have to take a serious look at when this bill goes before the committee .
however , we thought there was some movement in accepting the inadequacies of the distinct society clause and accepting the premiers ' view that the language has to be changed and the concept has to be changed .
my last point concerns an alternative framework for pension reform .
Mr. Speaker , the Bloc leader should get his facts straight and let the RCMP do its job .
it has income tax hikes riding on top of the de - indexation of the tax system imposed by the Tories in 1986 .
madam Speaker , you do not have a quorum in the House at the present time .

this is most discouraging to the disabled who usually have to go through considerable personal sacrifices to supplement meagre benefits with a meagre income .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy :
my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs .
however , let us not confuse matters .
the changes to the public pension system as proposed by this bill continue the trend of the Liberal government of penalizing the most vulnerable members of our society : low income workers , many of whom are women , the disabled and seniors .
he is clearly concerned regarding the implications for Canada ' s future relations with Israel .
more important , there is a criminal investigation under way and I am sure the issues the hon. member has raised will be gone into thoroughly in the course of the investigation .
they came to us with completely meaningless concepts , empty shells , such as the rather comical idea of principal homeland .
this success is a testament to the commitment of Oxford ' s citizens to take advantage of the programs that can benefit them as we prepare to enter the new millennium .
we are asking them to be robbed .
this includes recognition of national standards , a covenant in the area of health care , an agreement by the provinces to enforce those standards and also a dispute settlement mechanisms in the area of health care .
this is absolutely absurd .
it is part of a bargain between the Canadian people and their government .
Mr. Lynn Myers :
it is not .
i see a great historical and political analogy between the end of the 19 th century politically and the end of the 20 th century .
yeas
we have set the direction for social security into the next century .
he said :
we need to fight crime to take back our streets .
i wrote RCMP Commissioner , Phil Murray , and asked him to do his job .
the FAMILY
i will allow the Prime Minister to respond because the question is on the code of conduct .
Mr. Speaker , the government understands that Canadians want their tax dollars well spent whether on health care or defence .
the polling booths are now open to vote .
we have accepted our civic responsibilities as members of this House .
it was said that we have come too far and have worked too hard to restart the cycle of careless spending .
yet there is absolutely nothing on that in the speech from the throne at all .
younger Canadians want affordable education and fairness in their tax load .
i am serving notice that I fully intend to be particularly vigilant on this issue .
the Canadian premiers unanimously supported Quebec ' s request at St. Andrews , because they considered it unfair to Quebec that it got no similar compensation when $ 1 billion was given to the maritimes to harmonize the GST with the provincial sales taxes .

Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :

immigration fails to protect our borders and Canada is embarrassed before the world with the existence of the slavery pipeline .
it tries to strike a balance between the freedom of the member to speak and the member ' s responsibility to abide by the rules of decorum and procedure intended to benefit all members .

CANADIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE
madam Speaker , I appreciate the member ' s comments but I do want to assure him that we have compassion on the government side .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
that this House condemn the government for making their 50 / 50 election promise on any future surpluses without adequate public debate as to the optimal size of government , taxes and debt , thus threatening to repeat Canada ' s 27 year old history of irresponsible spending , creating high debt , financed by high taxes , causing high unemployment .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
it is precisely because we want to strengthen it that we want a debate .
i asked whether there would be an information highway for francophones .
is that not what we have heard across the floor in the last four years from the Reform Party , that we should trust people to make the decisions in their own best interests ?
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel
however , as my colleague said so well , some people are in dire straits .
guess what ?
who helped ?
the government will not be relying on borrowing moneys .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
there is a school of thought in the country that says a referendum is a very blunt instrument with which to adjust or take away the rights of minority groups .
future beneficiaries who will be in receipt of retirement pensions will see a change in benefits because calculations will be based on five years of pensionable earnings instead of the current three years .
Mr. Speaker , the answer is no , I was not aware .
would the Prime Minister confirm that , as stated by Mr. Spector , there is or has previously been collusion between the Canadian and Israeli secret services on the use of Canadian passports by Mossad agents ?
unfortunately the Reform candidate did not make it this time around , but the next time is going to be another story .
agreed .
for my part , I intend as much as possible to limit my comments to the motion before the House .
Mr. Claude Drouin ( Beauce , Lib . ) :
Mr. Peter MacKay
there is no probably about it , it is the best settlement .
it bribed , cajoled and did everything it could to the Atlantic provinces , and this is what we got stuck with .
the previous speaker from British Columbia mentioned his construction firm and the number of houses he made per year .
all of our regions will be better off with the changes and improvements that we have made in the governance of this country .
the result of consistent overspending and borrowing over the last 30 years gave Canada a debt that grew from $ 20 billion in 1970 to approximately $ 600 billion today .
i saw that with hard work comes success .
hon. Herb Gray
it is with very great pleasure that I announce to the House formally this afternoon the appointment of Mr. Justice Bastarache of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada .
the motion obviously implies that any new spending is bad spending .
provisions which relate to only one province can be amended by the less rigorous section 43 amending formula which requires only the consent of Parliament and of the relevant province ' s legislative assembly .
we promised that we would address economic and social priorities through selected tax cuts , and we will honour that promise .
this is a tremendous undertaking and will go a long way to hooking these communities to the information highway .
i ask myself , have I done what I set out to do in being the best leading example of fatherhood to my family .
i was not surprised to hear the member from the NDP trying to draw a parallel between us and former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans .
i would like to see how our stories match up .
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu 茅 bec , BQ ) :
they ask that the federal government do something about this matter .
we should learn something from these experiences .
it is quite clear that our young Canadians ' real facility with technology will be the true leveller in our society .
to conclude , let me say a word or two about Canada ' s future .
Mr. Preston Manning
we know that this company was awarded $ 1.3 million for an extremely important mining development in northern Quebec , one that is extremely beneficial to the people of Abitibi - T 茅 miscamingue in general and one that will have major economic impact .
he talked about the fact that the Liberals have not been able to do much about unemployment .
we are all proud of our ethnic heritage but we are prouder to be Canadians first .
it also gives us the flexibility we need to experiment and innovate in order to succeed in a rapidly changing world .
however under Bill C - 4 the minister maintains the authority to choose the president of the board of directors , a person who will double as the wheat board ' s chief executive officer .
i want to address specifically the issue of debt .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
i find it interesting that the member talks about the $ 1 billion scholarship fund when the students themselves are scoffing at it .
i remind hon. members that it is necessary to address the Chair .
the hon. member for Charlotte , on a point of order .
Mr. Paul Bonwick
what is a realistic projection of future surpluses once the federal budget is balanced ?
i listened with great interest to the member from the Bloc Quebecois and there are a few things I would like to point out .
i welcome both communities to the Erie - Lincoln riding and look forward to representing them to the best of my ability .
i hope we will find agreement in this House to pass this bill sometime in the near future .
on behalf of the Progressive Conservative caucus I offer my condolences to members of the Ellis family on their loss .
third , in this question of privilege the hon. member refers to regulations governing disclosure of information .
we are a great nation and shall become one of the greatest in the Universe if we preserve it .
we both still have relatives in Quebec .
Mr. David Chatters ( Athabasca , Ref. ) :
the expression refers to social benefits , manpower mobility , the ability to cope with flexible work patterns , etc.
i would like to know in no uncertain terms whether or not the member from the New Democratic Party recognizes the existence of a Quebec people .
the Labour Prime Minister in the United Kingdom said that the end of the welfare state has come .
someone on the other side who was speaking earlier made some reference to your looks .
introduction and first reading
the five minute questions and comments period has expired so I would ask him to be brief .
that being said , let us take a look once again at the Reform Party .
f . Weldon from the economic studies and policy analysis division of the department wrote this in " The Rising Burden of Payroll Taxes in Canada " in 1993 : " The long run effect of a one percentage point increase in the effective rate of payroll taxes is estimated to be a decline of nearly 1 percent in employment '' .
gone are the days when the Canadian economy was expanding and thousands of jobs were created automatically .
i employed carpenters , plumbers , electricians , excavation people with their equipment , roofers , drywallers and any number of people .
these are employer and employee contributions .
Reis , Advin , Sherwin and Christopher .
environment
there are three main thrusts to the reform .
it must also plan for the increased demand for old age security , because even if we control spending , there will still be this annual increase .

Mr. Jim Hart :

Mr. Michel Bellehumeur

if this country were bankrupt , the problems the member is describing , which I do not deny exist , would be compounded right up the social ladder .
i am a little puzzled by that .
introduction and first reading
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac , NDP ) :
i would like to hear him on that .
we are concerned about the government ' s poor commitment to the issue of reducing taxes .
question .
when the member insults the Minister of Finance and the government he is insulting Canadians right across this great country and in his province as well .
Mr. Speaker , it is of course false to say that the government has been evading the law .
Mr. John Reynolds
petitions
we have withdrawn from programs of direct involvement in mining and forestry development and have suggested transferring management of social housing to the provinces .
before I reiterate the benefits of the government ' s well considered plan , I will refute the feeble assertions and the rhetorical rantings of our opponents .
i want to say to her husband Art and family that I love them and I will do the best job I can do in the House .
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
and more than five members having risen :
Mr. Robert D . Nault
i am pleased and proud to support the government ' s initiatives .
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau , BQ ) :
that diversity I am pleased to say is very much reflected in the caucus that I have the privilege to lead in this Parliament .
i wonder if the hon. member would like to expand a bit more on his thoughts on what needs to be done , with some specificity , so that we can take those ideas to heart , knowing his expertise .
Mr. Yvan Loubier
the third assumption is that if there is a problem we have to spend money .
the SchoolNet is turning out to be an ideal learning tool .
that means that we will have professionals who are going to manage that fund to make sure we get a competitive return with other investors in the marketplace .
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) :
we thank him for that .
referred to Standing Committees
contrary to section 223 of the 1982 legislation , there is not even a numerical criterion .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for Chicoutimi for raising this question .
we have job equity .
it is the party that rather than assume its responsibility continues to blame others .
through enacting the legislation after careful consideration with Canadians the government will ensure that the Canada pension plan is there for future generations , that it is there at an affordable premium and that the benefits are guaranteed for those future generations .
imagine : " I have just told you what President Chirac has just allowed me to tell you '' .
( motion agreed to )
therefore there is commitment by this government to deal with the retirement income system .
but what we want to see is the Prime Minister at least agreeing with the provincial premiers on a common plan of action .
i also listened carefully to some of the questions his colleagues asked of colleagues of mine earlier today with respect to the understanding of the existence or non - existence of the Quebecois people .
it is an expression that I think is widely understood by members in the House as not being derogatory if that is not the intent of the person who is saying it .
the taxpayers of the wonderful riding of Bourassa , in Quebec , have elected me to take part in the building of a strong Canada for the year 2000 , a strong Canada for our children , a strong and united Canada proudly looking to the future .
it is as unique as the country itself .
young people were hired through a Canada youth service corps project to complete renovations for the centre .
the fact is that post - secondary education and student loan debt has now reached a crisis proportion .
as noted earlier , anyone currently in receipt of retirement pension under the CPP will not see that pension change .
Christian based religion has always played a very important part in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador , and in Newfoundland society in general .
if it did that it would begin to realize that the Reform Party is on to something .
in fact it has been suggested that internal trade barriers may be costing Canadians up to $ 8 billion per year .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
miss Deborah Grey
there is a generation of Canadians that went to war to pay the price for his freedom .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of the Environment .
how can we talk about them being independent when we do not give them any opportunities ?
many Canadians and Erie - Lincoln residents are concerned about the unity of our fine country .
that is a deficit .
if so , what is the government ready to do about it ?
* * *
accordingly the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
that is why we see the alternative package .
coming from the other side , however , that sort of petty partisan politics does not surprise me .
i have not even felt the extra money jingling in my jeans pocket those people continue to talk about .
our social and economic situations also help to determine the quality of our health .
the system is a good system .
when I go to my riding , people do not say " Come on , let ' s spend more '' .
they remember when the law was different and we did not have the pervasive street trade .
when I was going around in my constituency during the election campaign , I talked to a lot of people in the coffee shops , on the doorsteps and on the farms throughout the constituency .
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure and an honour to take part in this reply to the Speech from the Throne which was laid before the House two days ago .
this makes allowance for progressive diseases , which is very important .
there are those who would purport to eliminate that benefit .

i am confident we will be successful .

and then are we going to have national standards in the education sector ?
where is the government ' s response to families that suffer and are at risk because of violence and because of defects in the Young Offenders Act , defects in the parole system , defects in the court system and defects in the penal system ?
why must we always start our negotiations with a knife to the throat ?
Mr. Speaker , I would like to comment and make some response on the present plan we want to bring in .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment ?
i do not want to hear about governments in the past who did this or that .
we will resume with questions and comments .

it is too important to be a partisan one , for it goes to the very core of our democratic life .
Mr. Speaker , the government professes to be concerned about the unity of federation , yet when a B.C. senator commented on the topic last week the minister responded with disdain .
we feel this every day in Ontario : a mission of tax cuts ; smaller government ; survival of the fittest ; no positive role for government ; knee jerk , simplistic approaches ; black and white with no shades of grey .

i was reminded as a result of his speech of the very clear reason the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney was destroyed in the election of 1993 .

obviously because of medical technology and so on , it means that Canadians as a whole are healthier and we are going to live longer .
having established that the opposition has admitted today and possibly in its speeches over the last couple of days that the purpose of what it is doing is to prevent the bill from proceeding to the next stage , I believe that any reasonable person would claim that the government has an equal right to propose measures to ensure that the bill does proceed in good and proper form .

we are bursting with pride , and rightly so .

the Speaker :
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
it is my responsibility to see to it that hon. members ' rights are respected in the House .
we are not afraid to listen to people who have opinions and want to have their opinions registered for the record .
we like to see those who are disabled , disadvantaged or have experienced unexpected hardships succeed .
their architecture will be new but it will be Canadian .
Cape Bretoners are angry .
we are the government that brought the deficit down from $ 42 billion ahead of the schedule fixed by the Reform Party which called for a balanced budget by the year 2000 .
the inadequate resources devoted to private members ' bills especially at peak periods adversely affects the ability of all members of this House to perform their parliamentary duties .
why do you not want to have public debate on the floor of the House of Commons ?
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau :
the pay as you go financing is no longer fair and no longer appropriate .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
in our own country somebody has been let back in either with his British passport or a Canadian passport .
the kind of scandal in which the Liberals are currently involved - and this is indeed a scandal - has not been seen in Quebec for over 20 years , ever since the Parti Quebecois first came to power .
our approach was different .

Mr. Speaker , I find this very interesting .
that the amendment be modified by adding after the words " legislative program that '' , the following : " in failing to set targets and timetables to reduce unemployment and in failing to strengthen national programs such as medicare which promote the equality of all Canadians and the unity of the country is an affront to fundamental Canadian values '' .
if she does not know , I will be glad to remind her .
in those days , the CMA had 167 members .
was this simply an oversight ?
hon. Paul Martin
i am not sure many would agree that this is totally out of character for them .
as a French Canadian , I am a second class citizen .
in response to the comments received further refinements were made to the legislation and revised draft legislation was released in July for further comment .
the $ 600,000 used came from the employment insurance fund .
we feel it is inappropriate that Reform based its recommendations on what we feel is a worst case economic scenario over the next 20 years .
like all citizens , we kept no tally sheets .
Canadians want tax cuts .
Mr. Murray Calder ( Dufferin - Peel - Wellington - Grey , Lib . ) :
let us be clear : the government is promising us money it has already invested and it is promising to invest at least that much again .
Ms. Jocelyne Bujold - Girard
Mr. Speaker , the member is more interested in theatrics than in facts .
each and every one of them made a contribution .
she taught us to reach inside ourselves to become something greater than what we are by helping those who are less fortunate .
we read about them regularly .
the estimate of the funding that would be required is $ 18 billion a year .
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
it appears to be a reasoned amendment .
that is a clear and precise statement consistent with the 1995 Helsinki agreement guaranteeing the territorial integrity of participating states .
are we to believe , and this is an extremely important question the public is asking today , that no government minister was aware that a certain Mr. Corbeil , a Liberal party staffer , was collecting funds at $ 25,000 a shot ?
our young will do so in the next century .
Mr. Jim Hart
last year the government established technology partnerships Canada to make fully repayable investments in innovative firms that are developing leading edge knowledge based technologies .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for his kind words and extend some of my own .

the board will have access to audited financial statements .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
it is very clear that Canadians on the whole want the Canada pension plan .
there was a division within Quebec about it and we had to choose which among the different Quebec opinions we would adhere to .
the first thing I ask him is to give us the names of those who received company contributions .
i have heard very few concerns about people not wanting to participate in the plan .
madam Speaker , my answer would be that we will also be prepared to take over 24 Sussex Drive and they better get that right , too .
they bought a ticket , some even bought two , to come to my fundraiser .
the task we have ahead of us today is very simple and straightforward , to elect a Speaker according to the terms of Standing Orders 2 through 6 in chapter 1 .
this is how we , the Quebec people , have been forced in recent years to help lower the federal deficit , to the tune of 72 cents on every dollar contributed .
the $ 30 million program to fight crime is a rehash .

Mr. Peter Mancini
it is sad , a shame really , to see this struggle we thought was over resurface today .
our devotion to individual freedom is our unique characteristic .
Mr. Speaker , I ask that all questions be allowed to stand .
we have just set up the Canadian Race Relations Foundation so that we can deal with the issue of racism across the country .
our future as a country is too precious for us to risk losing it through misunderstanding .
there was a lot of good work that we were able to put forward through that committee .
Mr. Speaker , this reminds me of my first day of return to the House .
this problem has to be resolved by the minister and the government .
Mr. Charlie Power
he talked about a three - legged system yesterday .
that is unacceptable .
there are no less than 1,500 subsidiaries of foreign multinational companies in Quebec .
Mr. Speaker , I was quite intrigued by the comments of the member opposite on the approach of final offer selection arbitration .
they were eloquently stated by the finance minister in the February budget and then reinforced again and again throughout the election campaign .
i come from a region of the country that has suffered unemployment rates of between 15 percent and 20 p . cent for the continual life of the Liberal government .
for some years now , since 1980 , in fact since the fall of the Berlin Wall , we have seen that capitalism is growing by leaps and bounds .
so when he wants to talk about the unity in this country , he should go back to his party bosses and do a little work within his own caucus to see that his message supports unity in this country .

but instead of repairing the damage caused by its policies , the government announces that it will now use this breathing room to systematically interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction .
a member across the way asks when did we realize this .
their partnership with Canadian Aerospace and Sikorsky will develop a new aerospace industry in North Bay .
the throne speech states :
i am about to appoint an arm ' s length board of scientists who will give independent advice on these issues .
the only difficulty with the wheat board is that it has tended to become used as an instrument of political manipulation , and wheat policies have been adapted to the welfare of the party in power .

there is a new influence for good , for prosperity and for unity emerging in this country .

Mr. John Richardson
i believe that the procedures set out in Standing Order 52 will enable members of the House to immediately debate and communicate to the government that the upper house cannot be expected to fulfil the role of sober first thought since the senators represent a political composition which is a reflection of the past and , in particular , a reflection of patronage appointments of the defeated governments of Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney .

our objective is to secure the removal of those controls from application at the Canada - U.S. border .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to participate in the debate on Bill C - 2 .
i feel confident that there is a group of men here , new Members of the House , if you will , who have clearly made up their minds that insofar as they decide it , human welfare is to be given the precedence .
while the Conservatives will continue to represent themselves as a national party in the House they are in essence an Atlantic party with a Quebec contingent .
that is clearly what Bill C - 4 does .
we do that by asking seven basic questions .
four appointments will be made by the Governor General in Council , that is friends once more .
they asked British Columbians if B.C. should renegotiate its place in Confederation and if it should , they asked if secession should be on the table .
he even brags about his 43 tax increases and how he has taken $ 26 billion more from us .
it gave him the ability to confront the issues of our time as he confronted the issues of his with determination , unfailing courtesy and hard work .

however , this was to be expected , given that the council did not have access to all the information contained in the secret and confidential justice department documents that were later filed with the Supreme Court of Canada .

Mr. Speaker , I have listened to the facts which have been brought before the House by both hon. members .
young OFFENDERS ACT
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) :
this was an opportunity for the government to include in the bill or some other bill the removal of the Canadian Wheat Board from the present position it has across the country with transportation .
my question for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is this :
the Deputy Speaker :
those Parliaments were great and those parliamentarians were great because they encouraged their citizens to do great things .
Mr. Bill Matthews ( Burin - St.
Mr. Jim Pankiw ( Saskatoon - Humboldt , Ref. ) :
these high tech companies are selling Canadian products to every corner of the globe .
members of the opposition can continue along that track and can continue to keep their heads buried in the sand and talk about the way it was .
this bill is designed so that if an individual commits three violent offences , the courts must incarcerate that person for life imprisonment .
even though we speak of tax cuts for Canadians , our approach to managing the fiscal dividend is responsible .
while the debate among western farmers with respect to grain marketing is a sharply polarized one , it makes it all but impossible to arrive at one all - encompassing solution .
Ms. Alexa McDonough :
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
the Canada pension plan is one of the defining features of Canada .
i am sure , Mr. Speaker , you will address this proposition and take it under advisement .
will the Conservative Party , of which 13 members are from Atlantic Canada , help us , the New Democratic Party , in pushing the government for a reduction of the HST ?
we have learned to accommodate our differences and diversity and turn them into strengths .
the unions are joining in projects and partnerships that are tremendous examples of what can be done .
why on earth is he still a Liberal ?
hon. Christine Stewart
where there is no revelation , the people cast off restraint ; but blessed is he who keeps the law .
by investing now in the well - being of today ' s children , we improve the long - term health of our society .
it is a true misunderstanding and it originates with the members across the way .
we have been celebrating as a nation Canada ' s hockey victory over the Soviets 25 years ago .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
at the same time I am sensitive to the hon. member and other hon. members .
i see this not only as a challenge but as a wonderful opportunity to work with all my colleagues in this House , to help Canadian businesses to succeed , to help them grow to create jobs and to make Canada the best country in the world .
i was a member of the committee which brought the change , which is that a party that has official status must receive 2 % or more of the number of valid votes cast at an election or 5 % of the votes cast in any individual riding where the party has a candidate .
that was not good enough .
there are so many of them , these volunteers , these heroes and heroines , that it would be impossible to receive them all here in the House of Commons .
if he will allow me , I will turn to the larger issue that he raised about the passports and the attack in Jordan a week ago .
over the decades , English Canada shrank the scope of this confederation agreement .
then they had elections and they won .
in fact , it has been made more explicit to remove all doubt .
in the last parliament Reformers were so comfortable with government bills being introduced in the Senate that they specifically voted on them when division bells were rung .
the leader of the Reform Party himself was alleged to have dipped into secret trust funds and expense accounts for trips , clothes and a private pension plan .
we are not convinced that a 73 percent increase is necessary .
* * *
our prosperity and our ability to create jobs are directly linked to how well we capitalize on international opportunities .
i would like to urge the government to work with us on more specific areas which will help our community to prosper even more .
what we have achieved in comparison to that is that we have paid off our operating debt .
while this minister has worked extremely hard at accommodating Quebec ' s desire to renegotiate its role in Confederation , he responds to the concerns of British Columbians with the verbal equivalent of the Trudeau salute .
the Chair apologizes to the hon. member for Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford .
none of us in the House wants anyone to be left behind .
i see the member for Rimouski , who was there as well , and the leader of the Bloc Quebecois .
the real issue is why is Reform trying to frustrate that debate ?
the minister will also be writing to the chair of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade to arrange his appearance before the committee .
never did they speak to the fact that it was the best way to market in the world today .
so , I hope that , by dint of rubbing shoulders with him in very parliamentary settings , I will convince the hon. member that we cannot in all honesty say that all provinces must be equal , for that would be denying the fact that Quebec is a nation .
for them to notice the plan even on their own admission only three years ago , it has taken them this long to finally catch wind that it has to be changed , that it has to be reformed .
i would like to reiterate the facts of the proposed changes that the hon. Minister of Finance has given on numerous occasions in the last Parliament and which are echoed in this Parliament by many colleagues .
when we are old we have hope that we will have enough income to have our needs met and to have a comfortable life .
in both cases , plan viability is what counts .
i believe he served his province and his country very well and we wish him all the best in his future endeavours .
canada ' s solid economic foundation is something that we put in place with the help and sacrifice of many Canadians .
foreign AFFAIRS
Mr. Speaker , it is an honour and a privilege to rise in this House and speak to an issue that I believe was of concern to all of the residents of Thornhill , the young and the old .
subsidies and grants have proven not effective over the last number of years .
during the last election campaign and in the Speech from the Throne the government talked about crime prevention programs , a most laudable goal .
is it democracy to have somebody in Ottawa dictating to farmers in western Canada what they have to do , no matter what the price ?
modern day pension plans are defined contribution plans .

in a country as wealthy as Canada with its physical and human resources , I find it unacceptable that even one child would go hungry .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
the Chair is satisfied that the amendment by the hon. Leader of the Opposition is in order .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Prime Minister ' s Office confirmed this government has no plan to extend , renew or replace the TAGS program .
i refuse to give my consent .
earlier this year we announced the new youth employment strategy that builds on more than $ 2 billion in new and existing funding for these programs .
Mr. Speaker , I must commend the member .

if the member cares to look at some of the figures from the government he will see that the top 10 percent of income earners in this country pay half of the taxes .
there is no question that this has been a process where hearings were held by a committee that went across the west .
name them .
Canadians also expressed confidence in the government ' s commitment to the protection of social programs on June 2 .
second , all benefits , with the exception of the death benefit , remain fully indexed to inflation .

Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , this week we are celebrating World Maritime Week and I want to take this opportunity to draw to the attention of all members the future of the L 茅 vis shipyard .
in that context I would like to address three issues : job creation , the development of safe and prosperous communities , and the importance of the arts in articulating Canada ' s identity .
anything we can do to help in creating a healthy , vibrant economy and anything that we can do to improve the lot of all citizens in the province of Quebec , English as well as French speaking , I am in favour of it and this party is in favour of it .
he did voice some concerns .
at the last election the composition of the House passed the point where three of the parties , including the official opposition in the House , are not represented at all in that other chamber .
we do not have to research economic theory to know that broadly based rather than targeted government programs provide the bigger bang for the buck .
it is as simple as that .
first I would like to present 87 petitions with the signatures of 2,035 Canadians from seven provinces .
Mr. Dennis J . Mills ( Broadview - Greenwood , Lib . ) :
anybody who says you cannot increase the rates is saying you cannot pay benefits to seniors in the future .
i wonder if the prime minister should not be more concerned about political interference in Canada than about political interference in Mexico .
yesterday the health minister tried to deny that it is 40 percent , so we will grant him that it is just 35 percent , $ 6.8 billion .
Mr. Speaker , there are very serious allegations of influence peddling currently sullying the government .
the Speaker :
Mr. Speaker , this is the first opportunity I have had to stand in the House .
in a similar way the Tories ran their platform in the last election , they essentially said they would do what we would do but they would put it off longer and make more substantial increases in the future .
unfortunately , every year some of these courageous men and women pay the ultimate price for their bravery .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabasca , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , this truly is a wait and see government .
all members in this House when they stand and speak are afforded that protection in this House .
people are fed up paying more and more money to the government for fewer services .
all of us know of middle aged and elderly women who invested most of their lives in raising children in the home and who entered the so - called official workplace , as if the home were not a workplace , late in life or not at all and therefore qualify for little or no CPP benefits .
Mr. Speaker , premiers will choose the appropriate means to consult the public .
i think that the member for Sherbrooke owes the member for Okanagan - Shuswap an apology .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
president OF THE TREASURY BOARD
it costs far too much and delivers far too little .
together we can continue on the path of nation building with tolerance , compassion and generosity as pillars of our Canada .
these youth often find it difficult getting started in the workforce and deserve a better chance .
they are going to make regular reports .
if that is not chastisement with a divided opposition , I do not know what is .
LOUIS RIEL DAY ACT
it is incumbent on us to reflect that .
to conclude , members of the Bloc Quebecois will support this government initiative , which they believe is a step forward .
although everyone agrees on the need for reform of our pensions , the government ' s approach contains some very disquieting elements .
Mr. Speaker , I take issue with one of the premises raised by the member , that it is nature ' s fault the fish are gone .
that is nothing new to us in Cape Breton .
if the member would look at examples in other countries which have done this , such as Britain , Sweden and New Zealand , he would see that the medical services jobs almost doubled as a result of introducing such plans .
urban centres right across the prairies are enormously impacted by the health of the agricultural community .
hon. Diane Marleau
while progress has been made in lowering the deficit , it has come at the expense of jobs and higher taxes .
Mr. Speaker , I remember that in January 1996 we sent a statement to the people of Quebec explaining what had been done in the House of Commons .
yeas
i can quote , for instance , the Helsinki declaration , which states that " Participating states shall respect the principle of the equality in law of peoples and their right to self - determination , by acting at any given time in accordance with the goals and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations '' .
we have outlined an entire plan to help Atlantic Canada get out of the morass that it is now in because of successive Liberal and Tory governments .
obviously , this was the least I could do .
i would like to know if she admits that the government ' s legislative program denies the existence of the people of Quebec and of their culture ?
you undoubtedly know that I lost three previous elections before winning on June 2 .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the agenda our government unveiled in the Speech from Throne is a clear cut action plan for four more years of positive change .
once again it is the frontline workers who can predict what is going to happen if these changes are not forthcoming .

we will continue to try to convince them and their electors that real reform of the federation is possible and preferable to separation from it .
Mr. John Nunziata ( York South - Weston , Ind . ) :
they got it right all right , but let us not let them take any praise for it because the Canadian taxpayers are the ones who had to bear the brunt of that tax torture .
is the hon. member saying that he is against an independent investment board ?
it is true that the Canadian Parliament changed the Canada Elections Act provisions on election expenses .
it is my hope that the newly appointed Minister of Natural Resources will heed the many voices from within the industry and use the expertise of the Canadian population when deciding what his legislative priorities will be and which policies he will be advocating .
Ms. Judi Longfield
either they are to go out and consult in some undefined process which they have not outlined before us , or they are to allow us to set programs .
however , they are fed up with programs that reward not need , but greed .
the pension system is one of the very important three pillars that make up the social safety net .
both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition were full of praise .
in Charlesbourg , they received $ 1,070 ; in Drummond , $ 1,500 ; in Manicouagan , $ 485 ; in Laval - Ouest , $ 2,500 ; and so forth .
our government ' s visionary science and technology strategy has created partnerships with the private sector to develop and bring advanced technology to the market .
within Canada our high payroll and corporate taxes form a barrier to jobs and growth by taxing businesses for every job which they create .
Mr. Ken Epp
we would like to pass on to Mr. Fraser ' s family our wishes and comfort for the honourable life and tradition of service that he brought to this House .
we want to know investment performance .
as the government embarks on rebuilding a sound CPP plan , Canadians who are not now in receipt of CPP need to know that there will be future changes .
if there are pertinent facts that have not been laid on the table as opposed to opinions in terms of personalities , I will permit interventions .
since 1993 Canadians have wanted a change in the federal system .
in this connection , Quebec is justified in asking questions , since it has to go through the Canadian Wheat Board if it wants to export .
i draw the attention of hon. members to the presence in the gallery of the Hon. Tommy G . Thompson , Governor of the State of Wisconsin .
members of the opposition , members of Parliament and Canadians at large will have opportunity to speak at those public meetings .
this is not a tax grab .
we are going to balance the budget in 1998 - 99 .
finally I come to the issue of accountability .
of course there was one measly lone reference in the throne speech to reducing taxes and paying down debt .
others estimate as much as $ 20 billion .
house OF COMMONS
together we have built a country that has become a beacon of hope in an often troubled world torn by strife , wars , poverty , intolerance and lack of compassion .
as a nation we invested in medicare exactly 30 years ago .
a federal government which , let us recall , accepted Newfoundland into Confederation with a close vote in a second referendum .
all of a sudden the government figures out that people will be turning 50 and may want their pensions pretty soon .
madam Speaker , I am not too proud of hearing someone from my region make such a speech and talk so much nonsense in so little time .
i have a question for the hon. member .
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Jean Dub 茅
it has been destroyed by the actions and the laws passed by this House .
i want to read his statement : " As you are no doubt aware , the Reform Party and I do not support the notion of pay equity as outlined by the federal government and the human rights tribunal .
there are a couple of local newspapers that publish weekly and bi - weekly which contain columns where the crimes committed on a weekly basis are listed .
one of the things that concerns me about the debate that is taking place today is that I smell a bit of a witch hunt .
he served two terms in the House .
they want this money set aside and managed in a businesslike fashion .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
as far as we are concerned , if these resolutions are passed or adopted by all the provinces , I said before that the House of Commons has voted on distinct society , and we are prepared to vote on the words chosen by the premiers after a debate in this House .
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
i know that Peggy Witte ' s company , Royal Oak Mines , is certainly not the only one that has deserted our province because of high taxes .
we will play our part .
these children living in the lowest income brackets need assistance .
this uncertainty has been foisted onto the board and onto western farmers by the actions of some of our trading competitors , but what is even more damaging are the activities of that vocal minority of farmers who would do away with the board altogether .
i hope to do the legacy of Mr. Lloyd Crouse justice .

through the Foundation for Innovation we are providing ways in which research infrastructure can be made available .
on March 6 , the Minister of Human Resources Development informed the RCMP of a possible case of influence peddling .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
however , in contrast to the Reform Party we will spend half of our fiscal dividend for social and economic programs for the country , for medicare , education and for research and development .
when and how much ?
these people will not be affected .
for this reason the government will continue to have a window on Canadian Wheat Board affairs , in addition to that line of accountability directly to western farmers .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
the battle against poverty among seniors is far from over .
unless people realize that the law is made to be respected , they lose the thing which holds us together as a society .
he is known probably better than any other premier we have had across Canada for his stance .
committees without consensus
i find it unacceptable that this government continues to move in this direction without recognizing this .
it could have been .
we cannot simply expect that this will happen .
Mr. Jim Abbott
* * *
some parties in the House like to refer to the Speech from the Throne and the government ' s agenda as a return to the past .
Mr. Bernard Bigras
i want to thank the people of Port Moody - Coquitlam for their understanding of Sharon ' s dilemma over these past five to six months .
it would be extremely difficult to build up trust , given that , as a whole , members of this Parliament do not enjoy a great degree of credibility among the public .
the end result was a final report entitled " Agenda for Youth " which laid out a number of steps the government would take to assist young Canadians .
if farmers are to take the responsibility for the contingency fund and not the federal government , why are there still five federal appointees on the board ?
where is the response to the needs of victims of crime ?
they are helping to make this country the greatest country in the world with a parliament that at times seems to be raucous and noisy but a parliament that works , a parliament in which we can all have confidence .
these last few years , the government paid out $ 1 billion to meet its pay equity obligations .
this individual runs down a Canadian company .
Mr. Speaker , we intend to do exactly what we said we would , that is look at the concept of pharmacare as a long term objective with the intention of ensuring that everybody in Canada who needs medication can get medication without price being an impediment .
instead , it relies on an outdated , neo - conservative approach that the free market will provide for all if it is simply left alone .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I was interested in listening to the minister as he was speaking about advantages and the various things that the government is trying to bring into play .
we are the leaders of the G - 7 countries in this .
another great expenditure in the country are the tax giveaways to multinational corporations , to the wealthy in Canada .
if there are any hon. members who have not voted and wish to do so , will they please vote now ?
let us look at the Liberal bagman who is being investigated right now .
that means that there were almost 150 bills tied up in the backlog .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
also , what I find most disturbing is how much money these political parties have available .
the Speaker
hon. Christine Stewart
i think that is important to talk about .
the Speaker :
the values of the marketplace have infiltrated every institution in Canada , the family , the church , the legal system .
that specific offence should not merely be a summarial offence but it should be a hybrid offence .
Mr. Chuck Strahl :
that is where the problem really existed and that is what really counts .
reformers involve themselves with the Senate with some trepidation .
outrageous !
our obligation is to ensure the country we leave to our children is safe , prosperous , free and united .
this program is supposed to help build innovation , research and development in Canada .
his job will not always be easy as there will be voices trying to hold Canada back .
one - half will support the programs Canadians want and deserve and the other half will go toward debt reduction and tax reduction .
hon. Lucienne Robillard
if we are truly serious about helping our nation ' s youth move beyond this crisis , we must all foster a co - operative approach with the private sector .
the board of directors will also have the power to include or exclude certain grain categories .
i am honoured to have been able to keep the members of the Bloc Qu 茅 b 茅 cois opposite , who are defending their ridings , awake .
consultations were held .
adjournment PROCEEDINGS
we have also moved to improve accessibility to post - secondary education by building on initiatives announced in the February 1997 budget which included improved registered education saving plans , increased and expanded education tax measures , extending the period of interest relief for graduates having trouble repaying their loans , and gearing loan repayment to income .
that is why we withdrew from forestry , mining , tourism , social housing and manpower training .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :

the community access program is designed to connect rural and remote areas and aboriginal communities to the Internet .
yesterday , that ' s right .
as is our practice on Wednesday we will now sing O Canada , and we will be led by the hon. member for Etobicoke North .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
for that we must all be pleased .
madam Speaker , I am delighted to respond .
but I would like to tell you that we have inherited an employment insurance system that did not work , that did not meet Canadians ' current needs .
aids
that is what they want and what most Canadians want for their aboriginal brothers and sisters .

hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
one the very few new things mentioned in this speech is that the federal government will now get directly involved in education , in order to , and I quote : " measure the readiness of Canadian children to learn '' , through an innocuous leaflet sent to every home .
many of us have young children .
it makes it very difficult and very competitive .

they did not want it privatized and they certainly did not want it scrapped .
the leader in the other place , a fine but lonely federal Liberal Nova Scotian , was informed that according to the estimates of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce , the surplus in the EI fund will be at $ 16 billion this year .
this will have a disproportionate effect on them , on their revenue and on the decisions they will make with respect to their own savings .

hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
we continue to review items of interest .
to a certain extent , I can only congratulate the Minister of Finance for taking his inspiration from a tried and true Quebec formula .
Mrs. Marlene Jennings
take for example the scholarship fund that the Prime Minister referred to yesterday in his speech , the details of which will no doubt come out over the days and weeks ahead .
when we talk about tax cuts I am very interested in exactly what we are talking about .
that is not his department , that is for the provincial departments of education .
i hope that they are not that out of touch with reality .
it is for those reasons that Saultites should be pleased with the throne speech ' s recognition of tourism and exports as key economic generators .

on June 2 of this year , I began my second term of office , this time as the member for Ahuntsic , in the riding where I have lived with my family for close to 30 years .
nobody in the Bloc received contributions from companies .
parliament
on a personal note , when I was elected to this House in 1972 , Mr. Fraser was in the House .
we therefore want to conclude with some suggestions for repairing the possible defects in the Quebec constitutional amendment which may make it impossible for this House to approve it in its current form .
if it was not for us it would not focus on the debt .
all I suggest is we just hold on to our hats and wait for some of these answers .
in a consultation meeting with my constituents which I held fairly recently with a mixture of small and medium size businesses in Etobicoke - Lakeshore , I heard that the people of Etobicoke - Lakeshore want a country that is fiscally strong , safe and tolerant .
call in the members .
the thing that will not put milk on the table is the emerging multitude of government programs that take money away from working Canadians and leave little for them and their families .
i learned that by working together as Canadians from Quebec and elsewhere in this country we can ensure a better future for ourselves and our children and make a most significant contribution to the well - being of the international community .
we are going to consult with Canadians and with those who know on the future of the health protection branch .
however , the word also applies to the party currently forming the government if not more than to the preceding government , when it draws an annual surplus of between $ 6 billion and $ 9 billion out of the pockets of the impoverished workers by unduly increasing the employment insurance premium , while cutting benefits , shortening the period of eligibility for employment insurance and tightening the requirements .
i requested the Federal Bureau of Competition to investigate the agreement which eliminates competition and choices and limits competition .
no vision .
if anyone does not believe me , just look at the jobs transitions fund that is being misused with and the questions which arose in question period about that .
when the plan was designed it was assumed there would be six taxpaying workers to every dependent retiree .

she will be remembered simply and affectionately as Mother .
i believe that investing today in our vulnerable children will yield major dividends tomorrow .
i would say to him that we need to continue to work very hard to ensure that is the case .
Paul Martin Senior and his Liberal cronies said that it would " never cost more than a few hundred dollars '' .
the amendment that came to the House of Commons and was passed had to be implemented in Newfoundland .

it has not improved .
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Anjou - Rivi 猫 re - des - Prairies , Lib . ) :
Mr. Peter Adams
my colleagues , as it is nearly 2 p.m. , perhaps we could begin with members ' statements .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) :
goods AND SERVICES TAX
Mr. Speaker , that is sheer bunk .
we would have no record of what exactly happened .
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) :
i believe this debate will be a turning point in our children ' s attitudes toward our generation .
we must make sure as members of Parliament that we indicate to Canadians that we are willing to participate in a program where all Canadians can share in the benefits of our country .
even when he did not serve as an elected MP , Mr. Ellis remained a strong supporter of the CCF movement and later the New Democratic Party .
the Government of Canada has been working with all the other partners to facilitate the necessary agreements among all the players to allow the project to go forward in a proper manner .
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) :
i too would like to welcome on your behalf the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands as Deputy Speaker of the House .
Mrs. Maud Debien ( Laval East , BQ ) :
we realized some time ago that the Canada pension plan was not on very sound footing .
Ms. Val Meredith
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
the auditor general examined these three regional economic development programs and what he uncovered did not sound good .
this amounts to the biggest tax increase in Canadian history and is an enormous payroll tax hike .
we are going backwards in our quest for social justice and fairness .
it now has 1,512 residents .
hon. Allan Rock
the fund is proposed to be administered by an independent board that would be set up to receive such money , gifts or bequests and to determine awards on the basis of need .
standing COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRY
the women have it right .
i hope that person will jump up and include that as part of his speech .
maybe there is an explanation .
we see that the costs to business , consumers and taxpayers are excessive and unnecessary .
at the same time , I am certain that the Minister of Human Resources Development will be reviewing procedures in his department .
the changes to employment insurance were designed with that in mind .
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau , BQ ) :
i come from Atlantic Canada where many small businesses are struggling to survive .
Mr. Speaker , I listened with interest to the member for Kamloops .
we would appreciate hearing her and we would ask you to call some Reform Party members to order .
on the question as put , I do not know that a minister of the crown would necessarily know a member of a political party is involved one way or another .
Mr. Speaker , I want to make a brief comment because I know that many Canadians do watch the House .
many were aware of the need for the plan to be fixed .
i would also bring to the Speaker ' s attention the fact that the government House leader has brought forward a motion pursuant to Standing Order 78 ( 3 ) which is , as you know , predicated on the House leader ' s not being able to reach an agreement for the allocation of time for a stage of a bill .
as the Prime Minister stated in the throne speech debate at page 43 of Hansard :
those of us , including myself , who take natural health products , 25 percent of all Canadians and 34 percent of all Americans , cannot understand why this government continues in many cases to deny each one of us freedom of choice in the purchase and use of natural products which many of us have been consuming all of our lives and which people around the world have in some instances been consuming for 2000 years .
this year under this Prime Minister the Canadian public has created over 260,000 new jobs , the vast majority of those in the private sector .
that is why in the area of health care the Minister of Health reconfirmed in his speech of this morning that the government was committed to health care .
the only way we can do it is to come together as one people of one nation , through equality in order to make the changes required for the 21 st century .
even among government members there is discontent .
the economy is growing and we are leading the G - 7 .
if it is used to its ultimate , as I have said in this House many times before , it will not to be used at all .

the hon. member for Sherbrooke , a brief response .
the new national child benefit will help tear down this wall .
why was this legislation required ?
a government attempting to package and overmanage how Canadians participate in a global information explosion will at best deliver very costly , mediocre results .
Mr. Monte Solberg :
i can answer that question .
the throne speech talked about the new millennium fund of $ 1 billion to help low income people who want a post - secondary education , hopefully in the areas of science and technology .
i had both the authority as a member of Parliament and the written consent of the applicants to receive this information .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
they came and told us how much they loved us , spending all the money they wanted .
Mr. Peter MacKay
let us look at contributions received by the Bloc Quebecois .
they are trying to appeal to people who feel vulnerable at the moment .
let people spend it here so that new jobs will be created in the medical care system .
Mr. Roger Gallaway ( Sarnia - Lambton , Lib . ) :
when an individual has a secure job , all the other facets of their life fall into place .
i have mine right here .
Mr. Brent St. Denis
the reasoning is that because the government does not directly collect the tax one should not think of it as being a tax .
can you imagine what the Canadian people are saying ?
i would like to digress for a moment and speculate on the increase in support that was given to me because even though I was very pleased and honoured to be supported by about 56 percent of the electorate in the 1993 election , that grew to somewhere close to 67 percent on June 2 .
Mr. Speaker , who would think that I too would be a member of the perpetually humiliated club .
then we will have something to wave a flag about .
when members look back at the reports on which the present legislation is based , they will see that the government assumed the worst case economic scenario in terms of worst case interest rates , worst case inflation rates , worst case economic growth , worst case unemployment levels and so on .
the member for Saint John is only the 57 th Canadian to be inducted into the Order of Distinguished Auxiliary Service and the first person in Saint John .
however , we have no illusions about this , because when the Prime Minister talks about partnership , it is the kind of partnership in which the political decisions are made in Ottawa and the provinces are asked to carry them out .
amendment
moreover , you must always address the Chair .
it is critical that Quebeckers , especially francophone Quebeckers , understand the consequences and the implications of separation .
the leadership in Atlantic Canada recognizes it is a part of a larger community which is Canada .
that is exactly why I said yesterday that to make sure that everybody in Canada is equal we will put some of the money in the surplus to give a chance for students to go to university so they will be on an equal footing with the children of the rich people of Canada .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel :
we will invest in a wise , sensitive , significant way in science , innovation and technology to continue to be leaders of nations , and if we do not we will follow .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
i was also told that I probably should not waste my time trying to convert the Bloc Quebecois .
canada PENSION PLAN
Ms. Susan Whelan :
it is rather irrelevant .
that is what the Liberals are doing .
Mr. Speaker , the minister should know that when it comes to credibility , in my opinion , the auditor general ' s word is certainly as good as that of the Minister of Human Resources Development right now .
Mr. Peter Adams
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
thousands of our residents have benefited directly from the activities of the Kinsmen .
to justify the current surplus the Minister of Finance must be forecasting future unemployment in the 10 percent to 15 percent range , requiring a recession of immense proportion .
the Doras are named after the late Dora Mava Moore , a teacher and director who devoted her long life to creating theatre and theatre companies in Toronto .
we are hearing this all across the country .
we should not prolong or delay the deliberation of this bill .
first of all , I too have scoured the throne speech and I have yet to find the reference to the EH - 101 helicopters .
Mr. Preston Manning
it is a shame that the governments of Saskatchewan and British Columbia could not see it as the only viable way to guarantee the future of the Canada pension plan , a program I know they value as much as I do .
there are millions of such Canadian families penalized by the fact that the child care deduction is limited to double income families .
the government has listened and is responding to the needs and concerns of young Canadians .
Mr. Peter MacKay
in this House he represents a diminished Quebec , a Quebec that has been swept under the rug , a Quebec that they want to erase from the map , the francophones that they intend to extinguish sooner or later , and as far as they are concerned , the sooner the better .
hon. Sergio Marchi
where is the accountability ?
the annual interest bill is enough to pay the annual federal transfers to the provinces for health , education , welfare , equalization and old age security .
however , the board of directors , two - thirds of whom will be elected by farmers , would also be empowered to recommend changes that would result in a marketing system with some of the features of a dual market , if that is what producers want .
my second question , if she will be so kind as to address two of them , is with respect to internal trade barriers .
unfortunately he also lived to see the day when some of those dreams began to unravel as part of the policies adopted in recent years .
at no time are we asking the solicitor general or any member , any minister of the crown to actually interfere .
i spoke about an information highway for francophones , meaning all francophones in Canada .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :

i had the opportunity to work in a collaborative atmosphere with my council colleagues .

Mr. Speaker , what I was alluding to here is that the public has made a lot of sacrifices as we have balanced the budget , or we are close to balancing the budget .
as the guardian of the rights and privileges of this place , I implore you to give me along with others in this place the right to do our work .

i am sure many members have seen the headline on the front page of an edition of the Hill Times : " Pork barrel politics :

this scientific examination has confirmed that the passports are indeed forgeries and further that they were manufactured from materials not available in Canada .
we have already made a good start in this direction in the government ' s last mandate .
if they put a vote to the citizens of this country in terms of whether or not they want to see a doubling of their CPP , they know that would fail .
the only message sent to Quebec in this throne speech is that we should be satisfied with Canada as served up in Calgary , otherwise it will be Plan B .

i would like to talk about the department that just grew and grew .

introduction and first reading
Mr. Speaker , would you ask the minister to be quiet ?
what we are asking with this policy , with this bill , is not only that the federal government be the custodian but also the provinces .
it is not by spending money that we will cure the problems of the nation .
are we to understand from the Prime Minister ' s response that Mossad is authorized by the Canadian government to use Canadian passports for purposes other than terrorism ?

this is a service to more than 110,000 Canadian farm families .
miss Deborah Grey
your famous goal is part of what it truly means to be Canadian .
i flag this for the minister to suggest that we do have questions and that we may have suggestions to offer .
what is the optimal size of debt and what is the optimal level of taxes ?
they served around the world , but they also helped to defend Britain against invasion by air , warning of air raids and bombing attacks and thus helping the people of Britain through their darkest hour .
i guess the answer is tough luck .
the first point I want to make is that when we use the government ' s own projections we find that probably by the year 2001 or 2002 , which would be the end of its mandate , it will have a surplus of approximately $ 14 billion annually .
job CREATION
radar VETERANS REUNION
it is rather interesting to note that the party opposite has a void in its argument on the Canada pension plan debate and it was evinced by their void in not being here for the democratic vote .
i believe they ran , quite honestly and sincerely , in the last two federal elections on a commitment to increase employment , particularly for younger Canadians .
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY
they would very much like to expand and hire more people but this government continues to put barriers in their way to this type of job growth .
they go on to discuss the budget .
it is normal to some extent that we pay more .
that is critical and that is really what this debate is all about .
we were very clear in our fresh start platform document about precisely which programs we thought were priorities and those that we thought could be cut .
she states that while the industry committee ' s fifth report was tabled in the House on April 25 , 1997 , the Department of Industry ' s response to an access to information request shows that on April 18 , 1997 industry department officials were in possession of a preliminary draft of the report .
it is a bill that says Canadians have the right to know where their hard earned but easily spent tax dollars are going .
given the Liberals ' performance one can only assume that the Liberal definition of partnership means " you work , send us most of your wages and hey , we ' re partners '' .
the federal government must decide if it wants to continue forcing those lowest paid to pay personally for sexist discrimination by their employers or if it wants to end the discrimination today and honour the law on human rights .
but what does he propose ?
he was one of the most active members of the human resources development committee which I had the honour to chair in the last parliamentary session .
it is not the official responsibility in a portfolio for the minister to answer that on a political basis .
individual RRSPs would be funded by means of employee and employer payroll deductions .
not returning the annual surplus of approximately $ 7 billion in the employment insurance fund , and not telling workers and the unemployed about this surplus , is a clear misappropriation of funds .
( 15 ) to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Governmenrt Operations
freer trade has been positive for Canada .
i have the honour to lay upon the table the 1997 report of the privacy commissioner .
it may be a very new approach for some people , but when the federal government sees people with good ideas who get good results , it does well to borrow those ideas .
i can see that is obvious .
as it happens , his leader was sitting in the finance minister ' s seat , or very close to him , at the time .
we are aware of the existence of a code , but not of its contents .

the more income the fund generates within itself , the more dollars are available to keep the costs to the employee and employer down .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , once again , I have listened carefully to what the hon. member had to say , and like all her colleagues , she did not mention the people of Quebec ' s interest .
when the Quebec minister responsible for education , Pauline Marois , issued the notes for the press conference to introduce the bill she made reference to several objectives in it .

the majority of shareholders and stakeholders in agriculture do not want inclusion of those crops .
will the President of the Treasury Board inform the House whether this government intends to comply with the law and honour its obligations to women without resorting to legislation that would water down and diminish the rights of Canadians ?

Mr. Speaker , the Government of Canada is very concerned about meeting realistic , legally binding targets at the meeting we are to have in Kyoto , Japan , in December .
it is my hope that young Canadians will be able to benefit from this type of program for many years to come .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
under this government my 13 year old son will be middle aged before we get within shouting distance of that 5 per cent target .
investing in our children , investing in health , building safer communities , offering young Canadians greater opportunities , investing in knowledge and creativity , these are some of our government ' s priorities .
stimulating job creation and economic growth has been , remains , and will continue to be a major objective of the Government of Canada .
the petitioners go on to say that Canada is creating a bureaucracy to police parents and enforce the guidelines in a UN charter , a charter that has never been approved by Parliament .

we , in the Bloc Quebecois , have nothing against that , since , in Quebec , the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement - which dates back to 1964 , I think - has worked wonders and , moreover , fosters economic development .
we also need to remove some of the red tape on regulation that keeps our business people from concentrating on the product or the service they are selling .
the Liberals , the Reform and the Conservatives opposed it .
reformers are only wanting to represent the views of their own members and not of Canadians .
Mr. Jerry Pickard
we think those are major flaws .
Mr. Philip Mayfield
Mr. Paul Szabo : - and not in fact a letter from the Prime Minister ' s office which was within his role as the Prime Minister of Canada .
it is appointed directly by cabinet and serves at the pleasure of cabinet .
a very important tax planning point for all Canadians is that one spouse can split up to 50 percent of their Canada pension plan benefits with their spouse .
we are working very hard on the unemployment issue and you know it .
Mr. Michel Gauthier
( motion agreed to )
when we look at work and innovation and consider the circumstances facing indigenous communities , we know that the unemployment levels are upwards of 83 percent .
the answer is no .
Mr. Speaker , I found the speech very interesting , and I would like to commend the hon. member .
Quebeckers have always shared and espoused these values .
violent crime was something we read or heard about , tragic events that happened to others .
they voted on the advisory board .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Public Works .
will the Minister of Finance tell us today if his Liberal friends in the new Canada pension investment board will be subject to access to information guidelines ?
to return to Tuesday ' s speech from the throne , the government has revealed its political intentions .
( 19 ) to the Standing Joint Committee on Library of Parliament
it would have been better , Mr. Prime Minister , to have not had that section in the speech than to have it there with such a bare bones agenda .
it is important , especially after the international trade minister has spoken , to point out how much we are at a competitive disadvantage to other trading partners around the world .
i am very grateful for the opportunity to serve in such a distinguished setting as the House of Commons of Canada .
does he not feel like telling his government that it should act on the consensus reached by the ten provinces in Saint Andrews , where they asked for two things that were strangely similar to what the Bloc said in its campaign platform : a significant reduction in employment insurance premiums and improvements in the living conditions of seasonal workers and new labour market entrants ?
on the one hand we want to recognize that we no longer live in what can be called Christendom but on the other hand we do not want to accept that we will live with our schools under the illusion that there is no such thing as fundamental values , that there is no such thing as something in which everything we do has to be grounded .
i do not think everything we do will create better parents .
i want to talk a bit about the throne speech and what was in it for the people of Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac .
Mr. Bill Casey :
we defended the program -
in 1993 when I was elected , that was a very big concern .
what we in the Bloc Quebecois object to is that this is the Liberal government ' s tactic of smoke and mirrors , of doing anything to save face .
what we need are national standards for accessibility .
is that indeed what we are speaking of ?
customs
it had the good sense to re - elect Laurier for three more terms , a reasonable goal for any prime minister , it seems to me .
Mrs. Maud Debien ( Laval East , BQ ) :
it seems to me that if this were a priority of the government , it should at least have been mentioned in the throne speech .
they did not tackle the issue .
we have the highest number of people who can enrol in post - secondary education .
is this because they lack the imagination or lack the courage to leave their own backyard ?
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canadian children represent our country ' s future .
we have made them to sustain the plan to ensure it will be there for future generations .
we will not be involved in any smear campaigns .
the other side of the spending equation is investment .
the Speaker :
it is then with great pride that I come to Ottawa to represent this diverse yet typically Canadian part of Ontario .
arts AND CULTURE
to help those young Canadians who need a second chance , the Government will develop and expand community - based programs for youth with the greatest difficulty making the transition to the world of work because of low education and skills .
for every $ 1 billion worth of investment in Canada , 45,000 jobs over a five year period are created or sustained .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) :
there is a consensus among all those who have expressed their views on the issue .
one of the key blocks in our social safety net affecting every working Canadian is the Canada pension plan , so I would like to talk about it for a moment .
if the farmers right now who are in dire straits , and there are a lot of them with the price of wheat , are given the opportunity , if they are listened to , they would say " Please , in our democratic society of Canada give us the choice .
the leader of the Bloc Quebecois and the Premier of Quebec gave the example of the recent referendum in Wales , noting that 50 % plus one was enough .
for four years now , the Bloc Quebecois has been showing that there are other ways to arrive at the same result , a zero deficit , balanced budgets , without making the most disadvantaged members of society suffer .
in August when the justice minister was before the bar association she spent some time detailing her priorities for the coming session .
canada has rare strengths and enormous potential .
the son of the DIPP , the technology partnerships Canada program , is going to exactly the same people .
in the Speech from the Throne the government has indicated that the most important commitment is to keep Canada together .
i realize that this approach provides more flexibility to the government because it is easier to amend regulations .
allow me to reiterate the remark made by my hon. colleague from Mercier , who indicated that the Government of Canada and every province except Quebec should have taken Quebec ' s lead in 1964 - 65 when it established the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement .
Mr. Ghislain Fournier
comments DURING ORAL QUESTION PERIOD
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
the signing of this agreement is only two months away , yet the government refuses to divulge the standards to which Canada will agree .
in this respect we are doing what has already been done successfully in the province of Quebec .
given the complexity of the issues that face us as citizens in a global economy , collaboration is an essential ingredient for the success of Canada .
instead we have witnessed in four short years record low interest rates and low inflation , the restoration of public confidence in our finances , and the beginning of hope for the unemployed .
there are questions of compliance with the Ontario fire code , inventory lists , security , and locating a recycling plant near a hospital , schools and a high density residential area .
Mr. Pat O ' Brien ( London - Fanshawe , Lib . ) :
on the subject of the health protection branch , Canadians should not have to choose between a former employee who is critical and a minister who responds about what the health protection branch is doing .
Mr. David Pratt :
this constitutional amendment on linguistic school boards is considered a bilateral amendment in constitutional legalese .
did Ontario and Quebec give them up out of the goodness of their hearts ?
hon. Diane Marleau
i want to provide an overview of the direction my ministry will be pursuing to help protect the safety and security of Canadians .
food AND DRUGS ACT
i conclude that this is not a point of privilege only for me .
this has made it most difficult for the veterans and their families .
it can only be done by statute .
edited HANSARD * NUMBER 10
the Speaker :
i know that a substantial portion has been repaid .
rather , it is a framework that allows change to take place in an orderly and timely manner .
government ORDERS
hon. Christine Stewart
i am afraid to say it - and I think we are all aware of the fact - but there is a great deal of cynicism in the general public , a growing cynicism about political practices .
does she agree with her fellow member that millionaires pay too much in taxes , those poor Conrad Blacks , those poor Frank Stronachs ?
Canadians dislike intrusive government meddling in their personal affairs .
total tax reform means that we can get enough taxes from profitable businesses and corporations that can afford to pay their fair share and spread the money around .
as Speaker Fraser said , it is essential to our democratic system , and therefore essential for you , Mr. Speaker , to protect the opposition and delay even for one day the government from moving to close off debate in this manner .
it is already borrowing against future surpluses .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
it is in that spirit that I intend to contribute , in my limited capacity , to the reflection on the trust which must exist between the citizens and their elected representatives in a healthy democracy .
the work still has to be done .
the Speaker :
that is accountability .
Mr. John Cannis
today my father has a Visa card and my mother can use her Interac card to do her banking , even though they do not speak any English .
he was asked a question and he went on and on .
we in the House do not seem to think much about that .
she talked about the Shawinigan shakedown but the person who was eligible to receive the grant did not -
fourth , they said that it had to be affordable and sustainable for those future generations .
if any culture is truly unique and different within Canada , it is the Inuit culture .
our thanks to the volunteers and the organizations .
i do have to mention this to lead into my attack on the parliamentary system if we can call it that .
canada MARINE ACT
i am reminded of the words of Macdonald on the fate of our nation when he stated " whatever you do adhere to the union .
they do not want roads built through their traditional areas without considering the environmental and the long term impact it will have on their communities .
they voted and knew they were voting for 50 percent of every future surplus going back into strategic reinvestments and programs .
i doubt whether doubling the CPP would have passed a referendum vote .
throne SPEECH
we must do everything to guarantee our young people a better future .
we have made changes that will ensure the sustainability of the CPP into the 21 st century .
the minister ' s proposal is to increase this period to five years .
we have consulted with our members and we have acted on recommendations and have enshrined a better degree of accountability and communication measures between our PC Canada fund and the local constituency associations .
when the workers start to realize that their contributions have gone from $ 935 to $ 1,645 , we had better believe they are going to let people know and we better believe they will let the members across the way know .
this has been referred to already several times since the start of the 36 th Parliament .
the Speaker :
i believe we set out in the Speech from the Throne the way to do it .
the government could take concrete action immediately by reducing employment insurance premiums .
my hon. colleague in the Reform Party did not say anything about the throne speech , about the fact that we have stabilized health care funding or about the fact that we have given $ 850 million in a child tax benefit to poor families .
however , on February 25 , a date I want to come back to , what happened ?
* * *
will the minister assure the House that there will be no political interference in any resulting investigation , even though the federal government is a partner to the tune of $ 27 million in this agreement ?
current pensioners could have $ 2,000 per year less in after tax income due to the elimination of the age and retirement income credits .
a whole generation of our young people finish their studies without being rewarded with a decent job offer and find themselves strapped with a huge debt , $ 25,000 on average .
Mr. Speaker , let me first congratulate my hon. friend for being appointed as his party ' s spokesperson on international trade .
the House belongs to the people as so does the future of the country .
Mr. Bernard Bigras
throne SPEECH
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac , NDP ) :
it also kills their prospect for jobs today .
Mr. Chuck Strahl
the Deputy Speaker :
let no person in this House cast aspersions on the work ethic of the people of the South Shore .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) :
the government House leader has forgotten that number .
helping Canadians I believe is what the government is doing in the throne speech .
hon. Hedy Fry
Mr. Speaker , we have made a lot of decisions with respect to national unity .
hon. Christine Stewart
Joseph Maingot ' s Parliamentary Privilege in Canada , on page 71 states :
it is even more so today with the modern means of communications available .
some hon. members :
second , there are those who want to keep the Canadian Wheat Board essentially as it is or as it was .
certainly they have to understand that my riding is a major producer of wheat , there is no question about that .
i do not know if that was a question or a comment or an answer or all of the above .
i would also like to congratulate all those who were elected or re - elected , especially the new members who are here for the first time and who are about to experience something extraordinary .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
Mr. Paul DeVillers ( Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
given the government ' s commitment to openness and transparency , what will the minister do to respond to what the commissioner has called a festering silent scandal ?
the people in Bras d ' Or would like to send a clear message to the government that this type of treatment will not be tolerated .
what is missing from the bill is an itemized account of what we expect from this investment board when it presents its annual report .
throughout its history the Canadian Wheat Board has been governed by a small group of up to five commissioners , all appointed by the Government of Canada without any requirement that anybody be consulted and legally responsible only to the Government of Canada .
in the auditor general ' s report tabled today we find that the government sold Nav Canada for $ 1 billion less than its value .
they know what they are going to get and they got a choice .
that is obvious .
i would encourage you in the name of the House to please continue to keep the questions right on time and the answers also .
had I not believed that there was something good in this country to build upon , there would have been no inspiration there to pioneer the way for our children in order that they would have as equal if not a greater opportunity for success as their father has had .
introduction and first reading
then the hon. member for Calgary - Nose Hill spoke about the 200 percent return on investment that some of these people are receiving .
i come from Prince Edward Island and trade is extremely important .
almost 35 years ago in a reply to the throne speech Mr. Crouse talked about trade and its importance .
they want only to have strong support of families and safe communities in which to develop .
Mr. Speaker , every member of the Reform Party could go on and on at great length about the lack of real representation that has come from the opposite side of the House over the life that we have been here which is only one Parliament for most of us with the exception of our deputy leader .
the names of members eligible for the third ballot are as follows :
what was done in 1982 by members of Parliament from outside Quebec was not done in the face of the absence of a strong Quebec opinion that what we were doing was the right thing .
Canadians are both the beneficiaries and the stewards of a land that holds 9 % of the Earth ' s fresh water , 10 % of its forests , and 25 % of its wetlands .
employment
it is one of the few ridings in Canada that is bigger than my own .
now the government is asking us to approve the principles of these changes to the Canada pension plan .
Lesage felt that this co - ordination should normally take place through the board of directors .
i am aware of his commitment to international causes .
we will also expand information awareness and guidance related to career and job options and the skills required for them .
we are dealing with an amendment that will enable the province of Quebec , the country of Quebec - I should never use the words " Quebec " and " province " in the same sentence - to modernize its school system .
this is also the view of the Department of Finance and its advisers .
Mr. Speaker , the minister ' s answer in no way addresses the issue of what happened over the last 30 years .
the use of section 43 in this instance will allow all provincial governments to question the limits of their jurisdiction .
the Leader of the Opposition should never forget that six attempts were made to reform Quebec ' s school system .
it is necessary to remember that in order to achieve this vision for the future we must allow those blessed with the talent to reach for a higher calling , a higher destiny , on their own merit .
pursuant to section 25 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Parliament of Canada Act , I have addressed today my warrant to the Chief Electoral Officer for the issue of a writ for the election of a member to fill this vacancy .
what is he going to do to protect Canadians from the impact of this national postal strike ?
Mr. Speaker , when the leaders speak of course we do not want to be tight on time .
what are they to think when they see pertinent information being withheld from the Canadian Judicial Council , the one body entrusted to ensure that courts and judges remain independent of outside pressures so citizens can rely on the fact that they will receive fair and impartial hearings ?
we know from past experience that the Conservative government tried to balance the budget and in fact started to bring the deficit down and suddenly it turned around and became one of the biggest deficits we ever had .
access TO INFORMATION ACT
Mr. Speaker , we know that there is an investigation under way .
let us talk about fairness for a moment .
by electing a representative of the Bloc Quebecois , they have made sure that any threat to the democratic interests of the Quebec people will be condemned .
where are the bills and motions to strengthen the regional sensitivity and accountability of national institutions ?
some offenders must be imprisoned and in some cases for lengthy periods of time .
we need a separately managed Canada pension trust .
government ORDERS
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
CANADIAN PENSION PLAN
when he went to cash that $ 5,000 cheque , did he not smell a conflict of interest ?
it will only hire half of them in Canada .
the member for Kamloops agrees .
only with such an integrated , comprehensive system will we enable health care providers , administrators and governments to make evidence based decisions about the management and the delivery of health care .
ALGERIA
Mr. Eric Lowther
there is no stimulation in the economy by people who simply save and do not go out and spend .
i am very pleased to hear him talk about non - partisan issues .
members may be wondering today what the riding of Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac got from the Prime Minister in return for electing someone who is not from the area .
he was also afraid we would discover that recovery of 20 percent of the benefits combined with the current rate of taxation would result in a real rate of taxation of 60 percent for middle income seniors .
this is summed up best by Arthur Shafer in Peter Newman ' s The Canadian Revolution :
in addition to their general power to run all the affairs of the CWB and in response to specific recommendations from farmers , the directors will have the explicit authority to choose their own chairperson , to set the salaries of the directors , the chairperson and the president , to conduct regular performance appraisals on the president and to recommend his or her dismissal if thought necessary .
do you know what the people there are calling for , are demanding ?
* * *
the member may be referring to a particular group or interest lobby that held a meeting and came out with those other conclusions .
they yell out from the NDP side that the truth hurts .
Mr. Speaker , I have three petitions .
the Deputy Speaker :
Mr. Roy Cullen :
we are not starting from ground zero .
Mr. Paul Forseth
John Solomon for Bill Blaikie
we are not asking , as is claimed across the floor , that we should let those who have live in comfort at the expense of those who have not as much .
money LAUNDERING
i am quite positive the members in this House are very aware that consultation on the Canada pension plan has been ongoing for well over a year .
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( St. Catharines , Lib . ) :
i disagree .
the Reform Party will have its position , as will the NDP .
i know I would .
again yesterday , Mr. Bouchard spoke before 500 world business leaders , and a few minutes later some 30 economic agreements with a total value of $ 170 million were signed between French and Quebec businesses .
if we analyse the throne speech and dissect such phrases as " public - private sector partnerships " we should have a grave concern that the Liberals plan to not only continue funding these outdated programs , but actually plan to increase the number of tax dollars to these programs .
three years ago in Miami , the concept of a free trade zone of the Americas seemed a far off dream .
of what value are those remaining ICBMs in their silos and an aging nuclear powered submarine navy if one ' s economic house is not in order ?
( n ) Natural Resources and Government Operations ( sixteen Members ) ;
* * *
i remind hon. members to address both the questions and the answers to the Chair .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for Stoney Creek for his speech .
we do not want to find ourselves slipping back into the position we were in which robbed us of any flexibility in this last decade or so .
we have to deal with the facts .
we will be preserving and enhancing medicare .
less than 24 hours after the Tobacco Act was passed and on the eve of the last election campaign , the Prime Minister partially recognized his mistake and promised to amend the legislation so as to remove certain restrictions on international racing event sponsorships .
i did not understand everything the hon. member said , but I think the deficit he is talking about was created by the Liberals .
they would really appreciate a tax break .
British Columbia will host APEC meetings for 18 world leaders and their ministers in beautiful Vancouver .
Quebeckers will never agree to be satisfied with the " lesser of two evils '' , much less with the alternative , which we all realize consists in making Quebec go along with the centralist vision of the Liberals and give up its historical expectations .
is it really the prerogative of government to make that kind of decision ?
recent surveys show that the vast majority of Quebecers want to stay in Canada .
the Saguenay and Manitoba floods have not only left their mark on the geography of those regions .
auditor GENERAL ' S REPORT
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay :
Mr. Eric Lowther
emphasis will also be placed on those factors that determine the health of a country ' s population , including the equality of economic and social opportunity for all citizens .
i just want to say thank you , Lew .
the Liberal game of TAGS has left fishermen holding the bag .
now we are taking the challenge of securing the future of the Canada pension plan .
madam Speaker , on June 2 Canadians were consulted .
they also told us they wanted to see some changes .
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
second , it misses a golden opportunity to allow them to get the best pension return possible for each dollar paid into the plan .
we are not here to pit Canadians against each other because of the difference in their age or the difference in their income level .
like most Canadians , I continue to have hope that each new Parliament will be an improvement but fear that we will again be disappointed when our government proceeds for political reasons rather than for the best interest for Canadians .
criminal CODE
like many Canadians and Quebecers , the Conservative senator is dissatisfied with the status quo and realizes that the federal government , whether Conservative or Liberal , is totally incapable of reforming and renewing the Canadian Constitution .
these men and women of the Royal Canadian Air Force operated and maintained these never sleeping , ever - vigilant eyes of freedom .
Mr. John Bryden
i was wondering if at the beginning of this Parliament he would assure us that he would agree with that statement .
if the prime minister is not playing a shell game , if he wants to make himself different from Mulroney , then why does he not pass the bulk of any surplus on to Canadian taxpayers ?
i take my duties to them very seriously and want to do a good job of representing their interests and of being their voice in these debates .
many questions remain unanswered , and because my time is running out , I would like to mention them before concluding .
Mr. Grant Hill
Mr. Inky Mark
we brought it under control .
Mr. Speaker , through you I would like to point out right off that the Minister of Industry recently aroused my sympathy and that of a number of my colleagues when he said the monarchy should be abolished .
in its speech , the government is inviting us to take part in a great debate on the post zero deficit age .
that is exactly what hon. members will not talk about as they go about their riding consultations , that they enjoy parliamentary privileges and that they will have their legal bills paid for by the House of Commons , yet they will not even extend part of that same privilege to anybody else .
he also claims that as a member of Parliament he is entitled to confidential information .
i was always appreciative of his practicality and his common sense when it came to addressing the issue .
labour
i am pretty much satisfied that the majority of Quebeckers are proud to be Canadians as well .
as we approach the new millennium any rules that permit the appointment of any representatives are archaic and should be forever consigned to the 19 th century , not to the 21 st century .
in my view it is important that the government continue to focus on agreements like the auto pact , to give them support and strength so that we will have more employment , more prosperity and therefore a better quality of life in Windsor , Tecumseh , St. Clair Beach and in the province of Ontario generally .
Mr. Speaker , if I were a member from Ontario I think I could stand up here and boast about the economy of my home province , but unfortunately I am not from Ontario .
any successful business operator or economic adviser will say that in order to succeed one should identify that which one does best and then do it better than anyone else .
could the Speaker rule whether the question was in order ?
i am still , however , trying to find out exactly where the government stands on this issue .
it was a con job all along .
from now on , only five members of the board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board will be appointed by the Governor General in Council , the ten others will be elected democratically by the grain growers as a whole .
Mr. John Harvard
one of these priorities is security of retirement for all Canadians , and more especially , the restoration of the Canada pension plan .
i was born into a family of seven boys and can attest to the fact that co - operation is far easier to preach than to practise .
as the member sticks to the rhetoric of the campaign , and as my neighbour we share such different views , would he acknowledge that perhaps the reason his party is in fifth position is because Canadians have seen the dramatic results of irresponsible tax cuts that have taken place in Ontario and have resulted in dramatic and drastic cuts to programs which impact on the quality of life .
we are not dealing with an amendment that is going to change the balance between communities , between francophones and anglophones .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
the CPP fund , which currently has the equivalent of two years of contributions , will now have a reserve equivalent to five years of contributions .
i think a great effort must be made to keep that in mind .
Mr. Claude Drouin ( Beauce , Lib . ) :
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
i have never had a temporary job here like the Leader of the Opposition .
Mr. Rick Laliberte
we must add to that a mutual respect for our similarities and our differences .
Mr. Speaker , I will avail myself of your kind invitation to clarify what I said a bit earlier .
there is no model for it anywhere .
but because of a profligacy in the Congress , the deficit did increase .
madam Speaker , the hon. member obviously was not listening to my speech .
it is difficult to put into words my feelings as I was recently sworn in , for the second time , as a member of this esteemed Chamber .
give us a chance '' .
Mr. Speaker , I think the question that the hon. member from the Bloc is asking was in effect answered by this House and this caucus on Thursday last when we voted against the Bloc amendment .
and since this government is extremely vague about its intentions and would rather not discuss its far from outstanding record in this area , I would like to recall some of the main points .
hon. Jean J . Charest :
i know that this is the first day and I will give us all a bit of leeway .
i ask my colleagues once again , when we are making tributes , when we are asking or answering questions , or when we are debating in the House , that we give each other the respect that is due a member of the Canadian Parliament .
i appreciate that there is a reasonable delegation from the member ' s party also .
as I listen to members opposite , particularly members of the Reform Party , it becomes more clear that we are dealing with two very fundamentally different visions not only of the Canada pension plan but of the country .
the most effective way to stem youth crime is not always tougher sentencing , corporal or capital punishment , but by preventing young people from falling into a life riddled with criminal activity .
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian
it will not be the same when we look toward you , Mr. Speaker , and do not see Mr. Knowles sitting at the table as honorary clerk , as the proceedings unwind .
canada PENSION PLAN
he did not ask about the deficit .
you may rely on the Bloc Quebecois to make of Quebec a people who are open - minded , tolerant and generous , and not an ethnic group , as certain people would have us believe .
yet I believe it is very important to understand that most people of our generation would appreciate and would applaud what this government is doing today .
since that time the government has failed to respond even though a report from the human rights commission indicated that those workers were entitled to fair pay for equal work .
during cross - Canada consultations Canadians told us they wanted the Canada pension plan to run like a private pension plan .
the Government will work with other partners and Aboriginal communities to
with all the new Ontario members in this House , surely in caucus they must have been looking for an open invitation from the federal government to develop a co - ordinated fiscal policy to sustain the economic recovery in Ontario .
Tuesday shall be an allotted day .
this means that by the year 2003 an additional $ 3,270 must come out of the pockets of small business owners based on the proposed figures .
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea .
she returned home and her passport was lost .
Mr. Speaker , my supplementary question is for the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board .
another question is will the CPP be there for me when I retire .
it outlined how the legislation would obey the charter .
i believe it is important to set limits within which science can develop in the service and the best interests of all .
division No. 4
there are a lot of children in North Dartmouth and I think 99 percent of them were there that day , but the lives of many of the Dartmouth children and families are far from perfect .
Mr. Alex Shepherd :
Ron is a Canadian who has been in Jordan for the past six months on important personal business .
Mr. Connell also told the panel that his seven years of benefits from the CPP were $ 54,287 , about five times more than he put in .
we believe that the federal government will have enough influence by its appointment of one - third of the 15 members of the board of directors .
he served in Britain and France , going into France on D - Day .
how can we ever avoid going that way again ?
because my allotted time is ending , I will wrap up , Mr. Speaker .
the north is not a place where the rich come to exploit the lands of the people and take back the profits .
madam Speaker , perhaps I may finish the name of my riding , which is Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , representing its four regional county municipalities .
* * *
Mr. Speaker , in addition to the problems we have as private members , during the clause by clause amendment of Bill C - 68 , a large controversial bill , we were unable to get the services we required to draft amendments .
therefore it is not with indifference that we should welcome this day but rather with a deep satisfaction .
the CPP legislation was designed some 30 years ago .
according to Richard Cacchione , president of ADM , the federal government is refusing to withdraw from the Montreal airports for political reasons .
my comment is that in order to stimulate the economy , we had to get that deficit down , slay that $ 42 billion dragon .
are those the programs he wants eliminated too ?
justice
i am treated as a boy scout .
our fine Prime Minister , the member for Saint - Maurice , propelled this judge into a seat on the supreme court and it will be this judge who decides on Quebec ' s right to sovereignty .
rather than creating these kinds of difficulties through Bill C - 2 , we believe the government would be better advised to spend its time correcting the problems which already exist in the Canada pension plan rather than creating new problems .
Mr. Speaker , I have tried to explain in a few words that we must have the basic elements to create jobs in the country .
this committee has interpreted consensus to mean unanimity .
this measure is a carbon copy of Bill C - 72 , which was introduced during the last session of the 35 th Parliament .
if the Reform Party were really sincere in all it says , it should have done this long ago .
speech FROM THE THRONE
small business , especially a small business that is involved in international trade , is going to be and should be the engine of job growth in this country .
i came to you , bearing my country ,
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
one of those benefits is the low interest rates , the lowest rates in 30 years .
lastly I want to turn to the never ending subject of national unity .
in truth the corporations control 70 percent of the total allowable catch .
the provision was fair for those people .

i am very proud of their maiden speeches and I must say their careers are definitely off to a good start .
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua ( Vaughan - King - Aurora , Lib . ) :
we go to Charlottetown and we are not at united Canada yet .
we abide by that code as well .
he talks about super RRSPs which are mandatory .
all those opposed will please say nay .
can the Reform Party make the same commitment ?
we face a crisis in Cape Breton that has been building for 40 years .
we never have enough time to talk about all the things that we should talk about , but this whole phrase " allowing for the abuse of legislation for federal political parties that can in fact misuse and abuse the trust of the Canadian public '' .
forty - one thousand dollars for one campaiagn , under " other organizations '' .
that means it jeopardizes the safety of those Canadian travellers as well .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , the hon. member for Notre - Dame - de - Gr 芒 ce accused Lucien Bouchard of being against bilingualism .
what that means is today we have six provinces that have this constitutional protection .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order to seek advice and help from you .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
the government must take steps to keep spending under control .
* * *
we need a real commitment of leadership from the government to help students today with financial assistance and a flexible program that will relieve the debt load .
in short , the legislation before us will address a range of crucial objectives for ensuring that Canadians will be able to look toward their retirement years with greater confidence and security .
we must continue to look abroad to market our excellent competitive Canadian products .
the same applies to the Soci 茅 t 茅 qu 茅 b 茅 coise du d 茅 veloppement de la main - d ' oeuvre , which is also involved ; it does not consider that to be public information .
Mr. Speaker , the need to replace our aging and unreliable search and rescue helicopters was established over four years ago .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
although they are irresponsible and dangerous , the threats of the partition and hacking - up of Quebec are not the real problem .
the Governor General spoke of a country in control of its finances , ready to reinvest in its society and optimistic about its future .
that explanation has been made in full .
- we demonstrate a profound disrespect for our children .
we have also made a commitment to do more to see that Canadians with disabilities play a larger role in our economy .
the hon. member referred to distinct realities in the case of Quebec , etc.
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
second , I would like him to know that , in this House , we are elected to represent all the people in our riding and all the people of Quebec , be they federalist or separatist .
all those opposed will please say nay .
some hon. members :
it is unrealistic to expect people to take part in a referendum process for such issues .
here are other initiatives the government may want to consider .
it is only with the facts that we will finally be able to address the inequities .
we are everywhere or almost in the Quebec area .
i suggest that this Liberal government should be giving thanks to the millions of Canadian taxpayers who have been taking all the hits over the last three and a half years as the Liberals have attempted to dig themselves out of this massive financial pit that they along with the Tories , cheered on by the NDP , have created for Canadians .
Mr. Speaker , surely the prime minister knows that he is alone in this position .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
i also wish to take this opportunity to thank the workers in my constituency who worked hard for me , those who put up signs and made political contributions to my campaign .
the hon. member for Qu ' Appelle .
the Liberals refer to the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency as the MLLM , money for loyal Liberal maritimers .
sixth , how can we change the spending patterns of government to better reflect the priorities of Canadians ?
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to christen this new bench in the House of Commons , close to the bar .

we have been able to temper that debt over the last four years by something under $ 600 million .
the hon. member for Yukon .
the Speech from the Throne set the foundation for an exciting and fulfilling term .
i would like to ask the member to explain in detail just exactly how it is that this is going to happen when the premiums go up to about 9.9 percent , and I believe that is supposed to last forever .
BRITISH COLUMBIA
only then can we increase our competitive edge with our trading partners , notably the U.S. , having economic growth and employment growth in this country .
we understand very well that as the plan grows , matures and things change that we do have to deal with that .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
it is despicable to present things as if the government was handing out goodies when in fact it is merely cutting somewhat less than anticipated in 1996 , but with the same slash - and - burn approach .

my bill closes this loophole by providing that any act or omission committed outside Canada , which if committed in Canada would constitute an offence under the Criminal Code , shall be deemed to have been committed in Canada if the perpetrator is a Canadian citizen , a permanent resident or is present in Canada after the commission of the act .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to judiciously say that on March 5 the minister for HRD sent a letter and asked the police to investigate illegal fundraising .
hon. Paul Martin
the tax burden is being carried by working people and by middle income people .
those who put their trust in me and voted for me last June I thank from the bottom of my heart .
let me share with the House the key themes .
under the partially vested plan , the provinces will no longer be able to borrow money at the same rate at which they borrow it now to invest in their infrastructure for schools , universities and hospitals .
fifty four per cent of federal spending cuts were made in social programs .
Jim represents our support for the arts , which was announced in the Speech from the Throne .
perhaps the member missed it .
we also have to acknowledge the fact that one out of five seniors is living in poverty .
during the past ten years the FCM , in partnership with the Canadian International Development Agency , implemented international programs which have facilitated exchanges of municipal expertise between elected officials , staff and counsellors throughout the world from Canadian municipalities and their counterparts from Africa , Latin America , Asia and central Europe .
we would like to have copies of all the decisions .
madam Speaker , since this is my first formal speech in this 36 th Parliament , I would like to thank you and congratulate you on your appointment .
i will give two examples .
there was a change in it which changed it from a five - year to a four - year program .
QUEBEC BY - ELECTIONS
although he was a long time resident of Regina , the city he represented in the House of Commons , Mr. Ellis was born in Weyburn , Saskatchewan , the son of Bill Ellis and Peggy Dawson Gibson .
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate my colleague from British Columbia on a wonderful speech .
rest assured that the only leader with a vision of the future for Canada is the man you heard yesterday , Jean Charest , and the true opposition which can speak on behalf of all Canadians is the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to introduce this private member ' s bill .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to praise my distinguished colleague , the young member for T 茅 miscamingue , for his skill as a speaker .
the head of Business Council on National Issues agrees with him : " This agreement places Canada at the forefront of industrialized nations with problems linked to an aging population '' .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his comments and questions .
in Canada over the last three years 70 per cent to 80 per cent of new jobs were created by small and medium size businesses .

i was interviewing a candidate in my office , a Tamil woman .

* * *
the suggestion that is being made here is that when people spend money is disappears .
madam Speaker , I thank the hon. member for her presentation .
without offending the Bloc members , it was a unique experience to enter the House of Commons for the first time a week ago today .
statements BY MEMBERS
Mr. Speaker , I would like to convince you that it is a point of privilege and support my colleague in that manner .
i hope the limited mention of natural resources in the Speech from the Throne was simply an oversight and not a continuation of the Liberals ' traditional lack of attention to the important role of natural resources in the Canadian economy .
the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police expressed the need for this bill in light of the epidemic of car thefts used to commit a crime .
this promise left me very sceptical , naturally .
we are appointing an arm ' s length independent science advisory board to offer its views about whether we have it right and let Canadians know whether we are doing the job properly .
on the contrary , we offered , during these negotiations , over $ 1.3 billion .
the Minister of Transport has the floor .
this little card refers to exactly what this plan is all about .
i have one underlying question .
Mr. Paul Mercier ( Terrebonne - Blainville , BQ ) :
canada PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD
if it is not based on merit then this thing is going to be a very useful educational tool because it means the young people will be taught at a very early age how to work the system the Canadian way .
who better to consult on any subject , including national unity .
when the public has regained faith in its public institutions , we will have the stability and confidence necessary to move forward .
in frustration and fear my constituents are pressing politicians for change and I hear them .
Mr. Mark Assad ( Gatineau , Lib . ) :
we have to fight against that .
the federal , provincial and territorial governments agreed in January 1997 to work together to develop the National Children ' s Agenda , a comprehensive strategy to improve the well - being of Canada ' s children .
i do not think -
but as Canadian members of Parliament our first duty is to make sure of the safety of our citizens , which means protecting the good reputation of our passport everywhere in the world , every day of the week , every month of the year .
Mr. John Cannis
we will give him the benefit of the doubt .
the CPP and the OAS have been particularly important for lower and middle income seniors .
our youth are the future of Canada , which is why the government is committed to the national child benefit system announced this past spring .
when they can get mustard , canola and soya , all of these commodities , that is where they are going .
we have worked hard for four years to bring Canada ' s finances to the point where we can begin to plan new initiatives .
these are the results of consultations with Canadians .
does he wish to reconsider his position ?
i also thank my volunteers , for had it not been for their support and commitment the excellent result we achieved would not have happened .
our personal income tax rate is 52 percent higher than the rest of the G - 7 nations and 25 percent higher than the industrialized countries in the OECD .
Mr. Speaker , when will the minister tell the House where these passports are ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
national UNITY
all that seems reasonable .
in relation to the Speech from the Throne I would like to perform these two functions .
Mr. Dennis J . Mills :
i am particularly honoured and proud to have been given this task .
there is a third choice , that of a renewed Canadian federation .
let us compare their record to ours .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to be able to participate in the debate today on such an important issue for Canadians .
as soon as we got the information we acted directly .
Mr. Jean Dub 茅
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal
that is far different from what the Minister of Canadian Heritage will get with the $ 2.8 million pension she will collect by the time she turns 75 , or the $ 3.4 million that Brian Tobin , who is now collecting money as the Premier of Newfoundland , will get .
contents
since the prime minister will not move , will the Minister of Finance accept the recommendations of the auditor general and table here in the House of Commons the analysis on which he bases the premium rate ?
what they are hoping is that people are going to forget it , but I do not think that is going to be the case .
we categorically reject any notion that there was collusion between the government of Canada and any other government .
Mr. Speaker , I listened with attention to my colleague ' s remarks and there are two points I want to raise with him .
the victory was sweet because apart from the Liberal campaign that was run in the riding of York South - Weston in an attempt to unseat the sitting member there , I would say that the campaign run by the Liberals in my riding was probably one of the dirtiest and sleaziest in recent history .
before suspending the sitting I bring to the attention of the honourable members that when the counting has been completed , the bells to call the members back to the house will be sounded for not more than five minutes .
Mr. Speaker , in 1992 the Mulroney government passed the debt servicing and reduction act .
is he aware of any of these things as he continually stands in his place and brags about the wonderful things they have accomplished for the aboriginals as things steadily get worse ?
it was amended back in the 1980 s when I was part of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador .
that is not undue interference .
they are participating in the economy .
carvings and crafts are a legitimate source of income to many families in the north and are relied upon to put food on the table .
the Deputy Speaker :
i always thought culture was the nourishing element of a people .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal
i should point out to the House that at this stage the negotiators are still negotiating what they are going to negotiate .
Mr. Speaker , my colleague from Edmonton knows that other people have seen the passports and that is why I have said we have not seen the passports .
in addition , the ministers of finance and human resources development will prepare an annual report on the CPP which will include the financial statements of the CPP investment board as well as the report of the auditor general on those statements .
however , at the same time the federal government had trouble letting go .
hon. Christine Stewart
can the prime minister tell this House if he really thinks that government spending , investments as they are called , like spending $ 72,000 on something called a mystery shopping program is more important to Canadians than tax relief ?
second , we have certainly experienced quite a few difficulties over a period of time .
it would appear that protecting the financial interests of families may be more important that protecting government abilities to fund programs .
please tell me what you are going to do for our people ?
( the House divided on the amendment , which was negatived on the following division : )
Mrs. Monique Guay :
i hope that is clear .
what would we do ?
in last week ' s Speech from the Throne the government noted that it will continue to take further action to encourage new investments , to create new jobs and to generate the national wealth necessary to assure Canadians a stable and secure future .
yet there is no legislation at the present time to reflect that desire .
the Speaker :
a bill that I wished to have in that draw was not eligible because it has not gone through first reading yet .
if we are ever to resolve Canada ' s unity problem we have to make significant changes to the way Canada is governed .
predominantly Anglo - Saxon 30 years ago , my riding has benefited from the arrival of many new Canadians who have brought with them not only their skills and their talents but their hopes and dreams for a better life in the best country in the world .
in that essay she encourages Canada ' s leading edge technology , the importance of working together as a nation , the importance of educating our youth and the importance of our health care system to us all .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
i would argue that the Reform Party has done that in spades over the last few weeks by offering not only a discussion paper on some of the alternatives to what we could do with the surplus but to inform the debate and start a consultation process .
the House met at 10 a.m.
when I had people working for me they liked to maintain some form of standard of living .
second , the Speech from the Throne underscores that to take full advantage of these opportunities we must expand our trade base further .
the correct word is investment .
statements BY MEMBERS
Mr. Steve Mahoney ( Mississauga West , Lib . ) :
Mr. Stan Dromisky
Ted Thompson and Chief Justice Isaac committed one of the most serious breaches of judicial interference ever experienced in this country .
did these parties not predict when the Liberals were elected in 1993 that there would be more of the same ?
i am talking about asking for cash donations , which cannot be traced .
some people will always raise some regional frustrations that exists in parts of Canada , but it is important to look at the whole situation .
if we do not , our customers are certainly going to be looking elsewhere .
special JOINT COMMITTEE
that seems to be part of its agenda as well , although I have not heard much about it in this parliament .
the government will also work with the business community and the provinces to forecast areas of job growth .
you can care about the people and still make tough decisions knowing that what you are doing will be better for all the regions of the country .
in addition , the industry portfolio has been working to realize our international potential .
it is unfortunate .
hon. Don Boudria
it is just not true .
middle class workers cannot afford to pay more for the same benefits .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
the Conservatives made it grow twofold from 1984 to 1993 . Since 1993 , the Liberals have been at it again and , as a result , it has now reached $ 620 billion .
why would anybody carry on with a brand new program like this when medicare itself needs to be fixed ?
call in the members .
does the Prime Minister not find it indecent to appoint to the highest court in the country a former colleague , someone very close to him , someone close to the Liberal Party of Canada , someone who co - chaired the national committee for the yes side during the referendum on the Charlottetown accord ?
the government will soon have a budget surplus .
he knows that there have been two international airports in Montreal since 1975 .
i wish to submit the following points for consideration .
that is the reality if they are saying not to renew it or not to do what needs to be done to improve the plan .
it will let the Canadian public know that we have a serious problem in this country with passports , how they are inspected and how they are used .
we are confident that we can work toward ensuring that as many Canadians as possible have the necessary skills to get the jobs opening up in high tech areas .
fisheries
i was there as a concerned Canadian .
the contributions for this plan under the government ' s proposal would be nearly doubled over five years , yet the return for people just entering the plan would be less than 2.5 percent and that is according to the government ' s own actuaries .
quite frankly , I believe hon. members opposite want to weaken it because they know it is a darned good Liberal innovation and it will strengthen our resolve in western Canada .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
points OF ORDER
may I reaffirm to the voters of my riding of Etobicoke Centre my solemn commitment to devote all of my energies to their service in the coming years .
Mrs. Sue Barnes
they are not really about democracy .
Mr. Jean Dub 茅 :
i appreciate the fact that the government in power has a very difficult issue facing it today .
Mr. Speaker , I am aware of the news reports this morning about a file being asked for by an official at Health Canada .
however our society needs both sustenance and a hope to go forward .
if you want us to stay in the Canada pension plan , like all the people in my riding have told me , then you have to implement reforms to make that happen .
a very powerful consensus exists in Canada for governments to balance their books and get their priorities right .
i find it somewhat ironic in the sense that in New Zealand it was a labour government which was elected a number of years ago to clean up the fiscal mess which the previous conservative government had created .
the solicitor general was involved in a one year task force which made recommendations to the government .
the member from the Bloc raised some of the concerns that the Government of Quebec has with respect to any postponement beyond the date .
even some federalist Liberal organizers say it is an empty shell .
he noted that barriers to trade are coming down worldwide and that Canada is very dependent upon trade .
this new project will help to create nearly 200 jobs in Ahuntsic .
Mr. Speaker , with regard to the funding of any group , we always have clear criteria .
madam Speaker , I note with the background of the member who just spoke that she probably exemplifies where we are in Canada , which is that indeed Canada is made up of all those in Canada , not just those from the so - called two founding nations .

the amendments to the act do not affect all present retirees as well as those on disability or who have survivor benefits .
government CONTRACTS
how has the government responded to this crisis ?
* * *
in fact , if our country is so widely respected throughout the world , it is partly because of its respect for this heritage that generations of Canadians have preserved over the years .
apparently the program is designed partly by officials in the Department of Human Resources Development and partly by a number of focus groups under the direction of a political consulting firm .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
secondly , surpluses should go to job creation through a targeted reduction in payroll taxes .
Mr. Thibault told the media a few hours ago that he has never heard of the company Videon .
hon. Sergio Marchi
you get the envelope , you get the letter and you put the letter together .
is there some mechanism which the Liberal government has in mind to guarantee that taxes will not be raised and to give Canadians relief from the taxation which is killing us economically and destroying the social fabric of the lives of so many families ?
hon. Sergio Marchi ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) :
it is now doing more harm than good .
Mr. Monte Solberg
as Mr. Lesage said :
certainly he has not been studying the legislation .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib . ) :
we now have thousands of people in my community who are unemployed or underemployed and undervalued .
or does he mean , as they have always said , that the issue will be sorted out within Quebec , following formal resolutions from the rest of Canada ?
it was a Conservative government which looked very closely at the New Zealand model in order to learn from that experience .
in other cases it may mean that we will have to lower taxes .
that is the necessity to live by the rule of law and that the law should not be just slightly changed because of the whims of certain individuals .
i declare the subamendment lost .
the member rose and pretended to be offended by our comments , but I wonder if , in fact , the Liberal Party does not agree .
young workers are starting their families and careers , undertaking the major financial commitments of their lives while trying to make ends meet .
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD
Mr. Speaker , we are very pleased to hear that it is not up to the Prime Minister to decide how the provinces are to conduct their business .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
the hon. member for Burin - St.
because that is a part of the fibre of Canada .
CALGARY DECLARATION
i continue to repeat that because it is important for Canadians in the galleries , for Canadians watching on TV and for Canadians in our constituencies .
something interesting was pointed out in the 35 th Parliament which I am sure we are going to see repeated in the 36 th Parliament .
i think not .
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
the opposition should refrain from tarnishing the reputation of people who may be innocent and should wait for the investigation to be completed .
bill C - 207 .
if I do receive other information , I will advise my hon. colleague as soon as possible .
secession is not a right within a democracy .
call in the members .
i would also like to take time to thank the voters of South Surrey - White Rock - Langley for allowing me to continue as their member of Parliament .
however despite their best efforts this happens every year and even more so at the beginning of a new Parliament or a new session .
surely all members of the House would recognize that each of us deals with people in the circumstances that the member has referred to in our activities as members of Parliament and each of us is moved by those stories .
finally , there are a lot of concerns across western Canada about the timely and efficient movement of grain to market .
this initiative will give Canadians greater confidence in their pension system .
is that not the question ?
it is a problem which mortgages the future , especially the future of younger generations .
how do you make $ 1 million in Canadian business ?
we are dealing with an environmental , political and technological problem that leaves no room for improvisation .
although I am away from the riding of Beaver River because the electoral boundaries commissioners blitzed that riding in the last election , it was a tremendous honour for me to sit here for several years on their behalf .
bill C - 211 .
that is the basic and sole purpose of this amendment .
i find it very ironic and kind of sad that they would stand and talk about Reform ' s plan when obviously they have never read it .
today during question period questions were raised concerning the access of the personal and confidential files of Dr. Michelle Brill Edwards .
are we giving money to an organization , where there have been published reports of connections to a terrorist organization in Sri Lanka , without doing an audit to ensure that organization in no way is funding with any of its money the terrorist organization in Sri Lanka ?
this was an interesting year for those of us who live in Manitoba .
recently Constable Wayne Hummell of the Guelph police force was awarded a Canadian banks law enforcement award for his efforts in combating crime against banks .
there is no accountability in the transportation system in the wheat transportation business .
any profits that come to the management of that independent body will go back into the fund .
Mr. Speaker , I am here today speaking on the Speech from the Throne that this government gave to the country outlining the government ' s policies and the government ' s priorities leading into the next millennium .
first , I wish to congratulate you on your appointment as assistant deputy chairman of committees of the whole House , and I also want to take a few moments to thank the voters of Louis - H 茅 bert for putting their trust in me , and also the numerous volunteers without whose support I would not be here today .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
this government works on a few assumptions .
reform is urging the government to move toward giving Canadians ownership of their own pension contributions and restoring the belief , especially of younger Canadians , that the plan will deliver decent retirement security for reasonable contributions .
war CRIMINALS
the hon. member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot .
Mr. Speaker , I also move :
it is interesting when we think about it that they are the same so - called lazy people he so proudly came to beg for support to get his one way ticket to Ottawa .
many areas in justice should have been addressed in the throne speech but were not .
i have great optimism and I believe there has been a variety of versions of history frequently dependent on the author .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand
Quebec , no less than the other provinces , flourishes within our federation and it will continue to do so in the future .
how is it that the Minister responsible for the Treasury Board estimates that this information can be made public , that it is normal for it to be released ?
we must all contribute to helping young people take their rightful place in society .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
he never consulted with us .
through a combination of personal income tax relief measures , increases in personal and spousal exemptions , changes to the child care tax benefits , reductions in EI premiums , surtaxes and capital gains taxes , we can take about 1.3 million Canadians off the federal tax rolls altogether , including 300,000 seniors .
justice
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
i was interested in the remarks of the Conservative member who referred to including certain types of grain .
in the context of cuts Quebec has been forced into by the federal government , this election of October 6 is a great victory , and a tie between the parties .
they are saying forget about the way they have mishandled the pension contributions of working Canadians to the point that now seniors who are existing on the Canada pension plan are so far below the poverty line with the pittance they get from Canada pension that they cannot even see the poverty line it is so far above them .
this needs to be repeated over and over in the presence of separatists .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
the commissioners identify that it is no longer acceptable for us to continue in a paternalistic way , to provide only programs that create dependency .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his comments and his question .
of that 6 percent only half of that is from social programs .
she said that her priorities were changes to the Young Offenders Act , that she would toughen it up and make it tighter .
all those in favour of the subamendment will please say yea .
there were many points in his speech which I agreed with .
i am now prepared to deal with the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre on October 1 relating to the premature disclosure and subsequent publication of a preliminary draft of a committee report .
he says , in his letter to the RCMP :
" that denies the existence of the Qu 茅 b 茅 cois people and their culture , which once again reflects the government ' s centralizing vision by confirming and increasing its presence in areas of provincial jurisdiction such as social programs , health and especially education , and '' .
i was born and raised in Charlesbourg and I still live there .
however , future contributions will eventually reach some 9.9 % to be shared by those two groups .
speech FROM THE THRONE
it was a book filled with congratulations .
i have taken the time this summer to travel throughout the riding and sit in on the Grey County Federation of Agriculture and the Simcoe County Federation of Agriculture meetings .
while Reformers can argue that a super RRSP , according to their arithmetic , will be better for Canadians , when we get to fine details it is a much different story .
Mr. Ren 茅 Canuel ( Matap 茅 dia - Matane , BQ ) :
i would also extend to the Speaker my sincere congratulations on his election .
when they download on to the provinces they have to do one of two things , accept the download or download themselves on to the backs of the municipalities , again forgetting there is only one taxpayer .
we are honest folks .
i am proud of the initiatives brought forward by the government to assist in the continued development of the tourism industry .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
i will say more about that in a moment .
obviously we need to do that in an open and transparent fashion .
SchoolNet is an excellent example .
Mr. Speaker , maybe the member for Saint - Maurice can help us understand how it is that such an extraordinary grant was given to a hotel chain in his riding .
that is why above all when this government speaks of Canada ' s future , it will deliver its message with one united voice for all Canadians , that in the true spirit of Canadianism what we ensure for one we must be prepared to ensure for all .
these people are so cynical .
three weeks ago in Brazil , I became convinced more than ever before that plans for a trade agreement covering the entire hemisphere are about to materialize .
i agree with the NDP member , Mr. Speaker .
this is very interesting .
shortly afterward after having held the consultation in which I did not get a commitment from all parties represented pursuant to Standing Order 78 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , then on the floor of the House moments later , a further dilatory motion was produced within minutes of the end of our meeting , this time proposed by an NDP member , the purpose of which was again to further delay proceeding on the bill .
Mr. Speaker , I refer to a finance department report that says the very best Canadians can expect from the government until the end of the century is 7.8 % unemployment .
if any member whose name I have just read wishes to withdraw as a candidate for the third ballot , would he please rise in his place and do so ?
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Minister of Human Resources Development admitted that at least five funding proposals being processed by his department were the subject of blackmail and influence peddling to raise funds for the Liberal Party of Canada .
in February the government announced the youth employment strategy which consolidated over $ 2 billion in new and existing funding for programs and services that young people need to acquire the skills and work experience to find jobs and lasting careers .
the people of Vancouver East are waiting for a response with hope that the government will demonstrate that it is willing to act .
Mr. Jim Jones
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
that optimism is witnessed every day by Guelph - Wellington citizens like Luiz Danninger , president of Trodat Canada Inc. , producers of self - inking office stamps .
Mr. Stan Dromisky
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) :
accordingly , Mr. Speaker with the House went up to the Senate Chamber .
the comments of Mr. Spector are simply irresponsible and help create the problem not solve it .
we believe that this in turn will reduce intergenerational inequity by charging more to baby boomers , who , generally speaking , have another 20 years to put in on the labour market .
Mr. Bill Blaikie
and the count having been taken :
from the time of its first election in October 1993 , the Liberal government has made job creation its top priority .
by investing now in the well - being of today ' s children we are improving the long term social and economic health of our society .
Mr. Speaker , for 10 years Health Canada has been working to address this problem .
still , Quebecers are patient as they approach the new millennium .
it is just plain wrong .
even more than that , when it comes to such extremely important aspects as money laundering , who gains from it ?
let us remember that the money referred to by the government in its speeches has already been committed in the two previous years ' budgets .
on July 9 I notified the House that I wished to reintroduce two bills from the last Parliament with minor or no modifications .
the issue is why the Reform Party is trying to crush this debate .
second , the public sees an erosion of the RRSP system by recent changes in government tax policy that restrict rather than expand the RRSP system .
will the prime minister become proactive on the unity issue , starting with a firm commitment today to mail the Calgary declaration to every household in Quebec ?
if a you happen to be a widow , under the government ' s plan , after your husband has paid into the plan for 47 years at $ 3,300 a year , you can count on $ 460 a month .
seven thousand dollars .
in terms of human index development , Canada ranked out of 100 at about 95.1 , which is the best in the world .
team Canada trade missions have successfully generated new opportunities for Canadian businesses and have illustrated what we can accomplish when governments and the private sector collaborate .
it has not been confirmed exactly who the targets of the investigation might be .
i do not know why government members do not want to adopt something like that instead of paying a measly $ 436 a month to the surviving spouse .
however as Canada ' s closest land access departure point to Europe , our potential is sadly underutilized .
the Reform Party rhetoric is one thing and principled action is completely something else as far as Reformers are concerned .
i believe that is a balanced approach and something that Canadians support .
Mr. Gordon Earle
we also invested heavily in technology .
i would only respond that some people in Canada are doing much better than others .
hon. Christine Stewart
now reports of patronage ridden contracting , unethical fundraising and politically motivated grants keep piling up .
this same government is now talking about reinvestments and partnerships .
he suggested that maybe the committee does not need any instruction , although I would suggest that a committee with some senators on it might at least require instruction on the subject of democratic consent .
when we travel around the world we realize that we are the envy of the world .
Mr. Jason Kenney
what specific steps will he take to inform Quebeckers about the content of the Calgary declaration ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano
it wants to use it to serve its own interests and improve its visibility , not to ensure our development .
the Yukon weather centre operates with 12 highly qualified people and has been in the north since 1942 .
at least with that I say he is beginning to address the problem .
it is high time that each of us makes at least a minimum show of solidarity .
but if there were a $ 1 billion cutback in corporate taxes , there would only be 14,000 jobs created .
Mr. Speaker , first of all , I believe that , with all due respect for your decision , if you were to agree to consider the motion , you would find there was agreement .
the annual report will list the challenge and state how the challenge is being dealt with : again transparency and accountability .
there are four options available .
Mr. Peter Stoffer :
Mr. Speaker , I listened with interest to the discourse of the member for Durham and I was trying to think what it reminded me of .
there is a big hole in Bill C - 4 the way I see it as the transportation critic .
the hon. member for Laurier - Sainte - Marie .
what did Nova Scotians get from their oil and gas ?
i want to make that point by talking about some of the things that are in our document , Beyond a Balanced Budget .
this government recognizes the importance of dealing firmly with those offenders who threaten public safety .
is Reform afraid that we will see how much its plan will gouge the Canadian people ?
is that what we have come to ?
compare that with the administration burden of the Canada pension plan at 2 % .
these are the sorts of things that go on constantly with our taxpayers ' money .
Mr. Murray Calder :
people had all kinds of very interesting input .
as Joseph Maingot writes in his book Parliamentary Privilege in Canada at page 73 :
that is what is extremely important and the public should remember that , defined contribution plans .
we will ensure that our future economic opportunities are sound , our children well prepared , our lives healthy , and our communities strong .
the progressive strategy of combining youth , government and the private sector is working .
after the passports of the two persons making the attack had been reported as being Canadian , our consular officials in Jordan were allowed by the Jordanian authorities to see the passports and they then concluded they were forgeries .
Mr. Jay Hill
the budget surplus we are approaching has been achieved through sacrifices made by all Canadians and we believe Canadians deserve to have a little more in their pockets .
it is in all the newspapers .
agreed .
consumer spending is up and so is business investment .
some change has occurred but I think the results of the June election illustrate that Canadians are not yet quite satisfied .
a hungry child is much more likely to be a behavioural problem .
i want to make sure that research , science and innovation get their fair share of the budget .
hon. Jean J . Charest :
Mr. David Iftody
clearly that is not good enough for the opposition .
furthermore , when we look at other areas , such as research and development , technology , technological partnership , and so on , the Government of Canada is certainly prepared to give Quebec more than its fair share .
Mr. Speaker , given the fact that 70 percent of CIDA contractors were big Liberals and given the latest RCMP investigation into corrupt Liberal fundraising it is crucial that the government clear the air and clean up its act .
the Deputy Speaker :
privacy COMMISSIONER REPORT
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabasca , PC ) :
foreign AFFAIRS
i happen to live in one of Quebec ' s many beautiful regions , but this one is particularly attractive , in my opinion .
with limited financial resources we assisted the settlement of new Canadians , making sure they had a chance to acquire the language , the customs and gave assistance with job searches .
i have paid rates as high as 22 percent at a time when this same Liberal Party was running the country .
my success was shared with members on both sides of the House .
satellite DISHES
all this is good news for Canadians .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
it is estimated that each additional $ 1 billion in foreign direct investment helps to create 45,000 new jobs over five years .
admittedly there will always be work to be done and the best can always get better .
the federal government however chooses to view everything in terms of revenue and expenditures .
it is most important that we guarantee all our young people today , not just the ones who are sitting in the House , but those across the country that there will be a retirement plan , a Canada pension plan for them .
Mr. Pat Martin
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for his question .
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
they are not competent .
whatever their agenda , the bottom line is that these Liberals are refusing to allow enough informed and constructive debate to clearly show Canadians what this is all about .
i am very proud that the government is committed to helping children at risk .
free TRADE AGREEMENT
Mr. Speaker , anybody who follows the economy knows full well that the major problem of large industrial countries has been a perpetuation of the boom and the bust cycle .
Manicouagan is one of the loveliest ridings in Quebec .
therefore I am particularly interested in a couple of the comments he made pertaining to the position of the Bloc Quebecois .
he obviously did not seem aware of the fact .
in the global community of the next millennium discrimination will be a non - starter for those who will want to be equal partners in world affairs .
Mr. Hec Clouthier :
leader OF THE PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE PARTY
the first three year period would commence three years from the passage of the measure except for certain crises such as recession , severe flood , earthquake or war .
some hon. members :
Mr. Rahim Jaffer
first , we have read in the paper that knowledge of what was going on was given on March 6 and it took until after July 12 to surface .
the other half will be invested in important social and economic programs , including job creation initiatives .
some hon. members :
these changes are far too small .
such debates are nothing new ; it is not the first time Quebec society has felt the need to review its school system .
we are a trading nation , yet we have higher payroll taxes than our major trading partners .
when it concentrates in one pile you know exactly what it does '' .
is a directive from the Bloc Quebecois .
he spoke on the issue of the population explosion , of the need for peace in the world , on the equality of all races , and the matter dearest to his heart , the veterans of Canada and , indeed , the veterans of all countries .
what did we learn ?
i made a very strong point of saying that I find highly offensive this characterization of contributions to a pension plan as payroll taxes .
miss Deborah Grey
i decline to ever judge on the quality of either a question or an answer .
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to present to Parliament a petition signed by 54 people in my riding of Red Deer , Alberta .
the literature and the commentary of the government are already referring to regionally equitable investments .
we may not assimilate , we may not blend , but for all that we are still the component parts of the same country .
Mr. Bob Kilger
it has always seemed to me that until today there has been a more simplistic attachment to the result of referenda than we see today .
i would like to get his opinion on health care and what it should be into the third millennium .
he shows up about once every two years and yet he continues to collect his pay cheque of around $ 85,000 per year .
the reality is Canada ' s government has a commitment to its youth and the extent to which we take advantage of that , no matter what province they live in , is a positive thing .
Mr. Speaker , first of all , I would like to say that I will be splitting my time with my colleague , the member for Charlesbourg .
we think it is important that the public be invited to consult on these sorts of issues .
and he referred to Quebec as a very unique province .
if we had that money to apply to health care , we could run every single hospital in the country for two years on one year ' s interest payments on the Canadian debt .
Mr. Speaker , I intend to share my time with my colleague , the hon. member for Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac .
how can we explain the long delay between March 1997 , when the scandal was discovered , and the search in the premises of the Liberal Party of Canada on June 12 , 1997 , just a few days after the government was re - elected ?
vacancy
it is very clear that with what transpired this summer and the routine fleecing of consumers at the pumps there is need for protection , particularly for the independent suppliers of product who frequently face reductions in the margins at which they operate at the retail level .
all I can say again to the member is to please open his eyes and begin reflecting the will of the constituents because the writing is on the wall : the times they are a changing .
Mr. Speaker , I move , seconded by the Leader of the Opposition :
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
we know that the average income is somewhere around $ 8,800 and falling .
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Human Resources Development told us about the action he took to ensure that the allegations we have been discussing for several days regarding Liberal Party fundraising would not lead to the spread of fraudulent activities .
before starting question period I want to share with you some of the intentions developed with the House leaders in consultation with me .
in case he did not hear I will repeat for him that I was talking about aboriginal youth .
a good many of them .
that is the situation .
introduction and first reading
no doubt the primary reason for this tactic is to save money , but this is being achieved on the backs of the disabled .
the personality they settled on was Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the new group of MPs around him .
what I heard from NDP candidates during the election campaign was that their agenda was similar to the eastern European agenda .
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan ( Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
an hon. member :
Mr. Speaker , first , if we compare the salaries of the presidents of about 15 companies in Canada which do the same volume of business as Canada Post , Mr. Clermont ' s salary is the lowest .
i have never been in a Parliament that has not been lively .
every Quebec premier has always said that education is sacred , primarily because it has to do with one ' s identity , culture and training .
as I have said on many occasions , in my riding I am the servant of the people .
indeed , I cannot help but mention that , on March 9 , 1994 , I asked a question to the then Minister of Human Resources Development concerning the reform of social programs .
Mr. Peter MacKay :
RCMP INVESTIGATION
CPP contributions represent an interested investment by Canadians in their own future .
speech FROM THE THRONE
i congratulate the minister responsible for the wheat board for what has been a truly Herculean task .
i certainly welcome any support he could provide in that instance .
at the sentencing hearing the judge said that it was such an awful crime there was no way the killer should be paroled for 25 years .
is the President of the Treasury Board telling us that , after the revelations made yesterday on CBC radio , he did not bother to check with his employee , a member of his political staff , if indeed he was implicated in this matter ?
things have changed .
i had some nice things to say , but out of respect for the Chair , and for this democratic institution , the Parliament of Canada , I will move on to my comments on Bill C - 4 .
Mr. Speaker , the party opposite has a clear - cut goal .
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour and pleasure to inform you that the Federation of Canadian Municipalities has been selected from over 60 entries to receive the scroll of honour award from the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements , Habitat .
i do not think tax cuts have any relevance .
small business needs access to capital , trade and technology .
reform has not indicated a clear plan of how it would implement the system .
Mr. Pierre Brien
Mr. Charlie Penson :
i think all candidates ran a respectful campaign .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Labour .
that might not greatly affect provinces like British Columbia , Alberta or Ontario that have borrowing rates that are lower because their bond ratings are higher than the average .
in the last House the government used closure 29 times , the most in the whole history of Parliament .
i guarantee that their experience will be unforgettable .
this strategy was put forward in a situation of crisis and urgency , and out of the 40,000 there are 15,000 who have been able to adjust outside of the industry .
so too is the recent announcement in our government ' s throne speech to establish a Canada millennium scholarship endowment fund .
despite the fact that there are differences in Canada - I mentioned that - we are all equal .
there is no one simple answer to this issue .
we were elected by the people of this country to come to the floor of the House of Commons and debate the issues of the day .
at different points in this country ' s history some provinces have always prospered more than others .
in closing I quote a statesman from another parliament in another time but whose words are very appropriate today .
there is much to be done in this regard , and perhaps an interesting model could be developed .
Jim has given up some of his retirement time to raise funds for the new River Run Centre , an arts and entertainment complex which will officially open this week .
you know , we should not be surprised , this is the Liberal style .
we must be prepared to move forward and meet the challenges we face as a nation .
that is utter rubbish and nonsense .
i also want to take this time to thank the Prime Minister and his previous government for having the fortitude to take us from what was near certain economic ruin to a healthy deficit free economy in four short years .
in its Speech from the Throne , the government is predicting a brilliant future for Canada during the third millennium .
Mr. Speaker , the United Nations has designated today as world habitat day , a day to reflect on our communities , their importance in our lives .
Canadians would once again be in the debt hole and the Liberals would once again come back to them and say " Trust us .
we have the basic social benefit , the Canada pension plan system and the tax assisted RRSP system .
in the very near future the government of Canada will not have to deal with a crushing deficit .
in Plessiville the Employment Canada office was closed , over local protests .
they pay twice to two institutions , and end up exploited and with fewer services than they ought to have .
i do not know how we can get them to smarten up and tell the truth to Canadians .
Mr. Chuck Strahl
i come from Atlantic Canada .
the hon. member for Cambridge , a brief response , please .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
he said that his party , were it in power , would have passed a bill and made these changes statutory .
the concept of social justice is what gives Canada its reputation for compassion and tolerance .
that is exactly what we are doing here today .
Ms. Trickey ' s act of courage opened the doors to many African American children to be admitted to the Little Rock High School and brought the issue of segregated schools to the forefront of American politics .
the statement goes on " A statesman plans for the next generation '' .
the throne speech was clear in stating that in order to secure a strong Canada for the 21 st century , governments will need to work more closely with others in partnership .
he was a vigorous spokesman for the elderly , for the poor , for the less favoured people in our society .
petitions
Mr. Speaker , yesterday in question period the minister of Indian affairs bragged about the level of accountability to aboriginal people .
companies which are part of the Ottawa - Carleton region ' s thriving high technology industry can be found in the northern part of my riding which is part of the city of Nepean .
the question remains unanswered .
edited HANSARD * NUMBER 3
Mr. Speaker , I am from the proud island of Cape Breton .
what criteria are taken into account in the appointment of its directors ?
i thank them for placing their confidence in me once again .
it is extremely naive for the member to suggest that the reason that Canadians voted the Liberals in with a diminished mandate was because of their promise to spend 50 percent of any surpluses on new spending .
Mr. Jack Ramsay
Clair have only local concerns .
any time that two parties can negotiate and settle their differences without any interference from outside is the best way to go .
in fact the evidence seems to point to the fact that companies that are focused more on growing their business and not so much on cost cutting have experienced better profitability performance over the last few years .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
transportation
my question is for the President of the Treasury Board .
let us be very clear .
recently in an interview she talked about the drug Imitrex which is used to combat the debilitating effects of migraine headaches .
does the health minister condone these attempts to smear her reputation ?
perhaps we should invite him over to sit with us .
we listened to Canadians , we ensured fairness and balance in the review of the Canada pension plan and the legislation that is being put forward .
speech FROM THE THRONE
the plan protects those who are already in the current system .
we went to the people and we asked them how to do it .
this is a reference of a report to a committee .
in addition we have refocused and broadened the mandate of the Business Development Bank of Canada .
Mr. Speaker , I am referring to the Canadian Constitution .
that is the situation in Ontario .
i trust the government will have the humility to acknowledge the work of so many Canadians whose pressure on our own government and others laid the foundation for this important success .
last week I had the opportunity to speak to the Canadian Publishers Association which was entertaining a delegation of 20 Japanese publishers .
what the government proposes with respect to the seniors benefit is not a strengthening of that pillar .
second , we are doing our best .
sadly these communities are often overlooked for their leadership and commitment but not , however , by the Liberal government .
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
in this vein , I think I can say , without any chance of being mistaken , that it was a good thing Quebec ' s National Assembly passed the legislation creating the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t in 1965 , because otherwise this powerful instrument , which was necessary for all the others in an unfavourable Canadian context , would never have seen the light of day .
the task ahead does have some bright spots .
he was talking about how literate Canadian youth are .
then there was the Pearson airport contract .
we will not , as some opposition members have charged , abandon the attitude of fiscal responsibility that got this nation ' s finances back on track .
Tom Edwards has served his community well over the years and Whitby is a better place for it .
it now states that the federal government cannot act alone .
Ms. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) :
what a time ; no worries , no cares , just them and those Labrador sport fish .
as the week progresses I will be in communication with members opposite in regard to adding additional business .
i want to tell you one thing : the people of Abitibi are proud of the fact that I am here and I have nothing to hide .
the $ 6.25 an hour jobs are for a maximum of 26 weeks so they can go back on EI .
i can assure the prime minister and the finance minister they will have my support and my constituents ' support to stay the course of fiscal prudence and to find opportunities for young people .
we can ' t understand the operation because our selling agency is not even responsible to us '' .
they do not understand a thing about integrity in government .
without hesitation the prime minister and the government took the initiative to restore the funding and accepted the recommendation of the committee .
as everyone in this House knows , you are one of the brightest minds in parliamentary procedure this House has ever seen .
when people ask me what it means to be Canadian , I can tell them to look to our very beginning , to look to the early days when the British and the French landed on the shores of our country and met the First Nations , the indigenous people .
we are asking for answers about what they did subsequent to the reporting and what other assurances the House has that the practice will not continue .
Cozier and Mang wrote that payroll tax increases would therefore have lowered cumulative employment growth over the recovery by just under one percentage point .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate the member for Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke on his maiden speech .
Mr. Speaker , in light of the fact that the private member ' s bill introduced earlier today by the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest had previously passed all stages in this House and had been referred to the Senate where it passed all stages , I would like to ask the unanimous consent of the House to deem it to have passed all stages again .
Mr. Nelson Riis :
No.
it means making these offenders responsible and accountable for their crimes through other means .
we will go from five to four to three in a short period of 40 years .
i have given notice to the minister of my intention to ask such a question .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to take this opportunity to comment on the 40 th anniversary of an important event in black American history and to congratulate a Canadian citizen who is part of that history .
it did not take very long to realize that our system of justice is seriously out of kilter .
reformers do not tell us about that when they tout the effectiveness of their RRSP plan .
the important thing is Canadians want to know their funds are being invested .
however , I disagree profoundly with the emphasis it places on where we should go .
at that time , the prospects of rapid growth and real wages and labour force participation promised that the CPP could be sustained and remain affordable .
in fulfilling this role over the last four years , I have had the opportunity to meet with business people across Canada in all sectors of industry .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅
it certainly will give a better return to the investment .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
i have just described the legacy of 30 years of chronic overspending by successive Liberal and Tory governments .
reform got over 15 % of the votes without a party to back it up , just behind the Liberals .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
i would like to ask the member for Algoma - Manitoulin what he considers to be accountability and what he considers being left behind .
the hon. member will be aware that we have recalled our ambassador to Israel for consultations .
i am convinced that it is possible to find a basis for agreement .
other political parties such as the Reform Party have also tried to cobble together some sort of a plan , but it is important to note from the perspective of Canadians that the Reform Party has not put any numbers forth .
the tainted grant went ahead anyway and the Liberal bagman was still working for the Liberal Party .
in the face of this spurious choice of a renewed federalism provided everyone fits the same mold , we say that our aspirations are legitimate , that they are imbued with the spirit of democracy and that we are marching down that road to freedom and to our future .
hon. Don Boudria
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
if it was not for the Reform Party , the Liberal government , no doubt , never would have focused on the deficit .

international TRADE
i believe that one who says that there has been a breach of this Parliament for an act that occurred in a previous Parliament is not a question of privilege .
some reference was made earlier to the Raglan Mining Company and we will clarify that , because this is one of the companies that is involved because of the Liberal Party and that has unfortunately been dragged into a messy situation .
- Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Votes 1 , 5 , 10 , 15 , L 20 , L 25 , L 30 , 35 , 40 , 45 and 50
with all the trade agreements , the linking of the markets in the financial sense , it has caused power to shift .
we know that the Canada student loans program has helped young Canadians to get an education .
we heard from a government that wants to repent , a government that tells us it will reinvest money in certain programs .
with the fiscal crisis at an end , our government has more ability to act .
i do not remember it because it is not worthwhile remembering what that acronym stood for .
yes , there are issues of alienation that must and will be addressed by people who are unified in the belief that this country is worth preserving .
Mr. Jim Gouk
Mr. Speaker , first let me offer my congratulations to you on your new office .
to all those affected by this ultimate act of despair , my thoughts are with you .
i would also point out that the plan itself seems to be having trouble changing over to more efficient computer systems : $ 350 billion has already been spent on this and there is still a problem .
Mr. Speaker , after 10 years and many successes this particular program has ended as planned .
Mr. Speaker , first and foremost , like others I want to congratulate you and welcome you to the Chair .
that having been said , I will proceed directly to the motion by the Leader of the Bloc Quebecois .
the Canada pension plan is part of our public pension plan system along with old age security and guaranteed income supplement .
his belief has proven to be well founded .
Mr. Speaker , the Government of Alberta consulted the people , got their message and then went to the people in an election and got a bigger mandate .
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) :
John recently travelled , as a Canadian volunteer adviser , to Russia to assist a private company that publishes a newspaper and produces stencilled colour printing .
it has been suggested under their proposal that a retiree might collect $ 117,000 more over the course of 30 or 40 years , or about $ 25 a week .
hon. Don Boudria
let us hope that opening it up to the producers is something real , and not just caving in to community pressures .
the problem is that somebody has to pay the bill , and that falls on us here today .
i would like to thank the people of Rosemont and Petite - Patrie , as well as all of my riding volunteers , for the trust they have given me in the last federal election .
i would think jobs would be number one and we cannot just do that with tax cuts .
to quote the President of Treasury Board in the March 8 , 1996 edition of Le Soleil , " When Bouchard - he does not even have the decency to show a little respect for the Premier of Quebec - will have to make cuts , those of us in Ottawa will be able to demonstrate that we have the means to preserve the future of social programs '' .
in an attempt to protect his close friend from embarrassment , Ted Thompson telephoned Chief Justice Isaac to warn him of the proposed supreme court reference .
we have endured endless years of cutbacks that have severely affected the lives of the many poor and unemployed Canadians who live in the inner city of Winnipeg .
now we have another man in on this .
the Speaker :
precautionary measures like voluntary programs are much more economically viable and are in fact making progress .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member started by talking about the Pacific salmon treaty , as she did last week with the same preface to the question .
the government claims to recognize the primary role of science and technology in preserving the public ' s health and well - being .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
that is what the House leader said in 1991 .
i do not know of any other governments that have been involved .
the current foreign content limit of 20 percent reduces Canadian pension earnings by about $ 700 million per year .
in other words , producers will not be allowed to join the commission when prices are down and then to opt out when prices go up .
i was asked to help them differentiate between Canadians and Americans .
being new to this place I do not really know whether to be optimistic or cynical .
it is very difficult to be more ridiculous than that because they moved a motion that says " This House declines to give second reading to Bill C - 2 '' .
i am proud to say that Leeds - Grenville is now one of the most populated ridings of CAP sites in the country .
at that time , if it is necessary , I will make a decision .
can the Secretary of State for Children and Youth tell us what the federal government is doing to combat child poverty ?
what has been done ?
if the Liberal government resurrects Bill C - 65 in its flawed and accusatory form , it will be a slap in the face to all of those farmers , ranchers and resource industry workers who are already participating in programs and initiatives designed to protect endangered species and who have already set aside sections of their land as wildlife habitat .
the system should be working to improve the lives of the disabled , not to penalize them for trying to seek a more active and productive life .
the Speaker :
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) :
now we can move forward .
* * *
these issues were debated fiercely on this side of the House in this caucus .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
this matter could be resolved through a supreme court reference by either the Government of Canada or the Government of Quebec .
i hope the government will adopt it as a votable motion and will pass it forthwith .
i believe this government is certainly doing that with some of the programs that I outlined .
Mr. Philip Mayfield ( Cariboo - Chilcotin , Ref. ) :
Mr. David Pratt
Mr. Joe Comuzzi
Mr. Speaker , I have a petition from hundreds of citizens of the Peterborough region who are concerned about the impact of the Food and Drug Act and its use in a range of products , including vitamins , herbs and various minerals .
we identified 33 key areas of growth in our economy .
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
the Deputy Speaker :
he did not have much substance but he tried to get a vision of the north .
members will agree that this is where the problem lies .
seventy per cent of the people in B.C. who responded to a survey said that secession should be on the table .
this is what leads me to think that the debate will be calm .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
the SENATE
speech FROM THE THRONE
now it seems that the CRTC culture police want to treat them as criminals even before the courts have made a final ruling .
the fact remains that the growing concern among Canadians about the future of health care and about medicare must be addressed because we cannot take the overwhelming support for the public health care system for granted .
the first step is equipping them with these basic skills .
Mr. Jason Kenney
let us talk about his visits to his riding .
each day across this country new libraries are being connected to this excellent program .
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) :
i refer to the comment in the throne speech on the child tax benefit increase that the government is proposing to bring into effect on July 1 , 1998 . It is good to see that there will be an increase in the child tax benefit allowance .
there were some measures in the finance minister ' s budget last year which provided for improvement to RRSPs and savings that parents could do for their children .
the Minister of Human Resources Development was in fact made aware of this in a letter from Gaston Laviolette , the mayor of the municipality of Bellefeuille and the reeve of the Rivi 猫 re - du - Nord RCM and Marc Gascon , the mayor of the city of Saint - J 茅 r 么 me .
hon. Jane Stewart :
since 1993 this government has increased taxes no less than 40 times : 12 hikes in the 1994 budget , 11 hikes in the 1995 budget , 10 in the 1996 budget and more in the budget of this year .
that is the principle that the rights of minorities in this country if they are entrenched in the Constitution ought not to be taken away without the specific consent of that minority group that is involved in that decision .
some hon. members :
could he let us know what he intends to do about component three of the strategy , considering that his department is proceeding with an evaluation ?
( motion agreed to )
i take a great deal of satisfaction from knowing I voted in a way I felt was right for my province and for the nation .
can the solicitor general please explain to my constituents , indeed to all Canadians , why the government insists on giving this open door policy to first degree murderers at the expense of the people who are the victims in these cases ?
that medal would be set out so that individuals in our country who have contributed to our nationhood would be recognized by the government and by Parliament .
members will hear me speak in Parliament about the arts industry because I believe it is just that , an industry .
furthermore , the government House leader indicated today that adequate and reasonable notice was given to me in the House .
we have had in the past few years some very strong confidence shaking concerns in matters of health in this country .
the answer is no .
division No. 5
the tax hikers increased employment , percentage wise , zero .
we Have Already Built a Foundation for Our Success
youth unemployment is simply too high .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question .
the hon. member for Halifax .
house OF COMMONS
is that agreed ?
while I congratulate Stratford , I would like to point out that three of the four finalists were Canadian towns .
pay EQUITY
the Government of Canada ' s endowment of the Canada Foundation for Innovation in partnership with the private sector , the provinces and universities , is helping to build a leading - edge national system of innovation .
for example the time that parents spend out of the labour force to care for their children does not diminish their CPP pension , but it certainly does diminish their contributions to an RRSP .
instead the minister turned the matter over to the former chief justice of Ontario , Charles Dubin , a person , and I quote the minister , " whose experience and integrity in such matters is beyond question '' .
i would like an answer from the prime minister - in - waiting , please .
i ask you to ask him to bring his remarks to a close .
canada PENSION PLAN
regardless , Canadians are still waiting .
Mr. Gerald Keddy
Mr. Speaker , I am sharing my time this afternoon with my colleague , the hon. member for Perth - Middlesex .
in my opinion we should take some lessons from our neighbours to the south .
let me turn to another aspect of the bill , one of the most important ones and one of the ones completely neglected by the parliamentary secretary in his presentation .
hon. Don Boudria
i would like to say that we want to reduce unemployment and we are working very hard on it .
at that time , the Liberals strongly condemned that practice .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
we lead the way in providing alternative solutions .
third , would fellow Canadians vote for the program if the question was put to them ?
in one way or another more than 12,000 individuals and organizations responded to the panel ' s recommendations .
we see a real demand by producers for freedom to choose .
no prime minister in the last 30 years has had to deal with the problem of a surplus .
he stated that he had a conversation with an official in the office of the access to information commissioner and claimed he was advised that the member was entitled to the information he had sought as a representative of the individual band members present .
we want to know whether or not he checked with his executive assistant -
there are , of course , certain interesting adjustments , but for seasonal workers or young people graduating from university , this reform is completely inaccessible .
how about at least lowering the payroll tax that kills jobs ?
after all , I was given 10 minutes as everyone else was .
i am very proud to say that in the last Parliament our small caucus was able to persuade the government to come forth with a stronger bill which is why we can support this bill in principle today .
keep that in mind when telling the story because the story ought to be told in full and not just selectively .
let me just quote some figures .
the fact is this is a good general plan .
at present the future of the mining sector is in some doubt because mineral reserves are being depleted at a faster pace than they are being replenished .
i am sounding an alarm , and I believe that considerable thought must be given to this .
user FEE ACT
throughout the election campaign , it was clear to me that the people of St. Paul ' s respected the Liberal record of fiscal responsibility .
the Canadian passport like the maple leaf is a trusted symbol of our country .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
in its throne speech , the government said that compassion and generosity were the hallmarks of this country .
at the same time , this government is compassionate and recognizes that there are social and economic priorities far beyond tax reductions .
in Canada , we do not believe a choice must be made between independence and responsibility to one another .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
he must realize however that my reply was directed to the Leader of the Opposition .
the problem is not a new one .
that is very much the route we should take .
it was a dream I had .
it will consult people about what to put on the $ 2 coin but not on how to spend the 75 billion $ 2 coins that taxpayers have to send in every year .
again with respect to seniors , the changes proposed by this bill regarding OAS and GIS have profound implications for seniors and the income they can look forward to under the new seniors benefit proposal .
mostly I leave it up to the people of Canada to be the judge .
the leader of the Conservative Party is very badly placed to comment on unemployment insurance premiums .
in a similar way , hundreds of young people are getting experience in working with the new technologies through employment with community access programs and SchoolNet .
we have been very well served by the leadership in this Chamber .
the hon. member for Calgary Southwest said the government is not being genuine because it is really a tax .
we are going to examine this and I hope we can make great progress .
under what pretext is the Minister of Human Resources Development providing confidential lists of people waiting for grants to the political ministers responsible for the regions , and who instructed him to do so ?
Mr. Speaker , I took great pleasure in listening to the hon. government member talk about the beauty and the uniqueness of the part of the country she is from .
these are confidential lists .
Mr. Jason Kenney
the hon. member for Charlotte can believe or not that the minister is well prepared .
the money is still out in the system and will come back not only in its original form but also added to it will be some of the benefits of the growth that has actually occurred in the economy .
Mr. Speaker , congratulations on your appointment to your position as Deputy Speaker , an exciting , stimulating position during these speeches .
Mr. Preston Manning
is the hon. member saying that he is against the Canada pension plan achieving a higher rate of return than has been -
the majority of the 200 people killed in this massacre were women and children .
that is what this bill is about -
perhaps by talking about it tonight people will realize who he is and he will be arrested and will be off the streets and back in jail where he belongs .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay
i visited that mine in August .
yet we have the Reform Party saying that the government has spent too much , there are too many social programs , we need to be cut back and that is the cause of high taxes and high unemployment .
can it do both ?
according to the director , the visibility and pre - eminent location of the employment centre are essential to serve Saint - J 茅 r 么 me and the surrounding area and especially the other cities served by Saint - J 茅 r 么 me following the streamlining of the employment centres by the minister .
there are a couple of points we should not forget .
i want to defend members of Parliament who may be affronted by the member ' s comment about voting the way that somebody tells them .
some hon. members :
the plan first paid out in 1967 to those who were 68 years old , and the first pension paid to a 65 year old occurred in 1970 .
all parties in the House set down the regulations .
at the operational level those words have been replaced by words like influence peddling , string pulling and shakedown .
Mr. Greg Thompson :
* * *
in his remarks this week , His Excellency the Governor General drew attention to the fact that we are the last Parliament of the 20 th century and the first of the 21 st century .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I appreciate the opportunity to rise for the first time officially in this House .
i wish them and the company continued success .
if the provincial government is confident as it says it is that there is a broad province wide consensus in favour of the amendment , it should conduct a referendum in order to demonstrate that fact beyond a reasonable doubt to this House and to other Canadians .
it is tired of having to play the heavy , the one to make the cuts to the taxpayer , while the federal government , because of the taxation power the provinces have given it to collect taxes in its stead , has equipped itself with a tool for making the provinces subservient .
such hardening is being promoted in an irresponsible fashion by the comments of the Reform Party , by the actions of the Liberal Party of Canada , and by the collusive silence of the leader of the Conservative Party .
first , Canadians are living longer than they did in the past .
there is also the Quebec pension plan .
while people are getting poorer and poorer and while the government refuses to recognize Quebec ' s identity , it will create the illusion of wealth and the illusion of the acceptation of Quebec by the outstretched hand that actually just wants to crush us and bring us down to our knees .
who was under investigation at that time ?
government services will be available to Canadians wherever they are 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
yesterday I rose on a point of order during Routine Proceedings after the member for Scarborough Southwest had introduced a private member ' s bill which in the previous Parliament passed all stages in both the House and the Senate .
the arguments of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs are once again refuted by common sense .
the June 2 general election marked the first back to back victories for a Liberal Party candidate in 45 years in my riding .
what a title and what a problem the government is creating with this bill .
we have two children .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
why not continue with the existing policy ?
however , I say that we can launch out , guided by love for our country , our community and a sincere concern for our neighbour .
however , in the next few years the plan will need more money to support future Canadians as they require the benefits from it .
yet , this is more than words since the French firm GEM PLUS announced a $ 20 million investment in a research center in Montreal .
Mr. Speaker , I would ask the justice minister if she would be prepared to share with the House her plans for when she is going to do this , who is going to be involved and the form it is going to take ?
what are the needs ?
the Speaker :
on the other hand , we will not neglect to make the necessary social investments such as the ones outlined in the speech .
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅
people can change .
if the Solicitor General is not in control , democracy is in jeopardy .
he therefore owes the people of Quebec some $ 2 billion .
the amendment moved by the hon. member for Palliser is in order .
by putting government services on - line , we can facilitate communications between government and the people like never before .
had we asked for a bill to be drafted for a month or two , or some such , and we could not take political action before next January or February , then I would consider my parliamentary privileges were being breached .
the leader of the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister are , until proven otherwise , one and the same person .
Mr. Bernard Bigras :
our riding is home to Churchill , the polar bear capital and a community of citizens such as Penny Rawlings and Robert Penwarden who believed in their town and the viability of the port of Churchill .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
but there are serious problems in this country that need to be addressed , that cannot be addressed by saying we can solve them just by reducing taxes .
i encourage all of my colleagues to work toward achieving these goals , not just on October 1 , but each and every day of the year .
Mr. Speaker , when a senator from British Columbia commented on renegotiating British Columbia ' s role in Confederation the intergovernmental affairs minister responded with comments that cannot even be repeated in this House .
i am encouraged that at least there is a reference in the throne speech to the issue of home care .
the government had an opportunity .
Mr. Jean Dub 茅 ( Madawaska - Restigouche , PC ) :
when the government abolishes that it will instead introduce a seniors benefit .
i would ask all hon. members not to use any props during question period .
the Speaker :
while dealing more appropriately with high and low risk offenders will remain a priority , it is imperative that we also work to prevent crime in the first instance .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien
he is preparing another team Canada trip for January .
like all members of this House , I think this is most unfortunate .
it is about having a vision .
because social issues are extremely important to Canadians , we have a very important job as official opposition in this House to hold the government accountable for what it is doing on behalf of Canadians and for the administration of their security and their futures .
that is the first question .
my constituents would like to hear that current benefits such as CPP retirement pensions , disability benefits , survivor benefits or combined benefits are not affected by the amendments in Bill C - 2 .
canada is also championing the free trade area of the Americas and is seeking a closer relationship with the countries of Mercosur .
they will drop by another $ 2.4 billion this year .
that group would be the loser by definition .
Mr. Peter MacKay
* * *
Mr. Lynn Myers :
not only would we have a repeat of the constitutional discussions of the early 1980 s but in another ill - advised piece of legislation passed by the government in the last Parliament , the separatist government in Quebec now has a veto over any constitutional amendment .
petitions
the effects of Henderson ' s goal are as profound today as they were when the puck first slammed against the meshing of the Soviet net .
however , I believe she is missing the point .
Mr. Gordon Earle
after hardly a word was said , the minister , who was already on the defensive , made it clear he did not want to hear anything about partisan politics in the matter .
the Chair thanks the hon. Leader of the Opposition for his remarks .
the second point is that he made reference to the last parliament and instances in which members of the current opposition received and supported bills that had originated in the Senate .
i therefore ask , Mr. Speaker , whether there are two sets of rules in the House .
with that said , this point of order is over unless the member has another point of order .
unfortunately , because of the larger than expected number of participants , TAGS will end in May 1998 .
reform speakers will raise many other considerations that must be debated before we vote on this bill .
how about an insurance program that is actuarially sound and free from political interference ?
comments during Oral Question Period
unlike the CPP contributions that are a savings toward pensions , EI premiums are an additional payroll tax that finance current expenditures .
in June 1995 , she went to Haiti as an election observer at taxpayers ' expense .
by remembering history , government must learn the importance of equality and fair treatment of all people .
i ask for all members to observe a time of silence in their own thoughts and pay tribute to the remarkable legacy of caring and giving that was Mother Teresa .
building on the team Canada success , we will consult with our industrial partners to further broaden our trading base outward in the world .
fisheries
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner :
anyone currently receiving Canada pension plan benefits , be it retirement pensions , disability benefits or survivor benefits , can rest assured that they will not see these benefits affected in any way .
the government ' s commitment to develop relationships with aboriginal people based on principles of partnership , transparency , predictability and accountability is very important and very significant .
my question to the other parties is :
canada PENSION PLAN
( 14 ) to the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs
similar to the theory of continuous learning for workers , Canadian firms must continually strive to improve and update their processes .
the biggest killer of jobs in terms of taxation are higher payroll taxes .
transitional job creation fund
let me look first at the economy .
Mr. Speaker , my suggestion to you , respectfully , would be as follows .
we do not intervene in investigations by the RCMP .
that the debate be now adjourned .
consequently , the government will select a minority of the CWB ' s directors , five in total , including the president .
they are expressing that discontent and a degree of frustration that indicates they have lost their sense of justice .
she always represented the most disadvantaged members of society with dignity and in her speech today she is once again standing up for those who do not have a voice in this Parliament .
he spoke with a great deal of eloquence about how well the government has done in his view .
it continues to cause our economy to lurch from boom to bust and by this every move turning the stock markets and serves only to make increased profits for financial -
we owe our greatest obligation to our young , the future of Canada .
in the final section of our paper we talk about the need for government to be accountable .
it is a novel approach in this place to recognize that the money belongs to Canadians .
honourable Members of the Senate , Members of the House of Commons :
i would also like at the beginning of my maiden speech in the House of Commons to thank my constituents for this great privilege .
government can be evaluated on many things including on how well it looks after the interests of all our citizens and how well it designs and manages programs , especially social programs .
parliamentarians of Canada , for the next few years because of circumstance , because of history and yes , because of destiny , the fate of our nation will rest in our hands .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources Development .
it is the province that decides on the alignment , design , construction standards , tendering process and how to finance the construction costs of the provincial highway system .
criminal CODE
Mr. Roy is still working for the minister .
today there was a call for an alleged emergency debate on the same issue and now an alleged question of privilege .
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay
with respect to the privileges of the House , divulging an in camera draft report is a breach since it runs against the tradition that members of the House have the right to first view reports of committees .
under the Reform plan every household is completely on its own .
bureaucratic inefficiency has cost farmers between $ 65 million and $ 115 million .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano
the youths explored emerging markets and designed a database of identified opportunities .
many people have had to cut costs .
Mr. Speaker , I am not the type of person who engages in semantics .
Mr. Brent St. Denis ( Algoma - Manitoulin , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , last night the 18 th annual Dora Awards ceremony was held at the Winter Garden Theatre in Toronto .
it would amend the Criminal Code so that an accused can no longer personally cross - examine a witness in such proceedings , unless the trial judge is of the opinion that it is necessary for the proper administration of justice .
it requires some ingenuity on the part of the government to recognize that there are problems out there which must be dealt with .
you are going to hold strong opinions , and as well you should .
i want to ask the Minister for International Trade , will he commit now to public hearings on the multilateral agreement on investment so that the many Canadians who are concerned about this can have input as to what the government should and should not be doing at those negotiations ?
we need to assure that people have the right to basic health care and make sure that we can sustain that into the next millennium .
we do not have our fiscal house in order .
we believe this is a priority .
what about tax fairness for families ?
just because an idea comes from the opposition does not automatically mean it is wrong .
madam Speaker , if the member would be courteous and respectful of the House -
the Speech from the Throne speaks to the issue of alternatives .
there also have to be personal tax reductions so that the decision or move to make CPP self - financing will not damage our economy the way the Liberals are ready to tolerate in the plan they are presenting .
to conclude , we support this legislation because it is designed to help future generations plan ahead so they are not faced with an empty fund at some point in time .
at the committee stage of course we will be moving amendments to improve the bill further .
pay EQUITY
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
one of the reasons we invite members of the Bloc and other Quebeckers to do that is that the minute we begin to give up on this notion and entertain notions of separation , we come up against the hard political and philosophical reality that it is not just the Quebecois and the Quebecoises who consider themselves a people but , for instance , the aboriginal people of Quebec are also a people .
the Chair would gently remind hon. members to address other hon. members through the Chair .
i am interested to see the return of the Conservative Party .
introduction and first reading
some people may remember when the government quickly passed a motion to live up to the prime minister ' s promise to recognize Quebec as a distinct society .
if he is referring to the Privacy Act , section 8.1 ( g ) does allow that personal information can be released to a member of Parliament " for the purpose of assisting the individual to whom the information relates in resolving a problem '' .
they cannot have it both ways .
what section ?
so , of course , one of the two parents comes out looking good , but he or she has done this with the other ' s money , because only one of them has had to make any sacrifices .
we do not understand it nor do we understand the purpose of it .
their programs are good examples of what we need to do and more voices speaking for the businesses in my riding would ensure that we address some of those concerns .
that the Main Estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 1998 , laid upon the Table on October 1 , 1997 , be referred to the several Standing Committees of the House , as follows :
do we have a quorum ?
hon. John Manley
i draw the attention of hon. members to the presence in the gallery of Dr. Zoltan Gal , my brother Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary .
some say they are our future , and I agree .
we were not very sure where that money was going .
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , in anticipation of the upcoming farce in the Supreme Court about Quebec ' s right to decide its future , the Prime Minister has appointed an amicus curiae to speak on behalf of Quebec without any mandate from Quebec to do so .
they want accountability .
as a premier , he was always interested in the status of minorities .
so , is this the type of programs the hon. member feels we should eliminate to further reduce the deficit and the debt ?
i am glad that the member agrees that there is a need for reform .
government ORDERS
it was a privilege and an honour for me to have represented them during the 35 th Parliament .
this is going to cost a phenomenal amount of money .
as regards democracy , yes there were indeed two referendums : one in 1980 and the other in 1995 .
when some of them spoke I had to reach for my Oxford dictionary because they referred to the CPP as a tax .
we are an open and democratic society .
why should we believe in today ' s court judgments when the judges and the juries clearly say this is the penalty that must be applied because of the severity of the crime ?
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner ( Portage - Lisgar , Ref. ) :
this surprises me .
in the past they were based on a three - year average .
something smells funny in all this !
( p ) Public Accounts ( seventeen Members ) ; and
on division .
the initial weeks of the new Parliament have revealed the true face of this patronage government with its taste for light ethics .
there is unfortunately a history in the House of parties of all political stripes being tainted by allegations .
a third of our caucus are fresh recruits eager to join the veterans in the verbal battle in this place .
that is not the case .
* * *
that would not be a cost because it would pay for itself in a short time .
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
they made a big show about appointing an ethics commissioner and they promised that the days of Mulroney style political corruption were over .
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris - Moose Mountain , Ref. ) :
under this proposed legislation a board of 15 directors of whom 10 would be directly elected by producers would govern the operation of the wheat board .
in 20 years , there will be one person of retirement age for every four persons of working age .
the evidence is before the House today in the form of Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have another question on accountability .
Mr. Odina Desrochers :
Mr. Speaker , I have a question for the hon. member for Burin - St.
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member mentioned a point that I would like to clarify .
persons WITH DISABILITIES
many business people to whom I have talked , and the hon. member is a business man , know only too well how many people have not expanded their businesses because of the proposed increase in the CPP and employment insurance premiums .
* * *
it is written nicely .
let us start with the issue of the economy .
they are a very consistent bunch , the people of Ottawa West - Nepean .
it is an independent fund that will be managed separately .
Waterloo - Wellington is a rich and diverse riding of urban , rural and suburban people .
who could forget the hyena from Hamilton who shrieked and shrilled her way under the public ' s skin and who is now eligible for her $ 2.8 million gold plated MP pension plan ?
we pay our interest payments as the year goes by .
telecommunications
it is a simple proposition .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
second I would like to offer the government an idea .
but a fairer tax system to tax some of those who are not paying taxes in the country would contribute to the national good .
a nation ' s aspiration to sovereignty is not based on any misunderstanding .
is there some rule in the Liberal code of ethics providing that , in the case of this government , " if nobody can see you , nobody can catch you '' ?
these children are poor because their parents are poor .
i congratulate the member for York West on becoming the Minister of International Trade .
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am going to put it in the form of a question more than anything else .
Mr. Ken Epp
in one of his final speeches in the House 31 years ago , he reflected on a wide range of matters , some of which are very relevant today .
that the Committee have the power to retain the services of expert , professional technical and clerical staff ;
Quebec will make the same change to ensure the sustainability of its plan .
the House met at 2.30 p.m.
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
she has a unique culture and she understands , like we understand over here , that there are regions of Canada with different needs .
my predecessor , the member for Yukon , served in the House with dignity and devotion under much more difficult circumstances , outnumbered by her caucus colleagues eight to one .
that is making smart use of public money .
it has not been easy for them to take the sole responsibility of running our family owned business in my absence .
second , by improving the integration of medical services so that family physicians , specialists and other health professionals may work together more effectively .
when you do not have that one of the consequences is a regionalization of your lower house .
carrying through on our red book promises over the past four years resulted in an intensive focus on criminal law issues to improve public safety .
i say to the prime minister and to the minister of fisheries that they should really get involved in this B.C. situation and try to resolve it .
does the minister realize that a lack of national standards for policing our ports will make them much more inviting to criminal elements ?
i am encouraged by the member ' s vigorous pursuit of this issue .
first I refer to Beauchesne ' s sixth edition , citation 3 which outlines some elements of the Constitution Act :
when will the Prime Minister respond to the Quebec premier ' s request for an urgent meeting to follow up on this issue and ensure Mirabel ' s development ?
the foundation of that plan is to balance the books .
would the government confirm information to the effect that ministers of the Crown , despite the RCMP investigation , continued to accompany the person or persons being investigated , in the course of fundraising activities and visits to businesses in Quebec ?
they know that for aboriginal people the incidence of TB and diabetes is two to three times higher than it is for other Canadians and they do not accept this .
i believe that practice will now be expedited by the government .
the Speaker :
Mr. Preston Manning
that is what this job is all about .
rights OF PARENTS
federalists won a majority of votes compared to 38 percent for the other side .
sixth , they do not want ancillary benefits to jeopardize the principal benefit , being the pension income .
i have had medicare and maternity benefits , labour legislation , health and safety legislation , the security of CPP , employment insurance and employment equity .
none of this will change if Bill C - 4 is passed .
as the member for Argenteuil - Papineau , I have spoken out on numerous occasions in defence of the development of Mirabel airport , which is located in my riding .
they sat on my executive and were very wise counsel on many issues , in particular when in the last parliament the New Democratic Party did not have a lot of resources .
i wish we could do this without having to listen to inaccurate Reform rhetoric and truncated history lessons that leave out the four critical years of stunningly successful fiscal management .
there are some members of this House who do not think it is important to protect 225,000 disabled Canadians through the Canada pension plan .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
it is up to the departments to apply the act and we will support these amendments as soon as they come forward .
however , it is in stark contrast to the balanced and fiscally responsible approach of the previous Liberal government which made a commitment to first balance the budget , protect important social programs and then in a climate of fiscal prudence look at the balance between enhancement and maintenance of the programs that we value in our society and those which have made us number one in the world and a 50 % approach to using surpluses for the purposes of debt and tax relief .
on October 1 , 1996 the minister publicly embraced Mr. Dubin ' s findings when he stated " We took the trouble to have a person of unquestioned reputation look carefully through all the facts of this matter .
i believe this debate will be a turning point in our children ' s attitudes toward our generation .
i would like to outline some of the changes which distinguish the new bill from its previous incarnation in the last Parliament , that is Bill C - 72 .
they created this crisis called the Canada pension plan .
i firmly believe Canada will never solve its national unity problem until we have dealt fairly with our aboriginal population .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
given comparable premiums in constant dollars , will the pensions young people receive on retiring be comparable to those of people now receiving benefits under the plan ?
madam Speaker , I thank my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois for a question which is dear to my heart , since it is a given that I have been actively involved in Quebec politics for 25 years .
QUEBEC PREMIER
when the current minister was agriculture minister , he was naturally put in charge of the Canadian Wheat Board .
third is the principle of tolerance toward individuals and groups .
it will not relieve the stress on families trying to juggle several jobs , the responsibilities they have for the care of their children and the obligation they feel for their communities and their involvement in community life .
hon. Paul Martin
Canadian voters will probably be stuck with the Liberals embarking on a special interest group spending spree wasting money on the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council while they claw back seniors pensions and increase the CPP premiums for workers .
over the last four years we had a lot of constructive debate together and I still feel that when we work in a constructive way that is when we achieve the most .
let us look now at what we can accomplish together for our country and especially for our youth .
Mr. Speaker , as I have said on numerous occasions in the House already , I believe that the appointment process for Supreme Court of Canada justices has provided us with some of the most distinguished jurists serving in the highest court of the land .
Ms. Alexa McDonough :
hon. Andy Scott
universit 脡 DU QU 脡 BEC 脌 CHICOUTIMI
this will mean that the advance statements by the questioners will be shorter .
however , in my view it does not fulfil the requirements for an emergency debate at this time .
half goes to Corbeil and the other half to the other one .
madam Speaker , we simply do not agree with the government and it has nothing to do with the 50:50 ratio .
Mr. Peter Stoffer
it will take measures to support Canadians in responding to the expanding needs for home care and community care .
who then would have believed that I would be joining Canada ' s premiers in a spirit of co - operation in the fall of 1997 to discuss how we could help our youth , how we could improve our health system , how we could strengthen our social programs in an era of balanced budgets ?
Telefilm Canada has its work cut out for it .
among average taxpayers , a vast majority favoured tax reductions and by 28:1 they favoured cuts in personal income taxes .
not only did the Reform Party dramatically increase its support , but I would also point out that the whole issue of taxation and cutting taxes resonated from Canadians coast to coast .
despite the recommendations and announcements of the government on its intentions in the throne speech , the crisis continues .
the government waited for days , hoping no questions would come .
in addition , it recently announced the youth internship program in the federal public sector .
the proposed changes were the result of a lengthy consultation process with provincial and territorial governments , professionals in the actuarial and insurance professions , representatives of social planning organizations , seniors , young people and other Canadians .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
they have to agree .
it was a matter of debate .
Mr. Speaker , I made my views very clear .
each year , my constituents make contributions to the election campaign .
Ms. Wasylycia - Leis :
senator Pat Carney is unaccountable because she does not have to go to the people every four years .
the Speaker :
jobs were created although during the period in which he made this announcement jobs were lost in Ontario .
the conclusion was that they advised the Government of Alberta not to go for tax cuts .
obviously I could talk about a number of other items .
but it was not melodious enough to lull me , because it rang false all the way through .
- Canadian Heritage , Votes 1 , 5 , 10 , 15 , L 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , 40 , 45 , 50 , 55 , 60 , 65 , 70 , 75 , 80 , 85 , 90 , 95 , 100 , 105 , 110 , 115 , 120 , 125 , 130 , 140 and 145
second , the government will ensure that the national unity debate is conducted with clarity and frankness .
the Prime Minister cannot justify having patronage appointed Liberals on this patronage granting committee .
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
statistics Canada provides all the background information .
i exhort all of my colleagues in the House to fix not on the past but on the future , to be fully receptive to new ideas and proposals regardless of the source so that we may bring lasting closure to this issue .
we will consult with Canadians as we have in the past .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel ( Secretary of State ( Science , Research and Development ) ( Western Economic Diversification ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
we check out the reliability of businesses .
how many people have gone around in ridings during the campaign saying " You vote for me and I will get you this , I will get you that .
parents are trying to give their children what they need to flourish .
international SENIORS DAY
miss Deborah Grey
i recognize we cannot do as the NDP always wants to do , which is to write cheques and never find any way of paying the bills .
* * *
we certainly need to put more effort into that .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
they cannot argue out of both sides of their mouths all the time .
on the matter of a member ' s constituency duties , Speaker Sauv 茅 pointed out in a decision delivered on July 15 , 1980 , at pages 2914 and 1915 of the Debates :
of those who chose to send us here
* * *
we know that .
it propagates myths around Canada .
the government is committed to ensuring that Canadians get the most value for their dollars .
we are different .
when you privatize it , the rent doubles and triples and the people are out on the street .
it is time for Canada to do the same .
it reflects a consensus for change and a shared commitment to ensure that the CPP is there , that it is sustainable and affordable for today ' s working Canadians and for our children .
i pledge to them that I will once again do my utmost to bring their concerns to this honourable House .
the way to build a strong country is not to recognize that each individual group makes a people , but to recognize that through our diversity we are equal .
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia ) :
that being said , I would like to ask the government how it intends to give Canadian businesses the assurance that their requests for assistance from the government will nevertheless be confidential , considering what we heard this week .
we are committed to the duty of government and we most certainly recognize the fact that the challenge of any government is to build a road for its citizens that will lead to a sense of self - satisfaction , a sense of self - esteem and a sense of fulfilment .
i have here the list of contributions to my campaign .
if management does not act now , we are going to see destruction , both physical and human , that will put the $ 3.1 million Headingley riot to shame .
they want the government to focus on our health care system , a system that has come to define us as a nation .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
we therefore recognize - and I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has read the National Assembly motion - that the anglophone community , or the English speaking community as they chose to put it , is entitled to its educational structures , to schooling from kindergarten to the university level , according to a criterion found in article 73 of the Charter of the French Language .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and support the celebrations of world rural women ' s day on October 15 .
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett
some hon. members :
there are a couple of things I cannot resist commenting on .
Mr. Lee Morrison
in any future statutory review of the plan , new default provisions will identify the steps necessary if the chief actuary calculates the CPP to be no longer sustainable at the steady state rate and ministers cannot reach a consensus on actions to sustain the plan .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
they are very much like the Liberals in this , full of vague promises and no set objectives .
Mr. Speaker , they are investigating a very specific case .
Mrs. Maud Debien
at the national level there are benefit linked contributions to social security in programs of unemployment insurance and the Canada pension plan '' .
under such conditions Canada could become a patchwork quilt of provinces with different powers .
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) :
* * *
as well we have some spending to do to assist Canadians with respect to health care , education and youth unemployment .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i was honoured to participate on September 13 with the Lieutenant - Governor and the minister of health for Ontario as we celebrated together this splendid new facility .
to be sure , because of our unique Canadian society we cannot transplant these solutions here but surely we can learn something from their experiences .
1997 marks the 50 th anniversary of the repeal .
two , is he also correct in the purpose of the amendment that he has offered to the House along with other members ?
i trust that very soon it will be punished when Canadian voters once again get the chance , just like it was punished in the last election when it lost 30 members .
it seems to be a backward step in the age of global economy and privatization .
contents
certainly when the chief actuary reported that there was a tremendous imbalance in the relationship between the contributions on the one hand and the payouts on the other hand and that it would not be a long sustainable plan , the finance minister took it upon himself to make certain corrections were made .
can the minister tell the House , so as to clarify matters , who will be responsible for policing Montreal ' s airports ?
while it caters to the bank , families are suffering .
in recent years , the Liberals and Conservatives have literally emptied the riding of Lotbini 猫 re of all federal services .
what I am asking the Prime Minister is what he did , what action he has taken , since his minister took action .
some hon. members :
it is the result of the consensus I have been talking about for the past several minutes .
the second assumption is that if a government must intervene it has to be the federal government . " We ' re the ones who have to intervene , no one else '' .
prayers
the Speaker :
in addition to cutting back funding , it did nothing to encourage culture .
i believe in that school which has all along claimed that it is the privilege of all subjects , whether high or low , whether rich or poor , whether ecclesiastic or laymen , to participate in the administration of public affairs , to discuss , to influence , to persuade , to convince - but which has always denied , even to the highest , the right to dictate to the lowest .
canada PENSION PLAN
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
i point out to hon. members that this is a five minute period of questions and comments following on a 10 - minute speech .
house OF COMMONS
i know in my instance , the Farm Credit Corporation having just gone through a major shake - up and a major reorganization in my area , has not really seen any dramatic growth or have I heard people saying " You are doing a much better job '' .
Mr. Speaker , most importantly I have raised the matter with the Israeli government .
* * *
four thousand men used to work there .
it has responded to the needs of Canadians and to the needs of the constituents in Etobicoke North .
our government is investing in such programs as CAPE to ensure that more students have better opportunities in finding jobs and more opportunities to learn the skills that they will need in building Canada ' s future .
the NDP member mentioned that it was in good faith that he supported patriation of the Constitution in 1982 because , he says , 74 Liberals representing Quebec said it was all right .
in 1993 they approved 69 % .
after that time , the road the government chose was one of massive overspending and mortgaging our future to borrow the money .
if I had one goal to set for myself in this chamber it would be that I could contribute to my province , contribute to my nation , in much the same way that Jim McGrath did .
i assume that it is written over the Prime Minister ' s door " If you send it we will spend it '' .
certainly , Mr. Speaker .
Mr. Bill Matthews :
the optimal size of government cannot be arbitrarily determined .
Mr. Speaker , the axeman seldom woos his victims , but that is what the Minister of Finance is doing , since he is responsible for poverty in Canada .
paired
even the auditor general said that the government was at best naive about the failed results of TAGS .
i make that pledge .
i have heard from my constituents of Etobicoke - Lakeshore that they want to feel secure in their homes and in their communities .
acid RAIN
Mr. Knowles ' contributions to this House and to Canada are well known .
* * *
we want to act as prudent managers in order to make sure that our financial situation is good in Canada and that we have low interest rates .
nothing more should be read into it .
Monday , October 6 , 1997
( the House divided on the motion , which was agreed to on the following division : )
point four on the form states one of those circumstances as " to a member of Parliament '' .
Mr. Preston Manning
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) :
my job in the government is to provide programs and services to a number of people who are most vulnerable .
of course not because the single largest tax expenditure is the RRSP which most Canadians rely on for their retirement savings .
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
that may be distressing , but that ' s life .
an hon. member :
earlier , during question period , when the transport minister was asked if the RCMP would remain in Mirabel and Dorval , he said that there would be no devolution of powers to Quebec police forces in that area .
Mr. Speaker , let me thank my colleague across the way for this excellent question .
i was most disappointed that the government did not take an opportunity to put into the throne speech some sort of final offer selection dispute settlement mechanism .
environment
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
does the minister realize this ?
we must start trying to understand the situation in which rural communities find themselves .
every instance of duplication and overlap in programs entails administration costs borne by taxpayers .
however , it is becoming extremely difficult due to the rules governing RRSPs which are preventing Canadians from getting maximum potential returns on investment .
the corporate sector recognizes that if government can be moved out of the way there is a profit to be made in the offering of what is now a public service .
francophones OUTSIDE QUEBEC
let me quote directly from the throne speech , " The government is determined to do more to support innovation and risk - taking in Canada and to attract more foreign investment in knowledge based industries to Canada .
this is not simply the view of business people and workers , although that should be sufficient for the government to take heed .
i believe , as I stated in my speech , that Canada is comprised of peoples from all over the world , gathered together in the country of Canada .
Mr. Monte Solberg
we are now in the process of drafting an amendment to the Tobacco Act .
they were here and I was not .
hear , hear .
Mr. Speaker , the very competence of our foreign affairs department is being called into question .
senator PAT CARNEY
we are excited by the kinds of programs we see .
we now have an indication from an officer of the court in Montreal that the RCMP issued a search warrant on or about June 12 , 1997 , this time at 400 Place d ' Youville where the regional minister ' s office is located .
bank OF CANADA
as members know , I did not take my MP pension .
if all three conditions were met , the minister would recommend the exclusion and the governor in council would pass the legislation .
income TAXES
but the Reform Party would not understand that .
is it the member ' s intention to propose concrete solutions to his Liberal caucus for improving things for our young people , to enable them to find satisfying work that complements their studies at CEGEP or university ?
no matter how old we get we each want to gain the approval of our parents .
Mr. Daniel Turp
it is clear that should another province bring forward a request to replace its denominational school system or to otherwise change the constitutional guarantees of its minorities the Government of Canada would once again insist that a reasonable degree of support be demonstrated by the affected minorities .
so over the period of our term we will have given more back to medicare .
Mr. Dick Proctor :
as I mentioned earlier in my speech , even places in British Columbia and Alberta have their problems , but in Atlantic Canada we have serious problems .
during that time Mr. Ellis was very well served by his excellent speaking ability , an ability for which he won both oratory prizes and debating trophies , culminating in a trip to Guelph , Ontario , where he walked away with the Canadian debating championship .
would he please share with the House once again the expert ' s view on pension plans .
however , on his arrival , Brian , the hon. member ' s spiritual leader , whom he obviously dare not name , threw himself into lavish spending so that , in its final year in government , the Conservative Party had a deficit of $ 44 billion and an accumulated debt of $ 600 billion .
Mr. Speaker , it is the reference of legislation to a committee .
the aboriginal people make contributions to the development and building of these homes .
at present , one hour of programming costs on average $ 37,500 on the English network and $ 18,390 on the French network .
does the minister realize that his haphazard approach greatly penalizes the companies and workers who make the contributions , and the unemployed , who are truly unemployed , not just sort of unemployed ?
if they have money left over in their budget , let them give it back to the provinces from whom they stole it in the last budget .
we proposed positive reforms to the criminal justice system and tax cuts that will stimulate employment .
when I chat with them and their friends I hear that they are concerned about the future and whether there will be pension plan for them .
i mentioned to members yesterday that I had a folder full of things that constituents had sent to me over the summer that they would surely hear about as we went on through the business of this House .
we had to not bring in our amendments at clause by clause stage .
i rise to address this House as the honoured representative of the people of the riding of Sydney - Victoria in Cape Breton .
Mr. Speaker , once again , we , in Quebec , are misunderstood .
in this new economy , knowledge , innovation and creativity are the keys to preserving and enhancing prosperity .
bill C - 2 and the $ 11 billion tax grab on ordinary Canadians without reducing employment insurance premiums will create further impediments to job growth .
we will help by offering career planning and employment opportunities .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
we pay bankers $ 46 billion a year .
that is why the government moved in this direction .
one of Canada ' s chartered banks has recently undertaken a comprehensive national study of the attitudes of Canada ' s nexus generation who are young people between the ages of 18 and 35 .
Mr. Peter Stoffer :
Mr. Bryon Wilfert
we would have preferred his victory to ours .
( official Version )
we had an example here today in which the auditor general commented on employment insurance .
i say to him and to his colleagues that I very much look forward to working with him on this important file to the benefit , ultimately , of Canadians and the Canadian economy .
we are .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
a second conclusion must also be reached : after going after the deficit at the expense of the unemployed and the most disadvantaged members of society , by hacking savagely at transfer payments to the provinces for health and education and at unemployment insurance , now this government has the gall , the indecency , to make use of the surpluses generated by its own cutbacks to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction .
by the way , some of my colleagues on the other side of the House would do well to listen .
that would save the Liberal Party ' s skin .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien :
the Speech from the Throne reaffirmed the commitment of the Liberal government to issues that matter to all Canadians : jobs , health care , safe streets and national unity .
the member talks about the brain drain .
i had 4,000 people working at my shipyard , some as plumbers , some as electricians .
it seemed the hon. member was asking questions of the Leader of the Opposition .
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - Orl 茅 ans , BQ ) :
the matter was approved by the local human resources development administration on January 22 , 1997 .
the Government will work with the provinces , universities and colleges , the high - tech industry and other rapidly growing sectors to better forecast the number and types of jobs that will be available and to develop a plan for ensuring that people are appropriately educated to fill them .
i believe there is a question of privilege .
Mr. Speaker , I wish to ask the government House leader to advise this House as to the nature of the government ' s business for the remainder of this week and business for next week .
* * *
otherwise we are turning in circles .
i look forward to a long tenure with you .
even that will be improved in this legislation and the government will continue to guarantee the initial price .
it is a party that does not really believe that the government ' s role in this country is to help create the equality of conditions for our citizens .
i wish to pay tribute to the founders of Saint - R 茅 mi de Lac - aux - Sables and to all those contributing to the success of the festivities surrounding this 100 th anniversary .
the LATE ALISTAIR FRASER
as part of the CPP consultations and review there were discussions about eliminating the death benefit .
i am sure that hon. members know if they will examine their hearts that in a few year ' s time when young people form the majority in this country they are going to be sorely tempted to change the plan to ensure that they will get some of the benefits that will now only go to some people who are currently in the plan .
* * *
the proposed legislation would once again have given the federal government greater power to interfere in order to protect the marine environment and reduce atmospheric pollution , to name just two sectors .
the new system is supposed to help these people back into the job market , so that they are no longer dependent on it .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz
he was an outstanding expert on the procedures and the rules of the House .
it is as though Pierre Elliott Trudeau never left this place .
Ron says he was contacted in his hotel by the police and told that as a Canadian he should stay indoors because his safety might be threatened .
another 35 cents should be used to pay back the benefits stolen from the unemployed , last January , through the employment insurance reform .
they gave us a vote of confidence in the last election in which they said to this government " we want you back , we like your balanced approach , we respect the fact that there needs to be spending on social and economic priorities , we know that there is an issue of getting the debt under control and we are concerned about the level of taxation '' .
that is an exact quote from the text of my speech .
and we only react to what it does .
first , the farm organization which represents the producers of that commodity must make a formal written request for the inclusion .
to be successful in this doubling of the number of companies which will be in the export business , it will also mean harnessing the energy and talent of our women entrepreneurs , for one - third of Canadian firms today are either owned or led by women entrepreneurs , firms that are providing almost two million jobs for Canadians across the country .
there are additional reasons to be confident that entry of the new fund will not disrupt capital markets .
Mr. Speaker , I start by congratulating Mr. Speaker and his peers on ascending to the chair once again .
obviously , the Minister of Finance must approve the plan .
you wonder who really has their hand on the tiller .
the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs .
i am happy to have moved from one political party to another .
we do not regard , nor do most of the provinces regard , mere administrative agreements which vary from province to province and do not exist in half of the provinces , as being anywhere near recognition of provincial responsibility in these areas .
this has to do with adding two members of Parliament to two different committees .
they approved of the government ' s plan to invest in key areas of the economy such as trade and technology , but they urged caution , calling for wise investments that produce results .
why is that ?
and more than five members having risen :
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to reassure the opposition about this very important matter .
proudly we talk about our systems , our lifestyle and everything we have in this great country .
we shall also establish a network of centres of excellence for children to encourage and to bring together research about children ' s needs so that we might know better how to help .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
the cost of exclusion is far greater than the amounts we have committed to these programs .
oh , oh .
* * *
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan
i implore the members of the House to work with me as we identify a new framework , a new capacity to work productively , proactively and strategically together with First Nations leadership , to build a new relationship and a strong future for all Canadians .
yes , we have another agenda .
Mr. Speaker , a few months ago , the former solicitor general explained in this House , in relation to the Airbus affair , that the way the system works , the first thing that happens when there is an investigation is that the RCMP informs the solicitor general , who then decides whether it is appropriate to advise the Prime Minister ' s office .
sir Wilfrid Laurier on the weakness of the previous government ' s legislative program in a debate on the speech from the throne , precisely like this , said : " The speech from the throne has been for some years past a very dry skeleton .
borrowed money outstanding now stands at $ 600 billion , with an annual interest bill of $ 46 billion .
we have the best educated young Canadians in history .
we paid millions of dollars to lose a billion dollars .
the Lortie commission , an important commission which published a report on electoral financing - I have a copy of the report here , but of course I cannot show it to the camera - made several recommendations .
the answer to his question is no , we will not change the area licensing system .
on the other hand , they should be aware of the constraints under which public servants must operate when providing information .
Mr. Yvan Loubier
we will spend time looking at the debt .
therefore I ask , are we prepared to take this country into the next millennium ?
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain
Mr. Janko Peric
what do we find later in his speech ?
he touched a bit on partnerships and private sector funding , but he did not talk about all the good that has been done through internships and because of the fact that we have created internship programs for students .
the hon. member for Saanich - Gulf Islands has the floor .
meanwhile it says that it wants referenda for everything .
we will be working with ICAO and making representations to it about the need to provide a stronger international covenant or convention to ensure that all countries live up to their obligations .
people phoned me yesterday from my riding .
i see some members opposite making light of the recommendation of the Lortie commission .
when we hear the word statistics we quite often lose sight of the fact that those statistics involve people , men , women and children .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
BCE .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
only in Canada would we have this phenomenon .
canada must continue to live , renew and flourish .
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) :
everything is permitted - from dubious practices to partisan appointments .
the public perception of politicians as people who will say anything to get elected and then do whatever they like would disappear if we were truly representing them .
* * *
at the top of the scale is British Columbia , with 620,750 citizens per senator .
* * *
i want to congratulate the hon. member for Nunavut .
what did we get instead ?
why were two contracts worth over a $ 100 million given to two companies , both untendered ?
in the Speech from the Throne the government has offered a positive approach to these issues through strategic investments .
that is the essence of the Speech from the Throne .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie
did the minister inform his colleague , the Minister of Public Works , who is responsible for the Quebec wing of the Liberal Party , of this problem within the Liberal Party ?
i am not asking for another business process review of the House staff and functions , nor do I believe that I should be forced to resort to individuals who have been subjected to four hours of training and are now called legislative clerks .
Mr. Ted McWhinney
Mr. Yvan Loubier
however , the throne speech is not just about idle rhetoric .
it disturbed me greatly then , as it does now , that so many of our citizens have become so discouraged with our politicians and our political system that they have chosen not to exercise the basic rights for which our forefathers fought and died .
does he believe that voluntary measures will help Canada meet its emission reduction goals ?
madam Speaker , the hon. member got his wish .
unlike the federal government , the Government of Quebec is about to recognize a proportionately larger number of persons with a disability .
Mr. Speaker , my colleague was attacking the record of the government in social development and other areas .
take , for instance , Quebec ' s traditional demands regarding manpower training .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
as I mentioned earlier , my riding is very diverse .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to bring National Family Week to the attention of the House .
Wilfrid Laurier opened its doors as a Lutheran seminary in 1911 .
last week in Iqaluit I witnessed the signing of a training agreement between the two governments that will ensure the employment targets are met .
we propose tax relief , in particular tax relief for low income seniors , as the fourth pillar of retirement income .
we have real problems in the province of New Brunswick with political interference from the premier of the province of New Brunswick and those little communities that were supposed to get part of that infrastructure program .
Mr. Preston Manning
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
rather obviously , those solutions failed miserably at that time .
what was the trade - off ?
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) :
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
somebody under the guise of a federal political party that looks as if he is on the up and up should not be able to bully people into making donations .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅
Mr. Speaker , with respect to seniors benefits we are under great consultation now with seniors right across the country .
he is the scapegoat .
our purpose is to ensure that Canadians have what they have enjoyed for 30 years , a publicly funded pension plan that allows everyone earning income -
some of these farmers and their soulmates in the Reform Party and the National Citizens ' Coalition as well continued to use every available opportunity to attack the wheat board as we have heard today in the House of Commons .
i believe all members should focus on it and work toward that objective .
does the hon. member think that this bill , which will increase CPP payroll taxes by 70 percent , by some $ 1,800 for self - employed individuals , by over $ 10 billion a year when fully executed , will help the government to achieve its objective of greater job growth ?
i have developed a great respect for our native peoples and the contribution they make to the overall culture of our country .
madam Speaker , I would like to thank you and your office personally for the excellent opportunity that your office provided at the centre d ' immersion at Saint - Jean - sur - Richelieu .
as has been suggested by members of all parties , none of us are squeaky clean in this .
as to our course of action , in all such cases I consult the ethics commissioner .
does the amendment have the consensus of the Quebec people ?
they have elected me to be part of an honest , responsible government and they demand that the future of the nation , the greatest place in the world in which to live , is assured .
we are in a period of transition .
let us ensure there is no discrimination , no barriers to their advancement and that they enjoy full freedom as defined in the charter .
since 1984 the pay equity issue has been on the table with the Government of Canada .
i would like to draw to your attention the presence in the gallery of two guests .
we all know that under the Standing Orders we are not to make such comments , but I am pleased he mentioned that I am here .
we ask this government to show the same commitment to the people of Cape Breton .
speech FROM THE THRONE
the member talked about the aboriginal people .
Mr. Fraser ' s death robs us of an ally and one of the Commonwealth ' s great parliamentary officers .
the Speaker
what can governments do to invest in their people so that they will have the opportunities and that Canada and our standard of living will be better for it ?
now they are saying they pay more than their fair share .
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister talks about a little respect for the truth .
this is absolutely appalling and unacceptable .
it is a $ 1.6 billion problem , and that problem is auto theft .
the Speaker :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to shed some light on certain comments made regarding the role of the federal government in the case of the Montfort hospital .
such is the strategy of the federal government : to make Quebec look like the bad guy when it comes to social programs and to the health sector , when in fact they are the main ones responsible .
Mr. Peter Stoffer :
madam Speaker , congratulations to you on your appointment as Acting Speaker .
all were winners as they experienced people , plants and pride growing together .
it was standard practice .
i do not think we can continue to rely on the solutions of the past .
working together , Baldwin and Lafontaine brought us responsible government .
by working together we are tackling a problem which no one order of government can solve alone .
i have had a unique opportunity to see firsthand the entrepreneurship and dynamism of Canadians at work from coast to coast .
this is unacceptable .
i want to work constructively with her in what I know is a shared objective of ensuring the health of Canadians but she is making it very difficult from the beginning .
almost 13 million documents have been accessed through Strategis , which is available to Canadians instantly on the Internet .
i hope that is not his objective because that would be wrong .
its hands are tied .
we also have to understand that governments like Ontario that are laying off thousands of people are contributing to the net .
let us get this straight .
Mr. Speaker , we have heard a lot today about financial skulduggery .
Mr. Maurice Dumas
one of those powers is that it must ratify any constitutional amendment .
Mr. Michel Gauthier
they are more concerned about the economy and they want to get on with building this great nation .
of course we have responsibility for defence , since we are a large country with defence responsibilities .
be it through information and training or through innovative programs , the Centre des femmes de Laval brings women together to discuss their individual situations , look for solutions and , more importantly , break down the isolation women often unwillingly find themselves in .
in particular the prime minister embraced the idea that this parliament and the government will be taking this nation into the 21 st century .
the Government will work with its provincial and territorial partners to establish jointly a common timetable for increasing the federal contribution to the Canada Child Tax Benefit by at least an additional $ 850 million during the course of this mandate .
the section in the throne speech on unity is extremely brief .
Mr. Steve Mahoney :
i believe the people of Canada expect from this government continued prudent fiscal management .
i am introducing two private members ' bills today , both dealing with the Criminal Code .
the Minister of Human Resources Development we know filed his concerns and complaint with the RCMP back in March .
what can we do to help our own businesses to grow and what can we do to help communities so that we could employ more individuals ?
are they going to be concerned about clawbacks to seniors pensions ?
when we take a look at the unemployment rates in the country we are in the same situation .
would they rather have preferential rates and a loan from the Mouvement Desjardins ?
Mr. John Maloney
when I became a member of this House , in 1984 , Mr. Knowles had just ended his last term as an active member of Parliament .
compassion is something we all should have within the House .
at the same time , the hon. member for Medicine Hat tells us that they plan to cut taxes .
but oh no , we should trust them .
what are our priorities ?
here is a perfect opportunity for Reform Party members .
i do not believe the government is up to that challenge but prove me wrong if I am wrong .
it means that we have to compete with the best .
* * *
he says that , at the time the Constitution was patriated , there were members who voted in favour .
my question is directed to the Prime Minister .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
the Reform solution is to reduce taxes only when a budget surplus has been attained .
the hon. member should acknowledge that the government introduced a measure to eliminate internal trade barriers .
Mr. Speaker , the government clearly supports pay equity , since it passed legislation on the matter in 1978 .
it is true that some aspects of financing need to be improved .
we know that the proposed amendment enjoys a reasonable degree of support from those who will be affected by it .
once new ideas , such as the federal union , the national policy or the transcontinental railway , were by that point in time the status quo .
Mr. Speaker , I have a supplementary .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
closer to us - and at the time I was a member of this House - we used section 42 with regard to the construction of the bridge linking Prince Edward Island to the mainland .

hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Reg Alcock ( Winnipeg South , Lib . ) :
now the government is very proud of the fact that it is headed toward a fiscal surplus .
that is what the House is really all about .
health CARE
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay :
this is why I wish to react to the changes proposed to the Canada pension plan .
penitentiaries
looking at the bill it is certainly highly questionable whether the board of directors will ever be able to make the Canadian Wheat Board voluntary .
we believe it is in the interest of the people at Dorval and Mirabel to keep the RCMP at the airport during this period of change .
main ESTIMATES , 1997 - 98
according to someone much more familiar with the rules of the House than the Chair , there is no such requirement .

representing one ' s constituents well is no small challenge and I know that each of us , with God ' s help , will carry out our duties conscientiously , with respect for the institutions we serve and , of course , for the citizens of our country , Canada .
how does the Prime Minister explain the complete and utter failure of the program and the damage it has done to Atlantic Canadians ?
in the end , thousands of people paid the bill , and the provinces bore the political pressure .
my guess is that it will be increased in the next budget or the budget after that .
that is Liberal economics .
another aspect of the economy is that our supply of those graduates is very low .
could that be described as democratic ?
i would also like to thank the members of my constituency of Cariboo - Chilcotin for participating in the democratic process of the June election , in particular those who worked to support my candidacy and my election .
that having been said , the Leader of the Opposition knows very well that the motion tabled in the National Assembly states very clearly that we do not recognize the Constitution Act , 1982 , for a number of reasons , and with the support of a number of analysts in English Canada , who studied its impact .
has the minister had time to consider this ?
Mr. Speaker , it is a great pleasure for me to address the House today .
many people have simply given up looking for work and have been forced to go on welfare .
my question is for the Prime Minister .
as parliamentarians , we all know how difficult this is to achieve , that unanimity in Parliament seldom occurs .
but is it true , I ask my colleague , if he wants one people for one country , that it must be a nation like Canada .
i am quite surprised that the hon. member did not view some of the changes we made to the employment insurance program as improvements to the program .
the throne speech reflects our commitment to thoughtful economic management .
all governments that bring forward their priorities and policies in speeches from the throne do so within the fiscal framework that the country faces at any given time .
the single largest group of Canadians said that is the approach they want .
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) :
hon. Jean J . Charest :
* * *
talk about unfairness and political cynicism .
what our government set out in the Speech from the Throne is nothing more and nothing less than a new economic framework for Canada , a framework based on one idea : seizing the opportunities presented by the global knowledge economy in order to create jobs and wealth in all economic sectors , ranging from high technology to services and primary resources .
throughout the summer my constituents have already been reassured by the efforts of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to bring frankness and clarity to any debate that could put in jeopardy the future of this country .
a fund that invests in this way tends to reflect the composition and the average return of the market as a whole .
why ?
the Liberals are proposing that half the surplus go to paying the debt and to reducing taxes .
the agriculture industry in Simcoe - Grey represents the largest geographical make - up and is the largest single employer in our riding .

the international community knows that Canada is the best country to live in , but the reality of today is that the majority of federal and provincial politicians from Quebec want to leave Canada .
the government has no unpaid debt at the present time .
it is multilingual and multicultural .
as a postscript I note with interest that a number of young people were elected to this House in the last election .
the CPP is a shabby , unfair and unjust scheme for the young and those yet unborn .
Stanley would never have been fooled by euphemisms like seniors benefits into believing that a massive reduction in pension benefits was an improvement .
but unfortunately it seems this is not its intention .
what we are calling for is a little respect from the government .
we feel that it is .

Mr. Bob Mills
she was born on Wednesday and Friday morning I was out .
we will have a debate and witnesses will come .
Mr. Nelson Riis
however , we also have to reduce barriers to post - secondary education and ensure , as well , that young people are able to get that all important first job .
over the summer , like many of my hon. colleagues , I consulted people in my riding , business people , representatives of voluntary organizations , and union organizers from the private sector .
the government pays lip service to promoting jobs for young people but its actions do not support its promises .
one of the few promising aspects of this speech is the federalist propaganda campaign .
as Her Majesty ' s loyal opposition , which we are proud to be , we will continue to make sure that we hold these people accountable for the abuse of some of the funds .
that is why we believe very strongly in a program to start to improve the infrastructure in Atlantic Canada so that we can renew some of the traditional trade ties that Atlantic Canada had when it came into Confederation which at that point made it the strongest part of the country .
unless and until the House collectively decides that it wants to change the standing orders , as your Speaker I am bound to follow the rules .

miss Deborah Grey :
i ask him whether he is looking to the future or to the past .
that having been said , we are governed by a constitutional order and contrary to our will we must , in order to modernize our school system in Quebec , face this obligation before us to use the amending formula .
i congratulate him because he was involved in the same struggle as that fought by our forebears .
reformers have disasters happen where we become disabled and need additional assistance .

hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member .
a Tamil woman in Sri Lanka is a vulnerable person .
they have created a scenario where the pension fund now has a $ 580 billion unfunded liability , an amount that almost exceeds the federal debt .
the prime minister will know that Canadians are very concerned , and they should be .
he does not have to sit and put up with this .
it very clearly showed that the government is picking up where it left off in April , ignoring the needs of farmers .
nevertheless , Canadians are worried about the prospects for youth .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te
because we know that the future of this country belongs to our youth and we need to provide them with the right opportunities .
does the minister recognize how awful this situation is in view of the importance of the information highway for the future ?
we have the largest downhill ski area in Ontario , the friendliest and best run in North America .

i also congratulate on you your appointment .
i wish to pay tribute today to the organizations and volunteers who work toward improving the lives of all seniors in my riding and the quality of life of all of my constituents .
the tragedy is that very little of that thinking is seen at all in the government ' s program or in the speech from the throne .
instead , they are in advance saying they going to spend 50 percent of the surplus .
hon. David M. Collenette
the gun control of the government will no doubt make criminals out of millions of otherwise law - abiding Canadians across the land .
introduction and first reading
today I was able to table a private member ' s bill which deals with a problem in my riding , joy riding .
a number of the principal features of the CPP remain unchanged .
the hon. member for Sherbrooke is an experienced member and knows he cannot cover his address to the Chair by saying Mr. Speaker and then saying you to somebody else .
these brave men and women were required to train for eight rigorous weeks and went on to serve honourably at radar stations in Europe , Asia , Africa , Arabia , India , China and other Far East countries .
it depends on developments that may or may not occur and that are subject to the free decision of Quebeckers , their political authorities , and the appraisal of Canada , its political authorities , whether France will be asking this type of question .
hon. Jim Peterson :
residents were united in their desire for the government to stay the course on deficit reduction .
in the case of the proposed Quebec amendment , no provincial referendum has been held .
i want to thank Herb Grubel who represented Howe Sound before me .
i must say that I am very pleased to be sitting on this side of the House at this time , and I am very proud to have heard the message from the government and the Prime Minister , for a number of reasons .
consideration must be given to the imposition of more minimum sentences , allowing communities access to the briefing of federal judges and passing legislation to require the proceeds of crime to be reinvested into those communities affected .
the Regina plains he found so inhospitable that many years ago have now become one of the best grain growing regions in the world .
can this minister not stand up in this House and say that it is not the policy of this government to pursue and chase down severely disabled Canadians in the courts to try to squeeze money out of them ?
there were good committees of the House that sat and worked very hard .
broadcasting
if the hon. member really wanted to know those interest rates and if he really wanted to know the exact portion - and he is a very clever colleague - he would have given that question to me in writing and he would have known that I would have had the answer for him .
the message I am trying to get through to some of those who do not listen well on the other side is that this kind of stuff is not going to go away .
does the hon. member believe that every member of Parliament should participate in that process ?
they are very poor people and are living hand to mouth .
does the solicitor general still contend that he was not informed by the RCMP because they did not feel it was appropriate to let him know about an investigation into the government ' s integrity ?
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te
the fiduciary responsibility that we have as the crown with aboriginal people must be reflective of responsibility and sharing .
* * *
Mr. Speaker , I have personal knowledge of the awful tragedy to which the hon. member refers .
what producers want is a government that is not going to hide behind the CTA hearing in an effort to prolong the initiative .
it is one that I believe does strike the balance that the Minister of Justice refers to .
madam Speaker , it is strange , but -
at the same time the multilateral agreement on investment which we are negotiating currently with the OECD will provide us with a secure and stable framework of rules for Canadians investing abroad .
i talked about the debt , taxes and irresponsible spending .
by doing so we will be sending the signal of support for our young people , thereby ensuring a prosperous future for our country .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask our colleague a question .
in my riding , they would tell her in Inuit :
* * *
we even heard from a Canadian company that actually left Ontario in disgust to move to Michigan .
using the 1996 census population figures , that works out to a Canadian average of 277,373 citizens per senator .
Mr. Richard Marceau
i would have been hard pressed not to have given it to them , but had I done so it would have been another $ 650 per employee for the equivalent of 10 full - time employees or $ 6,500 , the gross profit from another house .
they should not be able to further overload the legal system with frivolous litigation , particularly at taxpayer expense .
it is often said that children are our most precious asset .
the business groups that have been consulted to date include the Canadian Chamber of Commerce , the Canadian Council of International Business and the Business Council for National Issues .
our system presupposes that the elected members be the real opposition to government legislation .
Papineau fought to ensure that his people , and not some unelected individuals , decide the future .
this speaks volumes for Canada , the best country in the world in which to live .
CPP contributions are tax deductible and therefore a tax deductible process that is put in place for the future of Canadians , for seniors of today .
it knows this is one of the problems with the plan , but it has done nothing about it .
first of all , by reorganizing primary care .
so I would ask the hon. member to make the necessary distinctions , for these are two distinct debates with nothing in common at this time and I wish the hon. member did not really want the committee to proceed as she is suggesting .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
she should apologize for what she did .
but governing in the 21 st century also means recognizing that no one government can act alone .
Mr. Myron Thompson
my constituents are aware of the commitment by the Liberal government to move on denaturalization and on deportation of those convicted of war crimes .
there are aspects of the speech that provide hope for unemployed Saultites .
hon. Allan Rock
the Government will explore innovative policies and measures that give particular attention to increasing opportunity for Canadians in rural communities .
in addition , his devotion to language and minority issues is highly regarded .
creating an environment that makes the underground economy more attractive is harmful to all Canadians , and this concerns me a great deal .
you could say he controls the purse strings .
hence there will be ample opportunity to evaluate the fund ' s impact on markets and to make any necessary adjustments .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
as the Leader of the Official Opposition might say , there seemed to be some bone there .
Mr. Speaker , the government of course remains committed to the principles of openness and accountability that are inherent in the Access to Information Act .
it meant they did not have the kind of savings they otherwise would like to have had for retirement , and they had very little .
the Speaker :
because of the miscue before question period , 10 minutes of debate was taken away from the Reform Party .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. leader of the NDP for the question .
i would ask the hon. member for Charlesbourg to please speak without any props .
it being 7.18 p.m. , the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
we are known worldwide as a compassionate society with very liberal values .
we understand the anglophone minority ' s concerns about its demographic situation , about the provisions which limit access to English schools and about the secessionist orientation of the current Quebec government .
i am proud and deeply honoured to be their elected representative for a second time .
military bases have closed in British Columbia .
i also challenge the hon. member to come forth and be positive rather than threatening Canadians across the country .
literally thousands of companies have never sent a representative outside our borders or even sold a single widget or service to a customer in a province west or east of them .
the Speaker :
children with learning and behavioural problems are much more likely to become drop - outs from school and from society .
if something like that occurred I accept responsibility for the simple reason that I -
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
there is no imagination , no vision in this throne speech .
obviously that is one of the reasons why the Liberal Party won every seat , with the exception of one , that of my colleague just in front of me .
there is a huge gap in the reality of what the government is saying , what it is purporting to do and what the reality is that is facing our institutions and students in this country .
the legislation proposes that in future CPP funds will be carefully invested into a diversified portfolio of securities in the best interests of plan members , like other pension funds .
captain Palliser was wrong .
Mr. Speaker , I wish to present a petition signed by 25 constituents in Carleton - Gloucester .
i welcome the opportunity this morning to elaborate on our plans and on our objectives .
however , given the government ' s potential liability over inappropriate disclosure of confidential information to third parties , the Access to Information Act is used for guidance on the informal release of information .
house OF COMMONS
Tuesday , October 21 and Thursday , October 23 shall be allotted days .
agreed .
as it is almost 2 p.m. I have two things to do .
it offers the majestic Niagara escarpment rolling down into the pristine waters of Georgian Bay .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
where was his compassion ?
is that how the minister treats employees who try to expose fraud , waste and corruption in his department ?
the Pic River First Nation submitted a land claim and this claim was rejected after a legal review by the Department of Justice .
Mr. Ken Epp
it is as if he is trying to say to me , coming from 200 years of United Empire Loyalists stock , someone who has lived in three provinces of this country , who lived 32 years in this province before moving west , that I am not dedicated to keeping this country together .
canada can no longer compete in the unskilled manufacturing sector with the emerging economies around the world which offer low wages , relaxed labour standards and fewer environmental controls .
the public ' s view was that it was after the fact consultation .
i have no trepidation in saying that in years to come I will be glad and so will many of my constituents that the benefits and fruits of this nation will be shared for generations to come .
the pain has to stop .
the budgetary surpluses during this mandate will be the source of funding for new programs .
foreign Affairs
there are many of them .
the first question I asked was , is there a problem ?
however , in April of this year just before the federal election was called , tragedy struck her family .
my constituents understand and appreciate the past but they also have an eye on the future .
in 1968 , Daniel Johnson senior said that " a new Constitution should be so devised that Canada is not just a federation of 10 provinces , but a federation of two nations equal in law and in fact '' .
in instances where members have claimed that they have been obstructed or harassed , not directly in their roles as elected representatives but while being involved in matters of a political or constituency related nature , Speakers have consistently ruled that this does not constitute a breach of privilege .
in Canada , women hold 75 percent of the ten lowest paying jobs ; 36 percent of women work part time , because they are unable to find full time jobs .
we both know that time is very important in politics .
these are the Government ' s priorities .
we are dealing with human lives and futures .
by limiting the foreign content to 20 percent the returns are being limited .
he had a pretty remarkable career .
Mr. Bob Speller
it appears that the program is ending .
yesterday the Prime Minister talked of trying to help youngsters get on to the other side of the fence , to lower the fence and to help them see the other side which as he said is always greener .
introduction and first reading
i know that the spirit of the citizens of the Atlantic provinces is very much the same .
Mr. Allan Kerpan
i would also like to salute the small community of Joly , where I come from .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
during the five past years , Quebec stocks held by the Caisse have yielded 3 percent more than the total Canadian stock index , that is , 19.3 percent , and this has helped the Caisse not only to guarantee the security of its assets , but also to maximize the return on investments made to provide pensions for the workers who contributed .
it had an opportunity to show leadership with respect to marketing western Canadian grains .
why are we here not more concerned about a government that wants us to do a CPP that will only give a small amount of money ?
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) :
his father left his mark on this institution .
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present a petition on behalf of the people of my riding .
the financial assistance will be used to help implement expansion plans for the small businesses in my area , Montreal ' s south shore .
they ask for cash and they say : " Just shut up , or you won ' t get your grant '' .

the government is determined to find that right balance .
world TEACHERS DAY
we are looking at the 160 recommendations of the Somalia inquiry .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
it proves the old adage of my friend , the member formerly for Beaver River , now from Edmonton North , Liberal - Tory , same old story .
it was an unwritten agreement which stated " as a young person let me pay a reasonable tuition fee and I will help you in your retirement '' .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
we are proud of what we have done for the disabled community and we will continue it .
the government ' s throne speech is filled with talk about children who do not seem to have families , children who seem to be the worthy recipients of government programs designed by the Liberal government ' s social engineers .
i will speak with the candour my constituents expect .
statements BY MEMBERS
i never suggested that .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
my constituents and family provide much of the enthusiasm that fuels my efforts .
speech FROM THE THRONE
they have also left their mark on the hearts of all Canadians , with an undying memory of a people standing up against adversity and reaching out to help those in need .
of course income taxes as we know were supposed to be a temporary tax .
Canadians are counting on us , especially those less well off .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
what we need in this country are decent social programs and a tax system that is fair for each and every ordinary Canadian .
in setting investment policy the board will be subject to fundamentally the same rules as other trustees of pension funds .
second , members opposite have gone on and on about the intergenerational tax .
Mr. Mike Scott
our caucus is going to be fighting to protect what is left of that tattered social safety net .
first of all , it is good to see the decision making power of the Canadian Wheat Board put in the hands of farmers , who represent ten of the 15 members on the board of directors .
i have every confidence that Canada can and will be at the leading edge of sustainable technologies .
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian
* * *
Ms. Claudette Bradshaw
the mission of the CMA is to provide leadership for physicians and to promote the highest standard of health and health care for Canadians .
we must ensure that conditions are such that they can find their place in the sun .
that is the situation .
an hon. member :
then it said that Canadian officials had seen the passports , then that they had not seen the passports but other people had seen them .
foreign Affairs
Mr. Speaker , I too would like to congratulate the member for Dartmouth on her inaugural speech in the House of Commons .
the Speaker :
i point to the throne speech with 29 new spending initiatives and very little reference to paying down the debt or relieving Canadians from the tax burden they carry .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy :
the upshot is that these jobs are not disappearing .
the federal government spends $ 46 billion a year to service the debt .
foreign Affairs has had ample opportunity to investigate .
the provinces that were involved in the negotiations dealing with the changes to CPP earlier this year also recognize and gave approval to the need to move ahead .
they have lost economic opportunity because of the policies of this government .
speech FROM THE THRONE
i want to read the text of the resolution passed by the Quebec Assembly into the record because I think members studying this should have the resolution in front of them .
Susan ' s death was no accident .
they talked about how to convert these defined benefit pension plans into pensions that are fully funded , mandatory private retirement savings vehicles .
i am trying to wave a red flag .
it is the same kind of discourse we heard then , telling us that the federal government would create a just society , that it could spend in all sorts of sectors outside its jurisdiction , and that we were going to see that it would be able to do it much better than any of the provinces or anyone close to the issue and the people .
Mr. Bob Kilger :
veterans
at the same time however it is interesting to note that stock markets in Canada and the United States and industry analysts are discounting the positive impacts of downsizing initiatives .
Mr. Paul Szabo
my third point is that since the new employment insurance system came into effect last January , the benefits and usual protection for workers who lose their jobs were greatly reduced .
i would be lying if I said we are happy with the fact that seven senators will sit on this committee .
orders of the day .
each and every one of us must assume personal responsibility for our community and our country .
there are problems in the way the plan is being presented .
the B.C. Liberals and B.C. Reformers have developed a close political relationship over the past few years and have recently decided to jump into political bed with each other .
last night on national television the fisheries minister admitted that the Liberals " will have to face up to the fact that we still have a restructuring problem '' .
throughout North America , health institutions are sharing services , saving dollars and proving that restructuring can be done without destroying institutions like Women ' s College Hospital and eroding public confidence in the system .
i remember as a kid having my mother read me a story by Robert Louis Stevenson , called The Wreckers where unscrupulous people on a desert island would light fires on the rocks at night to lure ships into thinking it was a harbour .
i have every confidence the government will get where it needs to be .
clearly the CPP was not sustainable and something had to be done .
they agreed that a balanced budget is essential to our nation ' s economic health .
decorum in Chamber
i am a little surprised by the reaction of the Reform Party .
canada ' s young scientists need this equipment to do innovative research , the source of future job growth .
is there cause for concern ?
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) :
by the end of the year , we will have new technologies in place across Canada to help the authorities find instances of drug abuse .
the first speaker referred to the deficit left behind by the Conservatives , which the government succeeded in cutting by $ 42 billion .
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 247 , an Act to amend the Criminal Code ( genetic manipulation ) .
we in the opposition ranks cannot do an adequate job of discussing such a comprehensive piece of legislation in a 10 minute speech .
the member went on to say that francophones outside Quebec could count on her support .
Mr. Speaker , the last time I looked , money is money .
part of their advice was :
has he heard about the prime minister ' s advisory committee on science and technology , a group of particularly talented Canadians who advise wisely on science , innovation and technology so that we can make the very best decisions possible in terms of policy options and in terms of pursuing strategic initiatives and additional partnerships ?
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay
i will conclude by saying that the anglophone ocean now surrounding us continues to try to assimilate us , not realizing that we are a real people .
quite seriously flawed
i happen to be a motorcyclist .
the key work was unaccountable .
where is the equality ?
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner
what is the government doing to combat racism and to reinforce respect for diversity in this country ?
the government says , and I gather with the concurrence of the Government of Quebec , that section 43 is the relevant amending formula .
Yes.
they can spend money very wisely .
and this is the minister who is going to involve the public and the health protection branch in an open and full discussion of its future .
that we have never hidden .
Mr. George Proud :
our multicultural policy was intended to build bridges but it has been manipulated in the past and therefore faces growing criticism today .
when they talk about their code of ethics , we must ask ourselves : what ethics ?
there are a few things the minister referred to which bear reflecting on again .
madam Speaker , the entertainment just does not end .
and more than five members having risen :
if a crime was committed the individual who committed the crime will be prosecuted .
let us have some appreciation for the fact that the small business people are the job creators .
if the minister cannot find additional funds in his department , which he refused to answer , will he then access the $ 12.8 billion in workers funds in the EI surplus account ?
the federalists , in their post - referendum panic and without an argument to stand on , are going after the process , trying to discredit it by all possible means .
in this week ' s throne speech the government talked of partnerships .
French business people too recognize that the political uncertainty generated by the sovereignist threat is hurting Quebec ' s and Canada ' s economy .
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
i tend to do this throughout the year .
would the Prime Minister agree that the throne speech has demonstrated , more clearly than ever before , that there are two diametrically opposed visions of Canada : one in Quebec where , since Jean Lesage , people have wanted to be " ma 卯 tres chez nous " and one in the rest of Canada , the one in the Calgary declaration where Quebecers are just as unique as Pacific salmon ?
there is not an enterprise in this country , or in the rest of the world , that is operating according to rules from the last century .
Canadian voters will probably be stuck with record levels of political patronage using their tax dollars and borrowing against their children ' s futures .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
this again ties into the issue of having more openness , more accountability and more responsibility when it comes to the issue of political fundraising .
he wanted them to vote for him , did he not , or why did he move ?
points OF ORDER
hon. Andy Scott
i am not sure all the issues were considered .
as with any new amendment there is bound to be a bumpy start .
we cannot have it both ways .
i am certainly a pipeline to this caucus and to this government on behalf of the farming community in my riding .
we have to watch him from this side every single day , so we certainly understand what he talks about .
i say this to no specific member , but I say it to all of us so that we will be apprised of the situation .
hon. Paul Martin
the last thing I would like to speak to right now is that of accountability .
perhaps we can never achieve an unemployment rate of 5 percent but perhaps we can .
these are improvements over Bill C - 72 but we do not believe that they go far enough yet .
Mr. Lee Morrison
but that does not mean that we want to drop our national programs .
in English , the only true language of the Liberal party of Canada , `` it ' s the pot calling the kettle black '' .
some hon. members :
they apparently disagree with the concept of youth internship and lifelong learning .
i did not think then that I would be representing Nunavut 22 years later .
i believe we all love and want Quebec in Canada .
there is never an assurance that one day the government will not turn around and change the rules , try to grab that money .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy
the west can take care of its own regional grievances .
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to join this debate .
one line in the throne speech on debt reduction and tax relief and 20 pages on spending increases and no consultation .
how could he , in a major speech he made yesterday , lend such credibility to strategies as yet unknown , to consultations which may or may not be reliable ?
British Columbians , indeed all Canadians outside of Quebec , will have the opportunity to express their feelings about the Calgary declaration over the next few months .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Peter MacKay
this resolution comes from the City of Saint - Eustache .
hon. Christine Stewart
that is why I am tabling that resolution again , so that it can be referred to a special joint committee that is to report to Parliament in the coming weeks .
at last .
we are going to be talking to thousands and thousands of people over the next several months to gather their input .
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) :
in all , youth internship Canada , youth service Canada and the student summer job program have helped over one million young people since 1994 .
Mr. Speaker , it can be confirmed that the two passports are forgeries .
Mr. Jason Kenney
Mr. Speaker , I am honoured , humbled and saddened to pay tribute to Chester MacRae .
nowhere is it written in the Constitution that it has to be decided by Ottawa and enforced by Ottawa .
we can look at the bank tax rates , the bank services charges and their flexibility in charging interest rates to their customers .
i can talk about Atlantic Canada but there are other parts of Canada that are also going through some pretty tough times .
the Chair can therefore entertain the question raised by the hon. member .
obviously we will have to work to convince her in that regard .
it all goes to show that our federation has evolved a great deal .
Mr. Chuck Cadman ( Surrey North , Ref. ) :
in 1988 , he received $ 41,000 from organizations that were not individuals .
patronage appointments abound everywhere .
i am their elected official .
as you may have noticed , and I suppose everybody in this House has , it was largely inspired by the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement du Qu 茅 bec .
it would be an easy matter to raise a series of points of order throughout someone ' s speech so as to prevent him from speaking .
he mentioned in his remarks the 745 hearings .
madam Speaker , I refer to my colleague ' s reference when he talked about public confidence in the court system .
as I was saying , the Prime Minister has an opportunity to do so .
the hon. member says to cut taxes .
Mr. Speaker , the Leader of the Opposition wanted me to speak about equality of the provinces .
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain
we regained that ability , but how will the ultimate decisions be made ?
people who watched the proceedings of the House perhaps remember him in that capacity in his latter years .
* * *
it did not have the nerve to straighten things out and correct things .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
QUEBEC PREMIER
Canadian voters will probably be stuck with the same inadequate justice system which has degenerated under the old line parties into little more than a legal system incapable of protecting them from criminals .
again this was an opportunity for the government to address very real concerns , to open up the board and make it more accountable .
once again , I welcome the hon. member to the Chair .
supply
the health protection branch will continue to fulfil its responsibilities in this regard .
this bill was followed by a revised bill , which was presented last July .
we in Nova Scotia know that dreaded word , harmonizing , very well because we have the harmonized sales tax .
the Minister of Canadian Heritage along with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Transport have taken over the helm of the ship of state - and I am borrowing an analogy which the leader of the Reform Party used yesterday - and decided to go to Sweden because that is where they saw the land of opportunity .
there probably was a lengthy debate , but I am sure that today , some people would prefer to have more than 40 percent of their assets in stocks .
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , today the auditor general devoted three chapters of his report to the Atlantic groundfish strategy .
in the throne speech the government makes a commitment to work with the provinces and territories to advance the progress made in Calgary two weeks ago toward the full recognition of diversity inherent in the federation , including the unique character of Quebec society .
now AlphaStar has gone bankrupt , leaving 6,000 customers stranded without service and stuck with totally useless equipment .
the House resumed from October 6 consideration of the motion that Bill C - 2 , an act to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts , be read the second time and referred to a committee ; and of the amendment .
oftentimes a fresh approach is required .
i believe the hon. member is saying that the procedure relating to a referendum on secession should only be determined by the secessionist government .
criminal CODE
in particular , I think that for those Canadians in other provinces who enjoy rights to denominational schools there has been some concern expressed , for example , by certain Catholic groups in my home province of Ontario .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy
Mr. Denis Coderre
i want to congratulate you and all those who will be occupying the Chair during the course of this Parliament .
* * *
these irate citizens have influenced the minister .
in Ontario the industry drives the system .
that is not what some members of the official opposition were hoping for , which is for producers to join the Canadian Wheat Board one year because it suits them , and leave the next year , because they were able to sell their grain on their own .
one hundred and thirty years of the most distinguished jurors in this country have served on that court .
Mr. Speaker , the next group of petitions are signed by 58 of my constituents who are asking Parliament to make several changes to the way crimes of violence are treated in the law and by the courts .
it is a great privilege to be here .
we are trying to help in a number of ways .
how much autonomy will the Canadian Wheat Board have ?
* * *
it has been reported that the Chr 茅 tien government wants more cuts to the environment , another -
the Speaker
No. Their consultations were limited precisely to the type of plan they wanted to consider .
my concern is with the Canadian pension plan super mutual fund that the government will put in place to manage those moneys .
in Matane , it is over 22 per cent .
Mr. Dale Johnston
this was way below the rates that could have been obtained in the marketplace .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
the plan is much more than simply a pension .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank my hon. colleague across the way .
he should also take a look at the Farm Credit Corporation because its mandate has been expanded .
in fact our caucus at that time in the 35 th Parliament believed that the reference to committee was too hasty .
the question is the timing of those reductions basically because , if we are taking in more money in order to be able to deal with the deficit and certainly the debt - we have a $ 600 billion debt which I hope they would deal with - I would say that the hon. member talks about chequebook politics .
as the present minister and the former minister know , fishers in B.C. were promised flexibility in the expense of an income restrictive area management licensing system .
a lot of the discussions we have had today have been around the investment board .
Mr. Speaker , the government estimated the net worth of the air navigation system as did those negotiating on behalf of Nav Canada .
it gave up control of who can drive on the highway .
the models we build have to be reflective of that responsibility .
hon. Don Boudria
i am exceedingly proud , honoured and humbled to represent this great riding .
Mr. Jim Abbott
suppose that all these three conditions were fulfilled and suppose that the Canadian Wheat Board Act were thus extended so that part III applied to rye , but not part IV.
Mr. Carmen Provenzano :
will the Minister of Finance display a real commitment to openness and transparency and say today that he will see that the new CPP investment board will in fact -
is this not nice ?
* * *
does anyone on that side of the House remember the ill - conceived Canada health and social transfer ?
Mr. Speaker , these are publicly made allegations , publicly reported in the newspapers about fraud , corruption , nepotism and abuse in the department .
talk about your own plan instead of ours .
we know the RCMP is investigating the Liberal Party for its corrupt fundraising practices .
the Youth Strategy has three components : a fund for young entrepreneurs , a program for hiring youth advisors in the CFDCs and the extension of the Summer Employment Program for students .
madam Speaker , I believe that you will find unanimous consent in the House on the following motion :
what the government and its finance minister and the prime minister forgot is that there is only one taxpayer .
finally Canada is taking action .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciated the depth and the analysis of my colleague from Calgary - Nose Hill .
we believe the government has gone excessively too far .
i would ask him to arouse our sympathy a little more .
signing his name , Jean Chr 茅 tien , from the Prime Minister ' s office , sending out Liberal stuff asking for Liberal money and Liberal donations so they could try to form a Liberal government .
changes are also proposed to the formula which will be used to calculate the disability levels .
the Liberal government believes that we should balance spending in this sector with a plan to invest in the future of Canadian culture .
prayers
privilege
i have witnessed a transformation of the people of Guelph - Wellington in the years between 1993 and 1997 .
through its expansion and building of new facilities , including a new production hatchery , new administration offices and a new diagnostics lab , its investments have created long term jobs and will have a sustained , positive economic impact on the Kitchener area .
Mr. Speaker , national unity is a very important issue for Canada .
Beauchesne ' s sixth edition , citation 28 , states " Parliament is a court with respect to its own privileges and dignity and the privileges of its members '' .
hon. Jane Stewart
this bill will abolish the current old age security pension , the guaranteed income supplement , the tax credit for pensioners and the age benefit .
he also talked about some of the principles which guide us .
if resurrected , Bill C - 65 may result in the expropriation of private land and the prevention of industrial expansion in areas housing endangered species .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the member for Saint - Maurice and concerns the grant of $ 600,000 that was given to a hotel chain in his riding .
it has been blessed with very low international interest rates , which has played well for the government in terms of debt reduction , which again has nothing to do with the government itself .
the FAMILY
as the official opposition it is our duty to hold the government accountable for effects of its legislation which it may wish to ignore , or which it may wish the public to ignore because those effects are negative .
this is just the beginning .
hon. John Manley :
BRITISH COLUMBIA
i say welcome to the new millennium .
Mr. Steve Mahoney :
the Speaker :
by decreasing the deficit and the debt we will be able to give them more value for their tax dollars .
madam Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the member for Etobicoke - Lakeshore .
Mr. Speaker , I want to inform the member if he has not been reading the press in the last few days , Human Resources Development Canada announced a post TAGS review .
when she was appointed and gave her first speech to the bar association this summer it was tough talk all the way .
will he remove them ?
today I am going to try to tighten it up just a little bit more so that we get in both the question and the answer in 35 seconds and I know that we are all going to co - operate .
( the House adjourned at 6.17 p.m. )
we have reached this level of excellence largely thanks to the values of equality and diversity which we hold dear .
i believe it is fiscally immoral to continue to ask the younger generation to pay for a higher proportion of the debt which they were not responsible for accumulating .
we need to share information about issues of importance to Canadians in order that we can have fruitful and informed discussions on those very issues .
foreign Affairs
since even Quebec federalists are calling the Calgary declaration an empty shell , how can the Prime Minister see it as a huge step forward on which we can pin all our hopes ?
Mr. Jason Kenney
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , when we pass laws that destroy the peace of mind of citizens , what are we doing ?
Canadians have come to the full realization that we are too small a nation to simply to trade with each other .
more unfortunate in the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition was that he suggested transfers of responsibilities should be done by statutes .
this will provide individuals , schools , libraries , small and large businesses , rural and Aboriginal communities , public institutions , and all levels of government with new opportunities for learning , interacting , transacting business and developing their social and economic potential .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
a much more modest set of changes along these lines would be acceptable .
i do not even know if it should be called Reform .
what we know is that the first retirees , the first beneficiaries of the Canada pension plan , will have received $ 11 in benefits for every dollar in premiums that they paid into the plan .
no political party can tolerate this and certainly the voters in Canada cannot expect to tolerate this for a minute , if this kind of thing did indeed happen .
it is the most important bill I am introducing today .
as I said earlier , that right is clearly stated in the Education Act and in section 41 of the Quebec charter of rights , which is a quasi - constitutional provision .
then , the government will give Quebec the right to decide its own future in accordance with the democratic rules which are part of the common heritage of the peoples of Canada and Quebec .
i ask the justice minister what she plans to do to protect women who have been victimized , women who have been so savagely terrorized .
as is the case with most quick fix privatization proposals , it sounds too good and easy to be true , and it probably is '' .
Mr. Speaker , regarding the debate during the 1988 election campaign , that was the only campaign since 1963 in which I did not run .
for the first time he understands the real political truths in this country .
liberal PARTY OF CANADA
madam Speaker , first I would like to congratulate my colleague on his maiden speech .
i find interesting some of the statements the member for Markham made .
our hearts shed bitter tears .
according to the survey , in every province except Quebec , more Canadians thought Neil Armstrong was the first Canadian in space rather than Marc Garneau .
introduction and first reading
one cannot talk through one ' s hat here .
in fact , some of the new technology we have helps us to do our job in an excellent way .
bill C - 209 .
the matter is a complicated one , but it concerns a very basic right .
there is information that suggests that the Prime Minister did not know and then there are other suggestions that he did .
it is to strengthen and unite this country by joining in the common purpose of keeping Canada one of the best places in the world in which to live .
i also believe that investing $ 32 million in community based crime prevention programs is a big step in the right direction .
Mr. Speaker , this bill is directed toward the ethical and health components of new technology .
the Speaker :
for example , the provinces will lose a fairly large source of future tax revenue because the present old age security is taxable and the new seniors benefit is not taxable by the provinces .
it is a dairy farm region .
now the Liberals are looking after their friends , giving $ 29 million in government contracts to the firm that ran their last two federal election campaigns .
this bill is needed as a deterrent to those considering these types of actions .
one of the most fundamental initiatives he undertook was to push us toward understanding the inherent right to self - government that aboriginal people have .
the gap between the rich and the poor would widen as we privatized the Canada pension plan .
this must change , not merely because it may be politically advantageous but because it is right , because it is fair and because it is what real justice is all about .
the throne speech was a big disappointment to me .
some hon. members :
i am appalled at the tactics being used here .
under the current policies it would have cost my family $ 8,000 to immigrate to this great country and he is talking about what a great society it is and how great and wonderful it is .
during the course of this Parliament we pledge to do more to meet the needs of low income families with children .
points OF ORDER
the bottom line of our analysis is that Bill C - 4 fails to improve the market sensitivity of the Canadian Wheat Board and fails to substantially improve the marketing options open to producers .
yet we do not know when the Foundation will be truly operational , nor what it has planned for the world of research .
i am sure I speak on behalf of all of my new colleagues when I say that his words and actions have instilled a confidence in all of us based on the characters of those who are chairing this House .
the debate spoke to the renewed confidence that Canadians have in their government .
they were pleased that we had won the war against the deficit , that the unemployment rate had dropped by over 2 percent and that 974,000 jobs were created by September 1997 .
so we go to Meech Lake and we are not at united Canada .
we see that the actions of the CRTC and its cultural police conflict with the stated goals of this government to facilitate innovation and entrepreneurship .
i believe sincerely that Prime Minister Laurier was correct that the 20 th century does belong to Canada .
i would like , if I may , to begin by speaking to my constituents in the riding of Rosemont .
they must be dealt with as they arise .
on his way to today ' s Atlantic Vision Conference the Minister of Industry had the arrogance and the audacity to tell Atlantic Canadians not to expect a fair hearing from this government because they made a " mistake " when they fired Liberals in the last election .
the interests of Quebeckers go beyond the security of the money they set aside for their retirement .
they pray that the minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing will immediately suspend negotiations on social housing with the province of Ontario and resume negotiations only if the minister proceeds under publicly declared principles established with the input of the co - operative housing stakeholders .
while I disagree with much of what he said , I believe that he is a constructive force for federalism in this country and I commend him on that .
health care is an example .
some western grain producers and producer groups have been asking for more flexibility in the marketing of wheat and barley .
having more resources would allow members time to conduct a more thorough study of the issues that come before them .
i am confident ordinary Canadians would recognize that aspects of what the former justice minister reported in this House were incorrect and misleading and that the finding of Charles Dubin concerning the conduct of Ted Thompson is at best deficient and at worst a deliberate whitewash as he had access to all the damning information contained in the documents filed in the supreme court , and that the Canadian Judicial Council ' s examination of the conduct of Chief Justice Isaac is also inadequate and deficient .
Mr. Speaker , of course the Reform Party believes that we need to do whatever we can to help citizens across the country .
the ministers of all provinces , including Quebec , agreed on the following measures .
but this one was different .
Mr. Chuck Cadman
in fact many employees of the Canadian Wheat Board are constituents of mine who live in the riding of Charleswood - Assiniboine .
it is my belief that this culture will continue so long as there are people - sovereignists or federalists - wanting to keep it flowering .
that is what integrity prescribes .
i implore the government to listen to what is being said in the House .
i am not saying this is the last word in that analysis but I want to illustrate how these tests might apply to the amendment that the committee will be studying .
with respect to the question of advisers , the advisers were retained in accordance with normal Treasury Board guidelines .
it was refused categorically at that stage .
first , let me congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on assuming your position in the chair today .
there is also the transitional job creation fund , $ 95 million of which has been invested in job creation in Quebec .
at long last there is a glow of optimism within industry .
i certainly thank the constituents of Medicine Hat for placing their trust with me once again .
my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
this is also true of small businesses like , for instance , a business incubator on the South Shore .
every family should have a smoke detector , a home fire escape plan , conduct fire drills and learn to react quickly and decisively .
and that is precisely what I mean , the earliest possible moment .
let me make it perfectly clear that members of the government are determined that the Canada pension plan will not be put at risk again .
here is an opportunity which was provided to us by the Bloc .
Mr. David Pratt ( Nepean - Carleton , Lib . ) :
i am struck as a new member by the differences and the similarities .
i hope not because I have the greatest respect for the time limits put on me .
Mr. Speaker , I am privileged to table in the House a private member ' s bill which will amend the Criminal Code to provide for the arrest of those in breach of condition of parole or statutory or temporary release .
we hear calls to spend more from the left .
this was the route used by the settlers who came from Europe to clear the land and develop their farms .
the new west is built on the principle of freedom of enterprise , fiscal responsibility , compassion for the young , the old , the sick and the poor , equality of citizens and provinces and democracy that reflects the common sense of the common people .
Canadians with disabilities want the opportunity to participate fully in the economic and social life of this country .
but when inevitably the number of new investors declined , the whole scheme fell apart and Ponzi ended up in jail .
i want them to stand and say " We told the RCMP to hold off until after the election " because it would be an embarrassment .
following the hon. member , Mr. Speaker , he could just leave if he wanted to .
members of the official opposition keep talking about shell games .
the Canada pension plan is a pay as you go plan .
where do we get increases when there are supposed inefficiencies from this structure ?
adjournment PROCEEDINGS
certainly the difference that I heard from the throne speech has been echoed by my colleagues who stood with pride to speak about a document that was about confidence , vision and hope .
the Bloc leader is in fact encouraging ethnic grouping .
they gave us Beaudoin - Dobbie , Beaudoin - Edwards , the Spicer Commission report , and the Charlottetown accord , which was put to a referendum and defeated .
Mr. Alex Shepherd :
the hon. member was on the same committee .
hon. Paul Martin
i would ask the unanimous consent of the House for the hon. member to table this sheet of paper .
hear , hear .
he has changed his hair , he has changed his teeth and he has changed his voice .
" i am shocked - This is just terrible .
it will have cut $ 42 billion from social programs , health care , education and social assistance , thus forcing the closure of hospitals , driving thousands of workers denied unemployment insurance toward welfare and causing massive cuts in schools .
Mr. Peter MacKay
i wish to advise the House , and in particular the Hon. St 茅 phane Dion , Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs -
my question is for the Minister of Health .
in its electoral platform , the Bloc proposed that the employment insurance fund surplus be used to lower employment insurance premiums by at least 35 芦 and to re - invest $ 2.5 billion in improving assistance to the unemployed , including the seasonally unemployed .
there is an enormous amount of work that goes on in committees when members put aside some of their partisanship and focus on how to build an excellent health care system , on how to build a good research and development program and how to deal with issues of equity when you are looking at issues of debt reduction .
i conducted three of these meetings in my riding .
libel lawyers across the country are calling this payout immense , astonishing and stunning .
there are a lot of us here who live in that province .
the provinces pay interest on these loans at the rate of long - term federal government bonds , as set at the time they were issued .
we have seen the success firsthand of the internship programs undertaken by the private sector .
Mr. Speaker , I wish to congratulate you on your new responsibilities .
special JOINT COMMITTEE
why can it not see that there is a different solution .
i dedicate my maiden speech in the House of Commons in this Parliament to her .
the New Zealand government ran out of international currencies within a few days of the Labour Party taking office .
it is indeed generous and has been aware of the solitude the member spoke about .
the nice part about being in the Chair is that you do not always see everything .
when alluding to the issue of national unity in English he advocated the hard line , because he was addressing English Canadians , of course , but he used a much more conciliatory tone in French .
funds not required immediately to pay benefits are invested in non - marketable provincial government securities .
we reinvested in health care .
education matters more than ever today .
Canadians are fed up with negativism .
i can assure the House that our customs people are professional , committed and do an excellent job of protecting our borders .
i have found that the most innovative solutions come from young people .
on the contrary , we are delighted with the pension reform .
canada is the land of opportunity and the government has committed itself to making the vision of tomorrow a reality for Canadian youth .
people care for each other in many ways , and they give their time and their support to their community .
and what about another attempt at interference , the integration of a federal drug plan ?
customs
the deception is that somehow our financial problems have been fixed although we have a $ 50 billion interest payment .
Thursday , October 2 , 1997
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
if Quebec is allowed freedom of expression , then Canada must also have the freedom to make up its mind .

RCMP INVESTIGATIONS

they do not fulfil their campaign promises .
we actually have to realize that our ultimate success is a net cost .
there has to be a restructuring of the plan .
we all know how close she is to her family and her husband .
i begin by thanking the residents of Scarborough Centre for once again entrusting me with their vote and their confidence .
several countries have already made this transition and we believe Canada can do so as well .
in our minds the matter involves - and I see that the Privy Council agreed - a bilateral amendment .
surely after nearly two weeks of inquiries the government should know the truth .
let us ensure that Canadians have a say in this .
in my riding , none of my opponents obtained 15 % of the votes .
and anyway , a number of them had already carried out a similar exercise .
our interest rates are substantially lower than those in the United States .
the hon. member opposite says he could not get a hearing before that committee .
maybe he should read that .
in recent years , as hon. members may know , a number of social , economic and demographic trends have developed , such as declining birth rates , increased life expectancy and lower than anticipated growth in productivity and wages , which , if unaddressed , could challenge the sustainability of Canada ' s public pension system .
Mr. Louis Plamondon ( Richelieu , BQ ) :
this is the fundamental issue that must be understood .
i remember being in the House a few years ago when the Conservatives brought in five or six increases to the Canada pension plan .
we all go through the same list .
there is the answer .
however , in the throne speech there is only dry bones , administrative tinkering to deal with the problems of these programs .
madam Speaker , I will be brief .
some hon. members :
it involves every aspect of the business , rail operators , elevator operators , port operators , pilotage organizations , pool operators and the primary producers , the farmers .
the member is to address the Speaker and not the minister directly .
environment
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Industry .
his counsel remained available to several committees and his testimony was given to a special committee established following the famous ringing of the bells , which remained lively and cogent in his critique of the House of Commons .
you cannot visit Oxford without being struck by the beauty of its farmland and the generous hospitality of its citizens .
there is a new kid on the block that is making its presence felt in a big way .
canada ' s current government has seen fit to take charge of this issue and to move us forward in a way that most industrialized nations have not yet be able to do .
i hope that each of those members will say that they did not look at it from the point of view of employment .
why ?
one colleagues has just said that they are here to oppose .
as noted earlier , one currently in receipt of a retirement pension under the CPP will not see that pension change .
there is a message in that of dissatisfaction .
however there was a common issue in each and every household , the issue of Canadian unity and how our country today is being torn apart .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel
* * *
people from the Fredericton area will always remember Chester MacRae for his dry wit .
there is a lot of chatter about helicopters , Mr. Minister , concerning what is been taking so long to conform to the contract .
if we provide a pension plan based solely on the RRSP system there will be a much greater demand on the tax system than what we see right now .
we can see that potential entrepreneurs in this country are hit with a triple whammy .
if that is not consultation , what is ?
( 13 ) to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights
as is customary in making the first speech of a Parliament , I want to begin by paying tribute to my riding and my constituents .
we are not here to undermine what is being done elsewhere , quite the contrary , but we are aware that , while the bill affects Quebec to some extent , it does so in an indirect way .
the Liberals go around preening and busting their britches over their balancing the budget by next year .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
seventh , they recommended that any future enhancements or enrichments of the CPP program must be fully funded .
a single environmental assessment process based on nationally agreed upon standards is crucial .
edited HANSARD * NUMBER 11
i believe that my constituents in the wonderful riding of Thornhill expect all of us to do what we can to solve the problems that we face in a positive and constructive way .
it is not a government - opposition issue but is a member issue that should be addressed by the board .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te
we live in a democratic system where people have a right to make donations to the candidate and the party of their choice .
and worse still - my final point - the duration of employment insurance benefits has been shortened .
second , I have nothing against seniors having fun .
it is a priority for members of the official opposition , members of other opposition parties and members of government .
she has been a friendly and devoted member of this House .
in 25 years some things do not change .
i am sure this book is in the Privy Council library .
( 1 ) Nothing in any such Law shall prejudicially affect any Right or Privilege with respect to Denominational Schools which any Class of Persons have by Law in the Province at the Union ;
whether a bill is introduced in one House or the other , they are of course debated in both Houses .
Mr. Speaker , 51 of 52 of my colleagues in the last Parliament gave up their pensions as a sign of sacrifice , as have many provincial legislators engaged in the same deficit cutting exercise .
i believe we will be judged in not too many years on the measure of fairness we show now .
government raises the cost of supplies and products without consultation , thereby affecting sales .
Stan Waters made Canadian history when he was elected by the biggest majority of Canadians in any election .
the third option would be change the board and have influence from the primary producers , and this is what Bill C - 4 does .
madam Speaker , this past weekend I attended an economic forum in the riding of Matap 茅 dia - Matane .
increased tuition costs have made it even more difficult for students of the north who must already pay relocation costs to continue their education in university .
Mr. Speaker , the French President , Jacques Chirac , said and I quote " France will accompany Quebec , whatever route it chooses to follow . "
perhaps the minister could think for a moment .
in one sense I am speaking on the broader issue of democracy , of politics and of the needs of people in society to support and participate in our parliamentary democracy , not just those who have economic power and sway .
since we have taken office over a million jobs have been created in the private sector .
would I support the elimination of all the so - called tax expenditures ?
Mr. Deepak Obhrai
while public service executives are getting significant bonuses , many clerks , secretaries and other employees are still not being paid the retroactive payments owed to them .
during the course of our trip to Budapest , I met with a group of family friends .
one of the most crucial investments we can make for our children is through the protection of the natural environment .
political CONTRIBUTIONS
what a discovery .
as I have alluded to , the cost of this fund will not be shared equally among the generations .
Mr. Speaker , I am surprised the hon. member opposite just figured out that a lot of people will soon be turning 50 .
one generation receives a return over 20 times greater than another generation , and we have a difficult situation because of that .
employment
it is almost as if they had both hands in the till themselves .
to paraphrase the prime minister ' s recent comments in the House , it is high time that this government put up or shut up on this issue .

when they get the money in their hands they usually spend it and the money is gone .
routine PROCEEDINGS
i believe maritimers , who also are faced with high unemployment and poverty , must be wondering what the federal government is waiting for to enter into partnerships with other governments , with the provinces .
it got worse over time .
hon. Herb Gray
Ms. Marlene Catterall :
may I express the thanks of millions of Canadians for the great work and dedication given to us by the Royal Canadian Legion members .
these people think we are boy scouts when do our duty with integrity .
i do salute the co - operation of the House in facilitating new members from the other parties who are able to get on with this additional time today .
it was 50:50 .
the Speech from the Throne also mentions making Canada the location of choice for global investment .
we need to do the sorts of things to make Atlantic Canada competitive in a modern day environment and in an environment of globalization .
three of the five parties in this House of Commons are not represented in the Senate at all .
Mr. Speaker , I offered just a moment ago to table a sworn affidavit from a 25 - year veteran of this minister ' s department .
the farmers have spoken , the grassroots have spoken , the people have spoken .
i stand here as a product of the 1995 referendum .
income TAX ACT
but , as you wish , I will move right along .
if that challenge does go through the whole process and to a final panel , we will use those strategies to defend the dairy industry as we did in the NAFTA panel .
Mr. Speaker , Quebecers are visibly losing faith in the Bloc Quebecois .
they comprise if they have to because we all know there is no perfect solution .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
the Speaker :
that is what this government has done .
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi ( Bramalea - Gore - Malton , Lib . ) :
the chances of the Quebec government ' s constitutional amendment satisfying these three tests would be greatly enhanced and its prospects for gaining the support in this Parliament of the official opposition would be enhanced if this constitutional amendment were to be accompanied by three things :
Mr. Richard Marceau
absolutely not .
one cannot have a special set of rules for Canada that do not apply to other countries .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the prime minister .
i am also honoured to have his ongoing support and guidance as I enter this exciting new chapter .
members should ask how much more employment is this government willing to forgo .
this passive approach will be re - evaluated at the next Canada pension plan review scheduled to begin in 1999 .
the big boys in the prime minister ' s office refused to listen to him .
the government would be directing about $ 130 billion .
statements BY MEMBERS
i have also lived in British Columbia and I can assure the member that the people of that province do not think the way she is talking today .
third , can these surpluses be increased by more responsible federal spending ?
this is so good and I am terribly sorry I do not have the time to read it .
in 1988 .
again it attacks low income families .
it is always like that .
i think that is ridiculous .
i have talked to those people .
this country as a whole is what I am worried about .
that is another concern .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , on October 9 , 1867 , three months after the proclamation of Canadian Confederation , 167 physicians from the then four provinces of Canada met in Quebec City to establish the Canadian Medical Association .
we are ready and willing to work with all interested parties to develop a long term comprehensive plan of action in partnership with aboriginal leaders and people .
Mr. Speaker , on Thursday last , the Liberal member for Laval West took offence at the attitude of the Bloc Quebecois to the appointment of Liberal judge Michel Bastarache , saying that sovereignists , and I quote , " never hesitate to reward their separatist friends '' .
business and engineering schools will need to begin to teach decision making models and algorithms that incorporate comprehensive costing principles .
we now pay 15 per cent tax on children ' s clothing , electricity , heating , and it goes on and on .
hon. Andy Scott
the Speaker :
i would submit to him that , conversely , I experienced the highest rates at a time when I had a substantial mortgage .
a national image must be created that will have such an appeal as to make any image of a separatist group unattractive '' .
Mr. Odina Desrochers
if we were to acknowledge the heroes of the deficit war over the last number of years it would not be the Minister of Finance and our Liberal colleagues across the way or our previous Conservative friends in the House of Commons .
the reforms that we have initiated and that we are pursuing will allow us not only to save money , but also to get our money ' s worth , to pay for services that Canadians really need , in a flexible and efficient manner .
* * *
this year ' s theme is future cities , a theme that offers an opportunity for people living in communities everywhere to consider the current state of their city and to explore how existing problems can be overcome and their communities made more equitable , just and sustainable .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Jack Ramsay
in the case of the recent request from the Newfoundland legislature asking the House to amend section 17 of Newfoundland ' s 1949 terms of union , the Newfoundland government has conducted two referendums and a majority of those voting voted on both occasions in favour of the proposed amendment .
CPP premiums will rise at a faster rate than originally planned .
i live in an urban centre .
i had nothing to do with the management of the firm .
we must ensure that all Canadians can benefit from this economic success .
this is a tragic decision for all Quebeckers , but the government does not care , because the Quebec culture obviously does not exist .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
this is why we committed ourselves to strengthening Canada ' s public pension system .
the wheat board works on farmers ' behalf .
i have a sense that the goals we all share will move us forward in our common quest for the betterment of Canada .
no family , no political party , no province and no country which ignores its troubled regions and troubled peoples while watching others thrive and prosper can call itself justified , decent or responsible .
Mr. Speaker will know that the Minister of Industry is a member of Parliament and all members of Parliament can avail themselves of the privilege of seeing a document that is before a committee .
this is a democratic exercise that is not only healthy and necessary but also respectful of the opinions generated by all sides in this debate .
communities receive non - perishables like fuel and construction material by sea lift , many of them only once a year .
TAMIL EELAM SOCIETY
DORA AWARDS
the government is paying down the deficit on the backs of workers , small businesses and on the backs of the unemployed , especially young unemployed Canadians .
given that he is a party in this court case , has the prime minister considered that he may have put the court in a conflict of interest position by personally appointing his old law partner to the Supreme Court of Canada ?
the members opposite claim they do not take donations from corporations when they actually do , and that is what is not right .
one , clear evidence of majority support for the Quebec constitutional amendment through the results of a province wide referendum .
all projects have been approved based on merit .
currently really the only legislators here are those in cabinet .
as the deputy critic for national unity my role is to ensure that the grassroots at the municipal level are listened to and that they have a pivotal role to play in the future of Canada .
Mr. Art Hanger ( Calgary Northeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , for the minister ' s information , the Bloc Quebecois still holds the majority of seats in Quebec .
nor does anyone expect any constitutional amendments .
everyone remembers Trudeau , one hand on the wheel - he was a great cavalier driver - and the other hand out the window giving the finger to Alberta and other places .
that is one of the lessons .
during the last election I made up a little card .
a new investment policy therefore was necessary to improve the way CPP funds are invested and to secure the best possible return for plan members .
it is time for the government to start to consider those things , and we want to talk to the Canadian public about it .
i look forward to help from the member in convincing the ministers of health and finance that we need to start increasing transfer payments .
the Minister of Finance can boast about our public finances being in order .
i thank the people of Beaus 茅 jour for paying off the deficit and all the other unemployed , sick and students of the country who paid the deficit .
Ms. Bev Desjarlais
hon. Lloyd Axworthy
i think this is of utmost importance .

Mr. Fraser was twice a candidate for the House of Commons : once on the west coast in Esquimalt - Saanich and once on the east coast in Pictou .

the youth unemployment rate in August was 16.7 percent , almost double the national rate of 9 percent .
i am aware that the question would be put at 2.15 this afternoon .
Mr. Greg Thompson :
we will continue to do that with businesses , voluntary groups and unions , with aboriginal groups and communities .
during the public consultation forums one of my constituents , Mr. Phil Connell , appeared before the panel .
in other words , is it just a narrowly focused vote buying tactic ?
consequently , we call upon Parliament to initiate a special independent inquiry with a mandate to cast light on the events surrounding the decision of December 23 , 1991 , and on the subsequent use of that tax loophole by other rich Canadian taxpayers '' .
this time we are talking about a major piece of legislation .
our government acting in co - operation with our provincial partners took the lead to restore financial footing of the plan .
the Speaker :
there are a number of other initiatives that I believe would spur employment in this country .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
Ms. Alexa McDonough
now the only thing that matters to the government is to create an image , an illusion .
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau , BQ ) :
Mr. Paul Szabo
i was pleased to hear in the speech from the throne that " Stimulating job creation and economic growth has been , remains and will continue to be a major objective of the Government of Canada . "
as it stands now only the few in cabinet have any real opportunity for input .
Mr. Grant Hill
and by renumbering subsection ( d ) of section ( 3 ) of Standing Order 108 as subsection ( e ) ;
i hope the committee will look very carefully at this whole matter of what kind of accountability there should be .
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Governor General read a speech from the Throne that contained a number of particularly moving , even lyrical , passages on Canada in the 21 st century .
we on this side of the House , plus two or three on the other side , do not believe that the role of government should be that of the 19 th century laissez - faire state waiting to deal with emergencies .
does he condemn SchoolNet ?
to serve the public is perhaps a calling , definitely a right , and truly a responsibility we all have .
i think this is an important point .
in each case , the information is made public and everything can be checked .
as my constituents know very well , the last four years were not easy in our thrust to put the country in a secure financial position for the future .
i hear people in the Reform Party stand up and say no more government programs , no more government assistance , no more need for it across this country .
this is how we turn values into action .
no , certainly not .
i think it would be advisable for my hon. colleagues to wait for an investigation to be completed , for charges to be laid and for guilt to be established before taking general information -
i can see the Bloc ' s histrionics have started to spread to the Reform Party .
great Britain has already partially privatized its public pension system and is considering a more ambitious reform .
the letter was simply to affirm that we are not looking for a special deal , we simply want transparency and a fair deal .
and it is still a con job .
i thank also the 6,000 volunteers that took part in my community and the surrounding area to put on the best ever Canada games .
Mr. David Chatters
Mr. John Bryden
the role of government is to provide a level of social order and progress that we cannot individually provide for ourselves .
does the minister recognize that he must take action to restore at least some trust , a necessary ingredient in successful collective bargaining ?
there is an additional reason for us to do this expeditiously .
he was the Hon. Walter Dinsdale .
Monday , October 6 , 1997
would Bloc members rather have ten contributions from members of the board than one from the corporation ?
he is a man whose family comes first .
the year ' s basic exemption , which is now $ 3,500 , will be frozen at $ 3,500 .
in terms of trade barriers within Canada , the Minister of Industry has worked very hard with the provinces and the provinces have worked very hard among themselves to come close to an agreement .
it is time to show that we are truly interested in providing jobs for the unemployed , feeding the hungry , clothing the naked , sheltering the homeless , caring for the sick , educating our youth , embracing our fellow human beings and allowing for growth , development and self - determination .
order , please .
the people of Thornhill , especially the Jewish community , believe that Canada must be vigilant in prosecuting war criminals .
that is the difference .
was that a question , Mr. Speaker ?
wherever we go everyone says it is the biggest trade mission they have ever received .
( 12 ) to the Standing Committee on Industry
there is also the bilateral formula and the unanimity rule , which applies to the position of lieutenant governor , the Queen ' s representative , and to the redrawing of some boundaries , among other things .
satisfied with the current state of the country and unable to offer Canadians a national vision with clear objectives for the country as a whole , the Chr 茅 tien government has certainly set out its intentions , but without structure or time frame .
hon. David M Collenette
it is neither equitable nor cheaper .
the purpose of this bill is to raise awareness of Canadians to the choices that the appointees of the Liberals are making .
the answer lies with the RCMP .
these success stories are remarkable , particularly when we think of the unique challenges we face in Canada .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
furthermore , the right to religious instruction is still guaranteed under section 41 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms , a document that has quasi - constitutional status according to the Supreme Court of Canada .
introduction and first reading
even Diefenbaker had a vision of the north .
there is the Department of Finance paper entitled " Explaining the Jobless Recovery " by Cozier and Mang which was produced within the economic studies and policy analysis division .
* * *
we as a nation have a decision to make .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Solicitor General .
was it necessary for this government to spend $ 50 million to build ski chalets in Mont Tremblant or $ 70,000 to build an ice cream parlour ?
Quebeckers are fully aware of the fact that no economic union is possible without a social union to give it harmony , structure and strength .
bill C - 239 .
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to introduce this bill .
the Liberal government with the help of all Canadians turned the country ' s financial books around .
a point of order , the hon. member for West Nova .
if I may digress a little , I wish to inform the House that I am an immigrant .
it is a fundamental privilege for each member to be able to act as the spokesperson for his community and to be able to introduce private members ' bills .
although Bill C - 4 resembles very closely Bill C - 72 , there are a few changes that differentiate it from its predecessor .
therefore , I move :
i got involved in federal politics because I believe that the federal government has a unique responsibility to bring together and mobilize every part of this country , that is to say every generation , every region and every citizen of this country , to respond to the question the Bloc Quebecois is obsessively asking with ambitious plans , mainly by ensuring that each and every one of us can achieve our full potential within the Canadian democracy while making an important contribution to the international community .
this is how this government will continue to work to keep our country together .
does that sound like a broken record ?
all Canadians have a stake in meeting this challenge successfully .
order .
i will use my brief 10 - minute speech to describe the vision that haunts me when I put the terms " transparency " and " Liberal Party of Canada " together .
this past June was cause for national mourning when Stanley Knowles passed away .
i support unconditionally the government ' s commitment to maintain a comprehensive public health care system that provides universal access to high quality care for all Canadians .
( official Version )
questions come to mind .
thanks to the efforts and talents of local vintners , Niagara wines are more popular than ever and are expanding into the ever growing international market .
at the same time they went beyond and added $ 50 million over the next three years , which the member also pointed out .
Mr. Speaker , let me congratulate you on your appointment to your new job .
that amendment is further amended by a subamendment in the name of the hon. member for Halifax West .
however I must point out that Quebec administers a plan which parallels the Canada pension plan , that is , the Quebec pension plan .
it is an area of Canada that needs economic development .
so that the hon. finance minister cannot continue to misquote the Reform position , let us tell people today that all of those people who have paid into the CPP will be paid out in a credit system whereby they will get a prorated pension plan for the years of contribution .
in addition to funds for health and education , we will continue our attack on unemployment in general and youth unemployment in particular .
i never said we would do so , and we never determined what form this would take .
i will become a cultural worker again when the time comes for me to leave here .
if we consider that the Canada pension plan premiums are contributed by those who are working , that is a defined set of people .
but they will be out there and Canadians will be in a period of uncertainty on health care until the national government offers real leadership , not denial .
Mr. Bob Mills
hon. Lyle Vanclief
i would remind him of that rule .
as we are now going to commence voting , I would remind the honourable members to print the first and last names of their candidate on the ballot paper .
there is a marked difference here .
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Ralph Campbell , a constituent in my riding , for his work as a volunteer with Canadian Executive Services Organization .
the Speaker :
since 1990 , this road of renewed federalism has seemed to be a dead end .
i have some concerns about the fact that we did not hear about it until five days after the election was over .
it is virtually identical .
Mr. Speaker , my congratulations on your re - election , Sir .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :

it is a pyramid scheme .
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan
we will focus aboriginal business investment programs on more long term strategic investment opportunities for all aboriginal peoples .
working together in partnership with all levels of government is the only effective way to ensure the delivery of services to people within a sound economic framework .
it condemns the 27 years of spending by the federal government in the past .

then we moved to Bill C - 2 and we were hardly into the second or third hour and the government moved closure .
i had the opportunity to travel to that part of the world a year and a half ago with Canada ' s foreign affairs committee , which was studying the Arctic Council in that area .
imagine for a moment , and I ask the Leader of the Opposition to picture this , that the American Congress decided , without consulting one quarter of the American states - California , Florida , New York - to change the American Constitution .
its systems are exported to 29 countries around the world , and in 1996 exports accounted for 68 % of its total sales .
the people of Cariboo - Chilcotin voted for Reform during the last election because , like many Canadians , they wanted three things .
i want to reiterate , on behalf of all Bloc members , our attachment to that founding minority , the English community , whose rights will be maintained in the future .
far from being fixed and immovable , our federation is one that keeps evolving .
for our children it is a legacy in which I would like to put a serious dent , of course always keeping in mind Liberal values and social responsibilities .
Mr. Speaker , I will repeat that there is simply no RCMP investigation , as mentioned in the letter Mr. Roy ' s lawyers sent on this issue .
not a two tier system .
the only assistance these young people will likely need is access to information which will help them make wise decisions in their education and career choices .
i must say that one of the Quebec government ' s priorities is indeed to protect the environment .
could she make sure the former minister is not part of what is going on to solve the problem she has with these Vietnamese deportees who are in Canada ?
voters preferred our more responsible approach and saw through the Reform Party ' s irresponsible tax cut promise before the budget was balanced .
when he retired in 1979 this House was different than it is today .
because we are following the lessons of Mr. L 茅 vesque , who thought that , by respect for the people and to better serve the people , big businesses , banks and trust companies should not finance political parties .
who could deny the disability benefits that are applicable ?
the answers that I am giving reflect the knowledge of facts such as they are .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
the Speaker
the petitioners draw the attention of the House to the fact that Canadian consumers are deeply affected by the price hikes in gasoline .
hon. Jean J . Charest :
it will create more inequity in the country once again .
we must continue to relentlessly challenge not only our own standards but those of the international community .
in my opinion , the government has a duty to ease job creation by promoting the kind of economic environment we need and by nurturing partnerships with the private and non - profit sectors .
i can guarantee to this House that Canada was not in complicity with any act of assassination or criminal attempt .
Mr. Speaker , I have been struck by exactly what my hon. colleague from Winnipeg has been talking about .
yesterday in the House the Minister of National Revenue challenged me during question period at page 330 of Hansard to produce in the House facts and table them here regarding the question I asked both yesterday and today .
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
this legislation would establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board .
instead what it did was it helped to create a $ 600 billion debt and stagnant unemployment today .
as a career educator and seasoned parliamentarian he earned our trust through an election process I particularly appreciated not only as a newcomer in this House , but also as a former member of the Quebec National Assembly .
second , what is the optimal level of government ?
that is not just offering employment opportunities , it is also offering training opportunities to provide youth with a better lifestyle down the road .
they have made themselves heard on issues like national unity , technology and the new economy .
the board is backlogged and is unable to hear cases expeditiously .
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate you on your appointment .
the traditional Liberal , NDP and Tory approaches of throwing additional billions at problems is no longer a realistic solution , even though we see the government continuing to attempt to do that .
the rights of these people were affected even after that constitutional amendment .
we do have younger Canadians .
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
the Liberals also promised to close loopholes in campaign finance laws .
madam Speaker , I listened with some interest to the comments made by the hon. member .
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate you on your appointment and all other members who have been appointed to similar positions .
this has happened most recently in Vancouver .
we must remember that the money we receive is our own money .
the bill speaks to that and the member for Saint John denies it .
Mr. Speaker , we have a privately funded plan that already exists in our country .
i always use a litmus test .
this was all done without the knowledge of defence counsel .
[ editor ' s Note :
therefore with a tiny tweak in terms of a tax incentive which would have very minimal cost to the treasury , we could actually accomplish some great things and get a lot more Canadians back to work .
today we in the Miramichi have heard of the resignation of our premier .
as I said earlier we can never afford to mortgage the future of our country .
Mr. Speaker , they changed it all right .
perhaps an order paper question would be in order .
the minister answered his second question by saying that the proposed amendment is a good thing in his judgment because it acknowledges the secularization of the Quebec school system while still guaranteeing rights to religious instruction , and because it permitted the Quebec educational system to be based on language rather than religion and that the proposed system , in his judgment , was fair to both language groups .
reformers are calling for a super RRSP plan where billions of dollars will be spent to subsidize the rich as they fatten their bankbooks with a very healthy pension plan .
all of us know that in time if we stay with the plan we have we will be going back for more contributions , more money , more tax grabs .
at the same time we see obstacles being placed in the way by the components within the justice system that have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo in an industry that spends $ 10 billion a year on youth and adult crimes .
how do we encourage these domestic and foreign workers to choose Canada ?
Mr. Peter Adams
Mr. Daniel Turp
not only does it deal with farmers , but it is now dealing with value added product which is helping the agriculture industry .

there are several such headlines because it is seen as quite a creative initiative .
during the election campaign the Liberals had to back down on health care because the health care system in this country is broken .
for example , the government would continue to provide financial backing for initial payments , borrowing , and for such programs as the credit grain sales program .
is this another of those elusive promises , like the 150,000 day care spaces , or will the federal government actually make a commitment this time ?
the Liberal government has failed to ensure that Canadians are secure in their homes and on the streets of their communities .
the people in charge of setting up the system are poised to ask a further $ 150 million to do so , four years later .
this is not irresponsible spending .
does this matter arise from question period ?
it is now possible to think about reinvesting in social programs .
by working with members across , with Canadians , with the private sector and with all levels of government , we are beginning to deal with the issue .
it is important to let the investigation proceed in the normal and effective fashion the RCMP will be undertaking .
alternatively , one wonders whether the investigation was postponed until after June 2 to avoid any embarrassment to the Liberal Party of Canada during the election campaign .
Quebec ' s only option is to vote yes in the next referendum , it is to become sovereign .
Mr. Speaker , let me to correct the facts .
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I would like to speak on and on .
i will not take orders from this House before I am done with my speech .
my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
they did not want to vote for it , they did not want to discuss it .
she is in Boston in a patronage position at the embassy .
over the last few days I have listened intently to the various speakers and to the questions and comments that have been put in the House of Commons .
let us remember that democracy is a precious thing but it is merely a means and not an end .
the innovation foundation announced in the last Parliament , this throne speech and the prime minister ' s announcement of scholarships as a millennium project illustrates dramatically that as Canadians we have embraced our knowledge based future .
points OF ORDER
it is really sad for the producers who have to deal with a federal government which is so adamant on preventing change when it concerns the interests of farmers across western Canada .

Mr. Speaker , to the hon. member opposite , I would not presuppose and begin to answer for the finance minister .
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 34 , I am pleased to table , in both official languages , the report of the parliamentary delegation that travelled to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam , and to Kaohsiung and Taipei , Taiwan , from March 29 to April 8 , 1997 .
this is the interpretation this Chair has taken from the Speaker .
we want Canadians to pay politicians .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew :
we have seen the work done in Calgary by the premiers and the territorial leaders .
the strength of the system in Quebec is at stake - we already have a bill on second reading to that effect in Quebec - and for Quebec and Canada this is about closing the generation gap .
their support underscores their belief in the government management and the importance of an open democracy , and I will certainly not discuss this today .
the auditor general states that in one three - month period , 15,000 people went to three or more pharmacies , 1,600 obtained more than 15 drugs and over 700 people had 50 prescriptions in one three - month period .
he spoke as well about the relatively low retirement income of Canadian women and their much higher rate of poverty in retirement .
we have to reach across those perhaps slanted views .
the throne speech also directed necessary resources toward the problem of youth unemployment .
when we took over , our country was going bankrupt .
bill 109 will create linguistic school boards across Quebec , thus bringing the number of school boards from 158 to 70 , and making the Quebec education system more coherent .

Mr. Speaker , the facts speak for themselves .
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member .
from the democratic point of view that is a very important point , something we are not afraid of .
bill C - 206 .
that did not come about strictly by accident .
it is not difficult to see the reasons why we would propose such a motion in the House .
it is even more pronounced now that three parties in the House have no representation in the other place .
he tells us not to look back to the past , but ahead to the future .
the solicitor general has said that CSIS only operates on court ordered warrants and points to the recent federal court ruling as proof of a rigorous method .

the CPP has become a key component of our national pension system .
by not indexing tax tables among other things , they took $ 23 billion out of taxpayers ' pockets , while talking about reducing taxes .
that ' s not true , Diane .
in relation to crime prevention , we are in fact in the process of developing a new crime prevention strategy with partners as it relates to victims .
we will achieve that long before its target .
the pay as you go system made sense given these circumstances .
in my former role as host of Doctor On Call on WTN , I was shocked at the disparity of health care across the country .
i agree that I have seen some information which tends to indicate that final offer selection arbitration tends to favour labour slightly .
the government needs to speak very clearly on the issue and guarantee it will not happen .
at the very least , Ron thought the Canadian government should issue a travel advisory so that other Canadians would not wander into the situation , but foreign affairs refused to do it .
with the help of the former minister of supply and services , I was able to leave my mark in a modest way by securing for Canadians the right to refuse ad - mail delivery by Canada Post .
i believe , as the hon. member will find out , that therein lies the constitutional problem and that , no matter what you offer , it will be too little , too late .
Mr. Speaker , my question for the hon. member for Guelph - Wellington has to do with the throne speech and what is lacking in it , which is that there is absolutely no reference whatsoever to veterans or the merchant navy veterans .
we do not have a quorum .
Mr. Speaker , I rest my case and I ask you to consider the matter and to consider it urgently because obviously if you were to intervene you would have to do it when the motion was about to be moved .
the outlook is not encouraging given the CPP hikes proposed by the government without corresponding cuts in EI premiums .
Beauchesne ' s reference No. 877 on page 241 states that " no act done at any committee should be divulged before it has been presented to the House '' .
at the very beginning , no one knew anything .
such a window is also necessary because any Canadian exporter of wheat or barley , whether on the prairies or elsewhere , requires a Canadian Wheat Board export permit .
perhaps the Reform Party wants some type of electoral reform so that election results do not really count , so that the expressed will of Canadians during a federal election is not what really matters .
it is money that belongs to Canadians and they ought to be able to keep it .
how can he keep saying we are all okay when in fact they have been responsible for adding yet another 20 percent , another $ 100 billion , to the debt during their previous term ?
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
Macdonald , the guiding light , was gone .
when we took office , 50 % of government contracts were sole sourced .
in other words , growth - promoting economic policies can in many instances be implemented independently of the fiscal position of the government .
Mr. Speaker , this summer when the Liberals were out making election promises they swore that any budget surplus would be split 50:50 , half would go to new Liberal spending programs naturally , and the other half would actually go back into taxpayers ' pockets or to debt retirement .
our citizens have the qualities that are needed to succeed in the 21 st century :

the Government will take a very broad and encompassing approach to promoting and strengthening our unity .
we need to focus on child hunger .
second , it must stop using the unemployment insurance fund surplus .
does the hon. member feel that reducing taxes for students so that they can pay for their schooling , that reducing taxes for the physically disabled so that they are given a level playing field , that helping poor families with children is not the kind of thing the government should do ?
we actually did not think this was going to happen until we occupied the other side of the House .
i am sure you will do a good job .
there is so much consensus that we find New Democrats in Saskatchewan , Liberals in the Atlantic provinces , the Parti qu 茅 b 猫 cois in Quebec City and even , who would have thought , the federal Liberal Party of Canada have come around to the idea that we have to actually balance our books .

i would like to ask the member , very briefly , to comment on this question .
it is no secret to members of this Chamber that I came here almost 10 years ago from downtown Toronto because my constituents wanted somebody to make sure they had a voice that would always speak up for a strong national government .
paragraph 495 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Criminal Code allows a peace officer to arrest a person who has committed an indictable offence or who he finds committing a criminal offence .
they are about power for political parties at any cost .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
i would also like to thank the electorate of Brandon - Souris for putting me in this wonderful position in the House and for being able to speak today on Bill C - 4 on their behalf .
to make matters worse , the Speech from the Throne contains no commitment to national health care standards , no guarantees and no mechanisms to ensure co - operation with the provinces .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
that is false .
they will never get that bill accepted even by rank and file aboriginal people unless there is a parallel bill establishing mechanisms for financial accountability and democratic accountability on reserves .
is it not funny that 40 years later the current Liberal government continues to put a deaf ear to the concerns of western members of Parliament .
they asked that the growing costs of benefits be slowed to ensure the long term stability of the plan .
while Canada concentrated on security , at the Caisse , they wanted to diversify investments and also contribute to the development of Quebec .
but if a group of members band together , then perhaps influence can be achieved because the rules of the game are stacked against us .
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
i had the opportunity to hear her speak on other occasions , outside this House , and she displayed on those occasions the same attitude she is displaying today .
i was especially pleased to hear that the millennium fund will be directed primarily at low and modest income students .
for some years now under the Income Tax Act income from the forced destruction or sale of livestock as a result of a drought situation has been deferred .
and the government says that this is some kind of reform as though it is good ?
Mr. Randy White
we make that argument forcefully in our paper but the government has shut off that option by deciding it is going to spend its way to prosperity .
only 28 per cent of Quebec youth could name John A . Macdonald as our first prime minister , although 78 per cent of them could name Wilfrid Laurier as the first Francophone prime minister .
our premiers have learned a lesson from both Meech Lake and Charlottetown and are going to the people of Canada to hear what they have to say about their country .
as it happens , when he attacks the MP pension plan , he alludes to the fact that in the last Parliament the majority of Reform MPs , all but one , opted out of the pension plan .
Mr. Rob Anders
sitting RESUMED
we do have spending limits .
naming OF MEMBER
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) :
first of all , the Prime Minister has clearly explained the direction he plans to set for our team now and during the next mandate .
Mr. Speaker , I was sent here by the province of British Columbia and my constituents to -
Mr. Speaker , perhaps I may first thank my constituents for giving me this chance to come back to the Parliament of Canada to work on their behalf .
taxpayers are also paying twice for federal government employees to do the exact same job as Quebec government employees .
the Waterloo region is blessed with three excellent post - secondary institutions .
Mr. Alex Shepherd ( Durham , Lib . ) :
the families of politicians inevitably pay a price for this dedication .
i also want to point out to the member for Roberval that , when he was an MNA , he voted against the Meech Lake accord in the National Assembly .
i am therefore pleased to congratulate my colleague and I would like to hear what he has to say on these questions .
i am certainly pleased to be back and I will do my best to represent their interests .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
that is well known .
it never is .
VOISEY ' S BAY

hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
farmers are demanding it .
it will reinvest the money in Canada .
that the Committee be empowered to appoint , from among its members , such sub - committees as may be deemed advisable , and to delegate to such sub - committees all or any of its powers except the power to report to the Senate and House of Commons ;
the Speaker :
it being 6.15 p.m. , it is my duty to interrupt proceedings and put forthwith any question necessary to dispose of the business of supply .
the government is committed to providing a minimum transfer of $ 12.5 billion to the provinces and territories for health care .
that wealth and industrial prosperity has not spread across this country in the directions that we would like to see it spread .
Ms. Alexa McDonough
they reflect what was said during extensive public consultations that were held across Canada in 1996 .
the Speaker :
the Speaker :
Mr. Larry McCormick ( Hastings - Frontenac - Lennox and Addington , Lib . ) :
Ms. Albina Guarnieri
which of those two options is true ?
there are people who told me that I would never make it in the Reform Party , a party without official racial preferences for its candidates .
the Speaker :
some hon. members :
i would point out to him , and it is to this comment that I would like his reaction , that the Canada of today is operating under rules from the last century , when we are now on the eve of the next century .
most of the questions are very responsible .
the government has not talked about what the optimal size of debt , taxes and the level of government would be .
why ?
like all Bloc Quebecois members who spoke before me , I fully agree with the principle of the bill , since the overall objective of the reform is to preserve the sustainability of a public pension plan .
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett :
wherever this is done an unlevel playing field is created .
she called it the Ponzi scheme , which is not an unfair analogy .
hon. Jim Peterson :
the auditor general said that the government started implementing the program before it had finished the planning , that parliament was not given accurate progress reports , that the department did not have reliable data , and that other alternatives which would not have created dependency were not even considered .
these are the same people who said to Canadians that they were receiving letters from Canadians telling them to move the opposition into Stornoway .
yesterday I heard the NDP critic , the hon. member for Kamloops , compliment our efforts to reform the Canada pension plan as the economy changes .
the Minister of Human Resources Development told us that confidential lists are handed over to the ministers responsible for the various regions .
in particular , this minister talked about the child tax credit , a commendable albeit very modest effort on the part of this government .
i am pleased to say that during the course of this mandate the Government of Canada will at least double its initial investment of $ 850 million in this innovative program .
second , we have worked to develop a code of conduct for private businesses .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano
the assets of the CPP will be invested in a diversified portfolio of instruments in the best interests of the contributors and beneficiaries .
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
above all , family matters .
aboriginal peoples are recognized .
the bill would ensure that marriage remains what Canadians have always known it to be : a legal union between an unmarried female and an unmarried male .
while Canada is very much an exporting nation , we have not become a nation of exporters .
health CARE
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
i am rather amazed by that .
next year ' s budget surpluses will be attributable to the efforts of Quebeckers and the provinces .
the Speaker :
the motion is :
it is fair to say that the lifestyle in Europe is somewhat superior to the lifestyle in Chile without saying anything negative in particular about that country .
he drew attention to the fact that he could not find anywhere a clearly defined national fisheries policy on sustainable fisheries .
in the meantime , last Friday the officials involved made clear what their purpose was and that it was in accordance with a perfectly acceptable departmental purpose that the file was looked for .
we have become the third solitude in Canada .
RCMP INVESTIGATION
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy - Royal , PC ) :
oddly enough , we don ' t hear them talk about their electoral contributions in the last election .
this means that Canadians will have to pay $ 11 billion more a year in CPP premiums without the benefit of other tax cuts to offset this hike .
speech FROM THE THRONE
as we get into the balanced budget benefit that is supposed to be forthcoming , that should be done on its own .
yea .
will my colleague support me when I introduce a private member ' s bill to restore fiscal health ?
the government appears to be accepting some advice from the premiers , although we question this based on the Prime Minister ' s replies in question period today .
people have been saying that there is a need for real reform of this pension plan .
maybe my province of British Columbia should look at opting out the CPP and getting its own pension plan .
supreme COURT OF CANADA
who told him ?
we promised to move quickly in this new Parliament to make the Canadian Wheat Board more democratic , more accountable and more flexible and to place more decision - making authority in the hands of grain producers than ever before in history .
i would also like to congratulate you on your appointment to the Chair .
the hon. member for Roberval .
we will be able to say thanks to the previous Conservative government , I guarantee it .
also being examined are innovative ways to provide health care to an aging population that is on the whole healthier than the last generation and much more able to live at home for longer periods of time .
there were no more jobs created and the U.S. deficit went through the ceiling and they are still paying for it .
it came within a whisker of losing power .
ATLANTIC GROUNDFISH STRATEGY
what is important is that as a result of this government , for the first time in over 25 years there is going to be a surplus .
as hard as it was , it could have been very much worse if successive governments had not spent millions of dollars on the Red River floodway diversion system .
Quebec , Quebec , Quebec , and Quebec .
i would encourage the member over the next four or five years to do what is best for his riding , and that is to offer proactive , positive comments and suggestions on how we can make Canada better .
the House met at 2 p.m.
a reading of clauses 24 through 26 , which indicate that the CWB may , under certain conditions , recommend that certain types of grains be excluded from or added to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Canadian Wheat Board , leaves one confused .
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) :
when a seat became vacant on the Supreme Court , I asked , as is the custom , the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada to inquire and find the most competent person to fill this important position .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz
indeed , we are not at a level we would like .
i must tell him I am deeply touched by his kind words .
Mr. Speaker , the government of Lucien Bouchard , our designated premier , took quite a beating last night .
Mr. Speaker , those of us who have been around for a number of years , although not actually in the House of Commons , were shocked and saddened earlier this month to hear the news of the passing of an officer emeritus of this House , the former Clerk of the House , Mr. Alistair Fraser .
it finally acknowledged that British Columbia is unique from the prairie provinces .
while many of us on this side of the House respect the passion with which he speaks , I would state that his thinking is really a factor of the flat earth society of social democratic thinking that we keep hearing over and over again .
i certainly will endeavour to represent the people of my constituency in the province of Nova Scotia with vigour , honesty and integrity .
it has been mentioned time and time again , and there has not been one positive comment from members of the opposition .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
even Pierre Elliott Trudeau never dared to go this far .
this place is a stiff , dull place at the best of times .
i would like to read some quotes .
Mr. Jim Abbott
Mr. Speaker , it is very clear that anyone who misrepresents his identity or his reasons for coming to Canada can be prosecuted by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration .
perhaps the leader of the Reform Party does not fully grasp what one may call the consensus in Quebec .
if you have any doubt , just read the bill .
Mr. John Bryden
in terms of tax breaks for retirement savings , the Liberals received $ 300 million in new taxes from seniors by deciding that the old age tax credit would be included in income .
this fall , Canadians , especially young Canadians , begin to reap the rewards of what we have done together in the past four years .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te :
i sometimes wonder what it means to have a constitutional right if it can be made subject to the ebb and flow of public sentiment .
introduction and first reading
it has a $ 560 billion liability .
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) :
the Government finds it unacceptable that thousands of jobs are going unfilled in high - growth sectors of our economy at the same time as young Canadians are unemployed .
Mr. Speaker , as I mentioned in my comments , the work of the royal commission is a tremendous body of knowledge which is valuable not only to me as the minister responsible for Indian affairs but to other partners as well , the provinces , First Nations and Canadians .
saying that there is no difference is either very dishonest or very ignorant .
i am also hopeful that this new minister will be much more successful in her consultations and negotiations with the provinces .
that is simply not acceptable .
the security , affordability and stability of the CPP are an integral part of the Progressive Conservative Party ' s plan to address the economic and social insecurity felt by so many Canadians .
families are unable to spend that money because it has been taken from them by the taxes .
i think it is also important for those Quebeckers listening to know that very few Quebeckers are affected by the CPP , because a similar plan , the Quebec pension plan , was set up at the same time as the CPP .
i am asking it to correct the errors of the past .
would the Minister of Industry not expect Quebec to play a principal role , in the North American context , in setting up the francophone information highway ?
Mr. Rahim Jaffer
i would also like to take the opportunity of my maiden speech to pay tribute to the citizens of Beauharnois - Salaberry .
* * *
if Quebec votes to separate rest assured that British Columbians will review their options .
the reason I was doing it was that hopefully within a year or so I will be a little more proficient and able to address answers to the member in the French language .
that is why we need public pension and social plans to help create an equality position .
sixty - eight percent of youth service Canada graduates either returned to school or found meaningful work within six months of completing their placement .
petitions
i am both honoured and humbled by the support of the people of Kitchener Centre who have brought me here to Ottawa .
on August 25 , 1,000 people marched through the streets in support of keeping open a seniors ' residence in Saint - Flavien .
the minister says he has to take action because the inflation rate is at 1.8 percent .
we do have a process of disclosure .
what did the Liberals say back then in order to win the election ?
as I have discussed the bill responds to views expressed by numerous stakeholders .
we have a crisis of work in this country .
i have a question for her .
the Speaker :
once again , I get the impression they are laughing at us , that some members opposite are trying to fool the public .
it is time that they thought the 50:50 split on the surplus should have gone to something called taxes , to lower taxes .
the current prime minister should beware .
the Raglan mining company is located in the northern part of my riding .
they are listing many grievances against the crown , including having to surrender their homes without compensation when their current lease ends in the year 2010 .
that is why we have set forth initiatives like the family farm loan program introduced in the fall of 1994 . This program makes it easier for retiring farmers to hand the family farm down to the next generation without jeopardizing their own security and retirement .
i hope some serious offence is not happening in Canada .
if a person pays off a mortgage but never fixes the plumbing or the roof , I am not sure that person will have a house to live in at the end of 25 years .
food and Drugs Act
because this has not been a cursory commitment .
farmers are telling me it is time for an exorcism to get the devil out of the grain transportation system in the prairies .
given all this , you will agree with Canadian women in saying that , if the Liberals really want a just society , as they claim to in their speech , they forgot to show that they are concerned with economic equality for women , otherwise they would have acted differently .
the Department of Finance has access to econometric models of the Canadian economy that enable it to predict the employment effects of bills like this one and payroll tax increases .
i am sure members of the official opposition will appreciate , given the fact that most of them are from the beautiful province of British Columbia , the review of the British Columbia proposal , which was actually made after the CPP consultations were complete .
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
six days later , on January 28 , it was given approval by the regional Soci 茅 t 茅 qu 茅 b 茅 coise du d 茅 veloppement de la main - d ' oeuvre .
i add that to the volume of information that has been placed before you for your consideration , Mr. Speaker .

the overall pension system in Canada is designed to provide Canadians with a chance to blend several vehicles as they prepare for their retirement .
i focused on two things , both highlighted in the Speech from the Throne : our commitment to look after one another and our respect for multiculturalism .
today ' s generation of young Canadians is the best educated in our history .

every community in Canada celebrated its centennial in one manner or another .
they did not fire this bagmen until June , after the election , several months later .
Mr. Speaker , the minister tells us that he is concerned and I am sure that he is .
Mr. Speaker , correct me if I am wrong , but I believe that question period is there so the opposition to take the government to task for deeds it has either done or not done and answer to the people of Canada .
the conference is planned as an important step in a process of sharing and discovery aimed at economic recovery in Atlantic Canada .
they are being run by the private sector .
after all , Mr. Bastarache is a francophone -
we should not forget that the plan is jointly managed by the federal and provincial governments , and changes can only be made to it if approved by two - thirds of the provinces representing two - thirds of the population .
in the present case , when all Canadians are wondering how there can be a $ 12 billion surplus , when seasonal workers and new entrants to the labour market are being penalized , will the minister finally agree to shed some light on the situation so that we can finally learn where the money workers contribute to the fund , money the government used to reduce the deficit , is going ?
we want a reasonable transportation cost .
why is Jacques Roy , an assistant to the President of the Treasury Board , still working for the government in spite of the fact that his actions are currently under investigation ?
we are part of Canada and proud to be Canadians .
many of them had been persuaded by former Premier Wells that if we voted for Meech Lake it might put the nation on a road we would soon regret .
however , every work disruption and every strike results in labour getting some improvements in its situation , either in working conditions , benefits or wages .
the passage of time has taught us a few things .
this is the debate the country needs .
i am reminded of when the Liberals broke their promises on the GST .
first , they reduced the representation of the both the government party and the official opposition of the last Parliament ; fewer seats for the Liberals and fewer seats for the Bloc .
thus the impact of the changes will be shared among future retirees , future survivors of retirees and recipients of disability benefits .
the following members are eligible for the second ballot :
Mr. Speaker , would the Prime Minister confirm that the changes made in the free trade agreement were very marginal ones ?
throne SPEECH
i extend that same invitation to industry .
they have given up on politicians because they have come to believe that average Canadians are too powerless to change anything as large , amorphous and detached as the way things are done in political Canada .
i know , as all of us do , that poverty is an enemy of a good start whether in aboriginal communities or in the urban centres of Vancouver , Toronto , Montreal and Halifax .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
i will not go into all of the examples there are in the Speech from the Throne , because my ten minutes would not be enough , but I will list three of them .
years ago we went out and conducted town hall meetings in our ridings , asking the people of Canada what they wanted to do with the Canada pension plan .
i wonder why my hon. friend does not recognize that and stop raising innuendoes and insinuations that could harm the success of the process .
unfortunately , I do not have a specific answer to that question .
the DEBT
Mr. Speaker , the minister responsible for Canada Post announced that his strategy in negotiations with the postal union was first to let the workers strike and then to negotiate special legislation to force them back to work .
i appreciate the attention Liberal members have paid and I truly hope they will reconsider this in a non - partisan manner .
interest RATES
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the justice minister implied that the system used to select our federal court justices has worked well for 130 years .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
madam Speaker , I would like to congratulate the member on his eloquent speech in reply to the Speech from the Throne .
i find it surprising that my colleagues on the other side of the House would be scared that Canadians would actually pick up the Speech from the Throne and read it .
i find it sad that Canadians too cannot feel this pride over their own powerful financial institution that fulfils Canada ' s mission , like the one we have in Quebec that fulfils Quebec ' s mission .
many thousands of Canadians go to work every day just across the border because there is a lower tax climate there both at the corporate and personal levels .
it cannot seem to grasp the reality that there are a lot of people hurting .

and what has it done ?
having seen the Liberals make cuts in transfer payments for social programs that could reach a total of $ 42 billion between 1995 and 2003 , what are we to think when we see them announcing a new annual program worth some one hundred million dollars ?

another point is the whole question of survivors and death benefits .
over 800,000 Canadians are directly and indirectly employed in the forestry sector , yet the same government that claims to be so concerned with job creation strategies seems to give more credence to environmental lobby groups than it does to experts from within the industry .
in a certain sense he was experimenting with the exclusion clause of Bill C - 72 even before it became law .

he was very keen on ensuing that issues such as pensions were a priority and he asked us to ensure that the principles and fundamental issues which are important to all Canadians remain on the agenda of parliament .

again , we have to remind this government that , in the throne speech , far from giving up their power to spend , they are at it again , overlapping and duplicating , in the section dealing with young people .
that the Committee be directed to consult broadly and review such information as it deems appropriate with respect to this issue ;
but the sad reality is , and it came across loudly and clearly to me during the election campaign , that many citizens have lost faith in their politicians .
madam Speaker , allow me to congratulate you on your new duties .
i hope to conclude that I do not have to defend people , other than the government , in their views .
Mr. Speaker , will the President of the Treasury Board pledge to inform this House when a search is carried out , since a warrant was issued , as the minister himself acknowledged , will he pledge to state all the reasons why a warrant was issued to search his regional office , and why such a search was carried out ?
Mr. Alex Shepherd :
why do we not have four options ?
the Government will increase its resources devoted to helping youth to make a smooth and productive entry into the world of work .
there is a clause for the future that will allow the suspension of any contractual obligation on both the suppliers and the government in case of a strike or lockout .
i am saying that the public has made the sacrifices , that the public will continue to make the sacrifices and it is the government that has to make the sacrifices on its spending habits .
servicing that debt is now the hugest chunk of the pie that it takes to operate the business of this land .
in 1992 , in Rio , the Canadian government made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the 1990 level by the year 2000 .
i therefore seize this opportunity of my first debate in this Parliament to once more thank the people of Winnipeg North - St.
but it is an unfortunate thing that could be remedied by the Chair taking , admittedly , new responsibilities but not responsibilities that are totally out of character with what Speakers have done in other Parliaments , to intervene on behalf of the collective rights of parliamentarians to adequate debate on a matter of obvious national importance .
the facts are that in 1993 there were seven legislative counsel and today there are approximately two point something legislative counsel .
for the government of course two - thirds of its seats are in Ontario , with half of the remainder in Quebec .
i guess that is the same as the government asking for money .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member knows full well that we offered to compensate the provinces that lost money .
more importantly , they will decide what kind of nation Canada is as it begins a new century .
this will require a third referendum , and this time the yes side will win .
it cannot for a moment consider , and this was especially true under previous Liberal administrations , letting go of some power .
unfortunately there has been a litany of Liberal and Tory governments , dominated by central Canada , which have been quite happy to keep things just as they were back in the 19 th century .
i did not have the pleasure to sit in the House with him , but he was known in Parliament as a devoted and tireless advocate for veterans ' interests .
we will not act in the wasteful manner that the opposition parties would have everyone believe .

i could not help but to think about that young man growing up and the twists and turns his life would take over the next 40 years which would put him in a jet plane flying to a seat in this House of Commons .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
i was interested to hear that when he spoke to a group in Hungary he had the conviction to say that Canada was his home , but his place of birth was Hungary .
the pulp and paper industry has experienced certain difficulties .
i pledge to my constituents and to everybody else that I will do everything within my power to make sure not only us and our children but generations to come will inherit a country that is strong financially and indeed united .

the once great Liberal Party is running out of steam .
i would like to point out , and I hope all members agree , that over the past 130 - some years the appointment process by which supreme court justices have been appointed has led to some of the most distinguished and meritorious people serving on the Supreme Court of Canada .
i agree with that .
Mr. Speaker , let us put this into context for two seconds .
members of this Chamber phoned regularly to offer support , donated money , equipment and supplies .
our young people are well prepared and well placed to take advantage of the many opportunities arising from our increasingly high tech and knowledge based economy , for they are the best educated and most adept ever in the use of technology .
he can go on record and say that he would renounce that deal .
as I mentioned before , the government is taking a lot of pleasure in the growth in the stock market and how well Bay Street and Wall Street are doing , but it has forgotten that consumer confidence in Canada is at an all - time low .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
when I stood before you in January 1994 , many forecasted bleak economic harvests in our future .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to inform the House and all Canadians that October is national denturist awareness month .
what little information we have received so far on the government ' s proposal involves very fundamental issues for the future of pension plans in Canada .
we are saying that governments can step back and can trust the community to make those decisions .
would the minister confirm that he is preparing , through legislation , to impose his settlement in the matter of pay equity without awaiting the decision of the human rights tribunal , which may go against him ?
on this particular matter there seems to be consensus in the national assembly .
hon. Allan Rock :
this is perhaps the single most important action that government can take to ensure success in the knowledge based economy .
a mess began to develop .
when we were in Calgary for two days there was a lot of opportunity for walk - ins .
since the last Liberal throne speech promised to tackle youth unemployment , 26,000 more young people in this country have not been able to find jobs and they are not cheering .
over the last few decades we have seen a significant shift in taxation policy from corporations to individuals .
it has been blessed with a period of economic growth since it took office but that has not actually been translated into real jobs .
my question is for the Minister of Finance .
at present the rights of minorities are guaranteed in the Canadian Constitution .

i would now like to comment on the throne speech , a document which includes no firm commitment , except for the sad fact that the federal government intends to become a very centralizing entity .

however , why does the member and her party , in light of that kind of statement which I believe we both find to be true , continue to attempt to break up the best country in the world ?

furthermore , Canada is still lagging behind OECD countries as a whole .

Mr. Speaker , I would like to draw the hon. members ' attention to the actions taken by the Government of Canada to revive and develop the site of the military base and the airport area in Saint - Hubert and their surroundings .
the government must react to the World Trade Organization decision on split runs of American periodicals .

the Deputy Speaker :
i should remind him that this was done with the agreement of the individuals concerned .
that is something .
we agree with that assessment .
to date , the minister has refused to make the same commitment .
that at the conclusion of the present debate on the Opposition Motion , all questions necessary to dispose of this motion be deemed put and a recorded division be deemed demanded and deferred until Tuesday , October 21 , 1997 , at the expiry of the time provided for Government Orders .
i wish to speak in support of the Speech from the Throne , but I also wish to speak of this Parliament .
we have submitted them to our own forensic examination and that has confirmed the initial evaluation that the passports are forgeries .
it provides protection against periods of low or no earnings including years spent raising children .
in Quebec , those who have contributed for two out of the last three years , or five out of the last ten years , or for half of the contribution period , are eligible for disability benefits .
parliamentary committees have been part of the Canadian democratic tradition precisely so that experts , groups and citizens may express their points of view and so that citizens and their elected representatives can reach a better understanding of important issues .
we have discussed this issue on a number of fronts , having to do with questions of security and also questions of job security and so on .
Mr. Speaker , there are two parts to the question .
surely this is just the tip of the iceberg we are talking about right now , and it is important that the government one day shed light on this whole affair .
we are walking into what would be fundamental changes to people ' s pensions , but there are no numbers to back up what exactly it would do or how it would operate .

to answer my friend specifically , if he listened carefully he would have heard me say that the assumptions on which Bill C - 2 is based were based on a model that we believe is incorrect .
it will be a very important debate .
i was completely exasperated by what I read in the debates of that other place in this Parliament , the red chamber .
it is clear the government is not getting on with the job with the resources at its disposal .
in my functions , I visit with many units of the Canadian Forces .
the Cheviot mine proposal will place a large development in a pristine wilderness area across the divide from previous mine sites and adjacent to the Jasper National Park , a world heritage site .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
we see a Canada where more and more Canadians can maximize their potential and realize their dreams .
this new policy is consistent with that of most other pension funds in Canada , and in particular with that of the Quebec pension plan .
if the government really believed in the strength of leadership it would offer some leadership on interprovincial trade .
Ontario certainly has a very strong vested interest in how the Canadian Wheat Board operates .

if this is true , a renewed federalist system may bring this country together as a strong unified country as never before seen , a nation ready to face the challenges of the 21 st century .
Mr. Speaker , warmth and compassion are good commodities but they do not put milk on the table .
we owe it to ourselves , our families and our constituents .
hear , hear .
i want to begin today be giving a bit of the history of the Canada pension plan as we know it today .
as for the rights and powers of the House as a collectivity they may be classified as follows : the regulation of its own internal affairs , the authority to maintain the attendance and service of its members , the power to expel members guilty of disgraceful conduct , the right to institute inquiries and to call witnesses and demand papers , the right to administer oaths to witnesses , and the authority to deal with breaches of privilege or contempt .

( the House adjourned at 6.46 p.m. )
this is also not true .
that is where I differ from Reform Party members .
i would like to ask him whether the citizens of Edmonton - Strathcona , whom he represents , feel that Quebecers are a people and whether they feel that this people has the freedom to determine its future and to have its own country .
in June 1996 , she was appointed commissioner of the Immigration and Refugee Board at an annual salary of $ 86,400 .

our most valuable resource is our children , and yet we turn around and say to people that children with disabilities cannot receive proper education because we do not have the money .
the Deputy Speaker :
then there was the billion dollar student handout .
where are they going to be when they want to retire ?
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for his question .
maybe there are times when we should have a referendum to adjust the Constitution of Canada .
i believe that one way to celebrate our millennium would be for our government to strike a millennium medal .
i remember well feeling the wrath of many people in the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador because I voted in that way .

how can the government claim to be acting in compliance with a code of ethics when it stubbornly keeps on its payroll people who are said to have deliberately tried to corrupt entrepreneurs for the sole purpose of bringing money into the party ' s coffers ?
i would like to ask him a question .
the Reform Party was formed because the old parties no longer serve our interests .
i see struggling families dealing with unemployment or waiting for the axe to fall .
he wants the province of Quebec to separate from Canada but , when he talks about my expenses , he forgets that my family , my wife and my daughter , came to Ottawa , otherwise our family would have been separated .
the Speaker :
we succeeded , and have started to put in place a strong foundation for our success in the new millennium .
to give a better idea of where I am coming from , I would like to describe briefly the situation facing this country ' s youth .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien
i think these commitments , once translated into laws , budgets and programs and put into effect , will take Canadian societies to new horizons of development and growth and will enable Canada to remain at the forefront of the international community .
Mr. Speaker , my colleagues and I find it inconceivable that the Department of Finance would truly endorse a return to spending as the number one fiscal priority of the government .
we have a solid foundation to build on .
Mr. Scott Brison
i also find very interesting the comments of the member for Thornhill on the first question .
we are poised for success .
i would also like to salute voters in Anjou - Rivi 猫 re - des - Prairies and thank them for the mandate they gave me last June when they sent me here to represent them and serve them in co - operation with my team of assistants .
Mr. Speaker , maybe the hon. member should speak to his own ad campaign manager who said that he had no evidence that the process was unfair or weighted in favour of Liberal political allies .
another thing I should mention is what our competitors are saying .
it is not the destruction of a pension plan .
madam Speaker , in the brief 10 minutes I was given I did touch , in broad generalities , about confidence in government , integrity and so forth .
Mr. Peter Goldring :
all in all , eight provinces , including Quebec , have endorsed the proposed changes .
Mr. Speaker , for over two years consultation on the CPP took place right across the country , not only by the federal government but every provincial government had discussions in their houses .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i think that is proof enough that this government is going in the right direction and the integrity of our justice system is not put in question .
the member continues to refer to New Zealand as a model .
we chose to concentrate on a few clear , essential priorities we can deal with vigorously .
Mr. Speaker , for years we watched as the national Reform Party seduced the national Liberal Party into acting in a bizarre right wing Tory way .
the question is on the subamendment .
if we compare it to a privately managed fund today , the Caisse d 茅 pot et placement du Quebec has a fund which is now at about $ 57.6 billion , the Ontario Teacher ' s College pension plan is at about $ 50.9 billion and the municipal employees fund is at about $ 25.9 billion .
hon. Allan Rock
Mr. Speaker , that was very kind of you .
we have not heard a whole lot about that .
Mr. Rob Anders
Dr. Brill - Edwards is an expert .
this bill not only rises to the challenge , it supersedes it .
we can always point to the positive results of records in the 35 th Parliament .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
but all the pension plans went up last year even with the Bre - X situation .
he is simply making a representation .
the award is well deserved and we are very proud of her .
Canadian families and Canada ' s children are still waiting .
develop alternatives to incarceration for low - risk , non - violent offenders , such as sentencing reforms , community diversion programs , and alternative sanctions ; and
why was this matter not reported the moment the minister knew of it ?
Mr. Speaker , I do not know if two or three years from now whether anyone will remember this speech , but I will give it anyway .
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
the Speaker :
it was hotly debated , but its defenders , Prime Minister Pearson , Minister Martin and MP Douglas , won out .
maybe he could understand that this time .
recently the finance minister visited my constituency and 344 persons came to listen to his speech .
i spent about 13 years in the Newfoundland House of Assembly .
health
it is committed to acting at home to reduce our contribution to these problems .
i am encouraged by the process , the skill and the passion of members of this House in exercising their duties to their constituents and our fellow Canadians .
the member has not addressed the fact that we will now be setting up an $ 11.5 billion investment fund , of which 80 percent will be invested in this country .
every 30 minutes another Canadian woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and more than 5,400 women die of the disease every year .
Mr. Speaker , I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment as Acting Speaker .
i would call on the Quebec members across the way to stop acting like colonials and to help us out .
however , when there is a minority group , then I do not believe that without its consent we should take away those rights .

hon. Paul Martin
the hon. member for Thunder Bay - Atikokan .
these are not rumours .
i am sure he debated with other candidates who were seeking election .
when it was promised stable financing , it actually got cuts .
marine biologists , scientists , librarians , teachers , health care workers , radio and film producers , thousands and thousands of important community strengthening jobs have disappeared in the interests of balancing the budget .
Mr. Preston Manning :
but what does this have to do with secession ?
we are working very hard on this .
in 1996 the prime minister and provincial and territorial first ministers made a commitment to improve the way governments work together to help children in poverty .
that is the economic record of this government . Youth unemployment is over 17 percent .
as a father of two teenage daughters , one in high school , the other in university , I am proud to say that they view , as I do , race and colour as transparencies .
the strategy seeks to promote job creation through innovation and investment , reinforce Canadian cultural sovereignty and identity and to ensure that we have universal access to the information highway wherever we are in Canada .
my goal in my second mandate is to continue to serve my constituents and Canadians with honesty and integrity , as this government has shown , to remain accessible and approachable to those I represent and finally to remind them of the important role they play in shaping Canada ' s public policy .
Mr. Speaker , we are proud of the work we have done in the disabled community .
this is from the ex MP for Beaus 茅 jour , the prime minister himself .
No.
cutting off debate after one and a half days is a massive insult to Canadians .
we stood up for and spoke to a rule based mechanism .
madam Speaker , there is no question one of the root causes of the ongoing demand for health care will be the determinants , jobs being one of them .
the residents also applauded the government ' s continued resolve in the area of youth unemployment and took the opportunity to call on local businesses , community organizations and all levels of government to continue to work together to create opportunities for youth .
just before Motions is First Reading of Senate Public Bills .
i now draw your attention to employment insurance .
the chief actuary of the fund tells us that the CPP paid a real return after inflation of 22.5 percent for those retiring in 1979 .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
we recognize the importance of allowing Canadians access to appropriate natural products which they believe will enhance their health .
hon. Jean J . Charest :
Mr. Speaker , I want to point out that the agreement is valid , but that the motion must have an indication that it carried on division .
resumption of debate on Address in Reply
it must be noted that on July 1 , the government did not hesitate to take down our flag from our Parliament to replace it with the Queen ' s standard to show how dominated we are .
who was asleep at the switch ?
hon. David Kilgour
we simply allowed it to transpire .
thousands of good paying , important community strengthening jobs again are being put on the chopping block and then put out to tender to the lowest bidder .
i ask the House , does that make any sense whatsoever ?
some hon. members :
for goodness sake , there is no betrayal of democratic principles here .
they were trying to make sure that his job was not transitional .
i would like to ask the member the question the finance minister could not answer .
we argue that it is demand .
the same goes for foreign affairs .
finally , I would like to ask this of the hon. member who just spoke .
this is the one subsection that specifically mentions the province of Quebec .
as a matter of fact , I will read the Projected Order of Business for today .
Mr. Speaker , as was mentioned , committees make their own decisions .
rules for Canada and for other countries are the equalizer .
we will also be introducing legislation with respect to the seniors benefit which will again benefit lower income Canadians and ensure that nine out of ten women who are seniors will be better off down the road .
in the words of the throne speech :
the Speaker :
the federal government has consistently denied its responsibility for the disabled .
Mr. Speaker , there are two ways to destroy the Canada pension plan .
he also said that the motions we have passed with respect to the amendments would allow each member of Parliament to speak three times .
my riding is also home to some of the oldest African - Canadian communities in Canada .
it provides every child with a fair chance in life , as the prime minister spoke so eloquently about yesterday , and it maintains a united country able to fulfill these values and reach the dreams he talked of yesterday in the House .
as the employer my share would have been $ 650 times 10 . The gross profit for one - eighth of my productivity as a builder would have gone to pay the increased CPP premiums .
he accuses me also of shirt rending , Madam Speaker , and I want to give you this assurance .
madam Speaker , if my colleague had given me notice of the question ahead of time , I could have been very specific .
the government has targeted growth strategies that focus on knowledge intensive sectors where we are stronger and have good prospects for new growth and global leadership , areas such as biopharmaceuticals , the environment and information and telecommunications .
Mr. Speaker , prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among Canadian men , with an estimated 80 men being diagnosed every working day .
the federal government has a role to play in supporting research and development and its uses within the business world .
the health care system is going to be used at a very high rate as this segment of the population ages .
we encourage the collection of catalogues of best practices around the country so that can be shared with communities .
let us not be too anxious to go over and pat them on the backs as they are expecting .
standing ORDERS
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate my colleague from Kitchener Centre not only on her maiden speech but also on her excellent replies .
i do not think that contributes to a discussion on how we do things better for the people we represent .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
if the government continues to insist on being at those negotiations , at the very least it should be doing what the Canadian people insist it be doing , and that is making sure that our ability as a people and our ability as a government to act in our own interests is protected by the various exemptions which the government should be seeking in the MAI negotiations .
i will continue to do that as long as I am a member of Parliament .
Mr. Rick Casson
what we would like to know is who knew , when did they know and what have they done in the meantime to ensure that this practice has stopped ?
more recently the prime minister has pledged the scholarship initiative , an even greater investment in what is the ultimate natural resource in this country , our young people .
this is not a question of privilege .
the Canadian health information system is another example of the federal government ' s centralizing tendencies .
the minister of Indian affairs has a fiduciary responsibility which encompasses the whole of the cabinet and the government to ensure that the funds that are directed to the chiefs and councils of those reserves reach the grassroots people .
the petition was initiated to confront the problem with snowmobile safety , the cause of many winter deaths .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal
i ask all hon. members to please direct your comments to the Chair .
there is no harm going to the people in his province and asking them what they think about this amendment .
i am sorry that the hon. member did not get a chance to ask a question , but I am sure he will have an opportunity later in the day .
some hon. members :
this could generate some concern among Canadians who , in the past , have been hard hit because of high interest rates , with a large number of businesses having to fold and many families nearly went going bankrupt because of high mortgage rates .
i wish we could reduce them to a nominal amount .
BRITISH COLUMBIA
that self - destruction will not take too many years .
last year , we suggested three possible approaches .
i would ask the hon. member to hearken back to the last time there was reform , when the Conservative Party sought to bring in pension reform on the backs of the lowest income earners , on the poorest in the country .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
the premiers of the various provinces have said it is time to consult the rest of Canada in order to have real change in the federation .
the fact is that Quebec has not lost any money .
debt SERVICING AND REDUCTION ACCOUNT ACT
we will work to better equip ourselves , our partners , our government and Canadians to forecast the needs of our economy .
then it said they may have been forged or stolen .
i can assure the member that this minister will take those representations and look at the matter .
however , these multimillion dollar trade deals do not happen just because the prime minister touched down in a jet with his entourage in tow .
some hon. members :
we must break down interprovincial trade barriers .
adjournment PROCEEDINGS
what the previous government did during the last recession was increase the premiums precisely at the time when firms and employees required a relief in premiums .
this is the directive of our humanity to which we are all instinctively called .
however , according to his department this is hogwash .
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate you on your appointment as a Speaker of this great House .
i would especially like to pay tribute to my family and to the hundred or so volunteers who worked so hard throughout the campaign .
some farmers in the Yorkton - Melville area have been denied this year ' s initial payment from the wheat board because they have not been able to pay back last year ' s initial payment .
agreed .
when we start talking about tax cuts and hitting higher income groups more efficiently , we do not consider the demographics of our population .
i wonder if that is agreeable to the House .
this has to stop .
these numbers do not even acknowledge the spin off effect the culture also brings to our economy .
* * *
not only has the federal government failed to create the jobs it promised in its red book , but it has used the unemployed to reduce its deficit .
i would also point out they are very much a part of our present .
Mr. Speaker , I rise to ask that the hon. leader of the Conservative Party be afforded the same privilege which was afforded the leader of the New Democratic Party , that he be , by the unanimous consent of the House , permitted to finish his remarks .
unfortunately I think he may be right .
presence IN THE GALLERY
he left his stamp on two editions of Beauchesne , which is something of a bible in the work of the House .
it seems to be satisfied with penalizing families who make the sacrifice of giving up a second income to get by .
Ms. Judi Longfield ( Whitby - Ajax , Lib . ) :
if the hon. member would listen he would know that I specifically said it was in the red book .
until recently the government has also been putting all its unity eggs in one basket , a basket with a hole in it .
in this day and age we have an opportunity through history to learn the lessons of economics , especially the economics over the last 30 years .
Mr. Michel Gauthier
as I said , speeches from the throne are always set up by any government due to the fiscal situation .
i look forward to hearing from the parliamentary secretary exactly what the government ' s position on this will be .
what is it going to be ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien :
we can stand still and not move forward or we can move forward together .
this is the case with Vietnam , China and other countries .
Mr. Speaker , the misappropriation of funds the government and the Liberal Party are allegedly involved in occurred in the regions , and in particular that of the Prime Minister of Canada .
as a member of this House I have been disempowered in carrying out my duties .
Mr. Speaker , if we are to have quality debates in this House , members would do well not to distort what has been said .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
the Speech from the Throne may talk about a " tolerant and highly diverse society '' , but the government still fails to recognize the basic historical fact that Quebec is one of the founding peoples of this country .
we are not only talking about tollgating , influence peddling and political patronage on a riding or regional basis .
we are poised to have the strongest growth among the world ' s largest economies .
it will continue to move forward with reforms to the Canadian military .
on top of all of that , it fails to provide any numbers as to how it will pay for its proposals .
it is also accepted that while there are a number of Canadians who are sympathetic , appreciative and understanding of what science , innovation and technology can do , there are many many others who do not .
i do not know if it is a new fact , but I want people to know that it is a fact the NDP shares the concern raised by the hon. member and others who have brought it to the attention of the Chair .
i thank the government for its intention to act diligently regarding linguistic school boards , because such is the wish of the National Assembly .
he mentions 36 years of anger yet the solution I hear him proposing is more of the same .
we have the worst record in the G - 7 countries of trade barriers within our own country .
as members know , the Reform Party has done a tremendous amount of work on raising these issues not only with the government but also with the public .
i would like to ask the hon. member whether , when he came to Montreal during the 1995 referendum campaign , it was really in order to save Canada , or was it because of the attraction of a reduced $ 95 flight from Vancouver to Montreal ?
exports have increased to records never before imagined .
Mr. Speaker , I can only add that the person whose integrity was attacked by the CBC and subsequently by everyone else has formally demanded that the CBC make a retraction , because he is not under investigation by the RCMP .
it will come from the people who work , the people who want a fair pension when they retire .
in the Conservative Party six provinces are represented , including a great proportion from Atlantic Canada .
there are provisions for implementation of quality control .
then they are told " We do not think your ideas will work , so you will not get a chance to try them '' .
income TAX ACT
i totally agree that is one of the best approaches we should have to this problem .
the minister should admit he made a mistake in his plan and he should at least put aside the budget cutting scheme developed in 1996 .
there has been no definition anywhere about what constitutes , for instance , a tax break .
in the last two years and during the election campaign a number of things struck me about our country that are worth repeating today .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
if a spouse passes away there is a continuing benefit to the surviving spouse even if they are under 65 years of age .
Mr. Speaker , briefly to the issue of Reaganomics , during the Reagan era after the U.S. government cut taxes to top marginal rate , employment in the U.S. increased by 17 million jobs and revenues doubled .
unfortunately he was not listening .
Mr. John Solomon
it is also clear that the people of Canada voted to reinvest in building a stronger society , an increased ability to look after those less fortunate .
i am truly heartened by the government ' s announcement that it is increasing its contribution to the Canada child tax benefit by $ 850 million a year , with higher payments to families beginning July 1 , 1998 .
now the deficit is being eliminated and they say " Well gee , we don ' t like the way this is being done '' .
the Speaker :
Mr. Speaker , perhaps the hon. member missed my response to an earlier question on this point .
Lester B . Pearson ' s legacy has completely disappeared .
in 1991 , after the public works department accepted the bid of the property management company RAMCO D 茅 veloppement Inc. , the latter invested $ 1.7 million to expand its building located in downtown , so it could accommodate the Saint - J 茅 r 么 me CEC and meet the department ' s requirements .
* * *
we tightened the rules for early parole hearings .
they want more control , and that is what Bill C - 4 will provide .
Mr. Speaker , I submit to you that on the third day of debating this bill , the purpose of which is to refer it to committee after years of consultation in the public generally , to move it to committee so we can hear witnesses on this federal - provincial agreement is not wrong .
a member of the minister ' s staff is under investigation , yet the minister does nothing .
i am hopeful that this Parliament will similarly encourage its citizens to do great things .
it is not hard to see why when we look at the regional interests of the opposition parties that environment is no longer a national issue .
the legislation must contain specific goals for debt reduction expressed as a fixed debt to GDP ratio and what portion of fiscal dividend will be in cut taxes and what portion is to be reinvested in national priorities such as health care and education .
will the minister mail a copy of the Calgary declaration to every household in Quebec , or will he be intimidated by the Premier of Quebec on this vital issue of consultation ?
the Bloc Quebecois agrees in principle with the contents of Bill C - 2 at second reading .
that is hogwash .
the minister responsible for Quebec , who is also the President of the Treasury Board , told us , although this was said outside this House , he received confidential listings not only from Human Resources Development Canada but also from other departments .
what went wrong ?
we will be balancing the budget in 1998 - 99 .
why do they have to go through this ?

i note that the government has made some modest changes in its approach to national unity , small steps I suggest , but in the right direction .

the Speaker :
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
my question is for the Prime Minister .
it is getting prompt , priority attention which is important to prairie farmers .
members
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) :
but you only find that out after you have lost .
the government must provide the funds to ensure consistent , well trained police forces at every port and not allow a hodge - podge of enforcement arrangements all over the country which will make Canada the country of choice for illegal immigration and drugs .

speech FROM THE THRONE
that the House of Commons do unite with the Senate in the appointment of a Special Joint Committee of the House of Commons and the Senate to study matters related to the proposed resolution respecting a proposed Amendment to Section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 concerning the Quebec school system ;
i admit that corporate profits have never been higher and the banks are happier than they ever have been in our banking history .
their parents are poor because the government has focused all its attention on one thing : the deficit .
in Quebec , all of the province ' s political leaders agree on the rules governing Quebec ' s move to sovereignty .

what was his own contribution ?
i was also struck by the impact of pollutants in Canada ' s Arctic and how they can affect people living in the area .
* * *
that is a very good solid principle .
* * *
Mr. Speaker , I would like to clarify a couple of points that have been made on Bill C - 4 .
this is important too in deciding what the state itself can do best and what the state should concede to the community as a better place for certain things to get done .
the reforms the government is pursuing in part with the legislation on the Canada pension plan today will maintain the three pillar retirement system .
pursuant to Standing Order 78 ( 3 ) , I give notice that , at the next sitting of the House , I will be moving a motion for the purpose of allotting a specified number of days or hours for the consideration and disposal of proceedings at that stage .
to send it to committee for detailed study is not wrong .
there was a flood in Manitoba .
the 1995 - 96 annual report tabled in this House states :
Mr. Jason Kenney
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
i am not an expert but I love Gregorian music .
businesses are expanding , building new buildings and plants and facilities .
Mr. Speaker , none of us expect when we start out each day that our homes or offices might be destroyed by fire .
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) :
this is one of the things which define our country and a source of general pride .
he needed the farmers .
the actuarial report on which the changes are based , in the opinion of some economists , which I happen to share , contains very pessimistic projections .
it is desirable for that purpose to amend the Constitution Act , 1867 , so that Quebec has full capacity to act in matters of education .
we read in the speech that " A connected nation is more than wires , cables and computers '' .
that the Committee have the power to sit during sittings and adjournments of the House ;
on a point of order , Madam Speaker .
in other words , if someone makes a further contribution they do not receive a tax benefit .
CESO is a non - profit , volunteer based organization which transfers Canadian expertise to businesses , communities and organizations in Canada and abroad .
madam Speaker , are we having questions and comments , or resuming debate ?
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
sometimes , there are potholes along the way and it is necessary to patch up here and there .
Mr. Speaker , with all due respect to my colleague , I would like to correct three things he has just said .
we know how difficult it is in usual times , and these are unusual times .
if there are other facts , let us stick to the facts and I will hear them .
when we know that 4,000 people are now waiting for their application for disability benefits to be heard by the CPP appeal tribunal , we are entitled to wonder whether the government is not trying to drag out the process so that people will receive reduced benefits under the new rules .
made it tough to co - operate
ironically one of the most vocal opponents to this abuse at that time was the very minister who has given notice and intends to close off debate on Bill C - 2 after only eight hours of debate on the very first bill to hit this floor , a bill that is over 100 pages long and extremely technical and a bill that happens to have attached to it a schedule which imposes a payroll tax rise of 73 % on millions of Canadians and employers .
this 1965 speech should be read over and over in Quebec , as it enables us to draw several conclusions , two of which I would like to go over for the benefit of the House .
it seems to me that is very effective action by the Canadian government .
Mr. Speaker , you must judge whether an amendment that you will be receiving later is in order .
i am hoping that all members of this House will support this very important bill .
health CARE
the Deputy Speaker :
who can argue with that ?
Mr. Roger Gallaway
if you were to speak for Canadians who want a reasonable approach , who do not oppose Quebeckers ' wish for full autonomy , that would perhaps be a productive route for the next century , both for Quebec and for Canada .
members
NEWFOUNDLAND
Mr. Speaker , I find it quite incredible to be sitting here in the House listening to a member of the Conservative Party .
let us wait for the police to do their job and get to the bottom of this .
we have gentler winters and warmer summers than we have here in the nation ' s capital and that is why our tender fruit is so sweet and our wine is just right .
as I am sure is the case with everyone present , there were burning issues which compelled me to run for office and to take my place here .
first of all , the system ' s viability must be ensured for future generations .
the changes are reflective of the Liberal government ' s belief in assisting , providing and protecting those in need .
as he said during his speech , trade is a very important area for Canada .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
free TRADE AGREEMENT
the throne speech outlined a strategy for expanding opportunities in aboriginal communities .
the governor of the bank has simply eased off on the accelerator a little in order to maintain the tremendous economic recovery and the very strong job creation we are seeing .
the amendment he proposed in essence gave legs to this principle which this member has been talking about today .
i hope the Reform Party will understand that the five options offered by the Constitution Act , 1982 are clearly worded so that we can make no mistake as parliamentarians that we are right to put Quebec ' s resolution into effect according to the bilateral amending formula .
he really objects to the way that bureaucrats say they are losing tax revenues because of exemptions .
Mr. Daniel Turp :
he mentioned that when he was young he remembers sitting in kitchens in Saskatchewan , shooting pool in Newfoundland and that kind of thing .
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire
i want to extend on behalf of my colleagues and I am sure on behalf of everyone our condolences to his family and our great appreciation of the gift that they gave to us , all the hours that Stanley Knowles spent in this place day after day , night after night .
it honoured the democratic choice of Quebeckers .
may Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations .
however this is not enough .
how can this government not have its hands tied by all this generosity on the part of corporate Canada ?
it is clear that the government intended to sign , seal and deliver the MAI before the last election , even without consultation .
Mr. Randy White
when the ballots were counted the seats were allocated , whether we like it or not , the way we see them in the House .
this experience and exposure has been invaluable to me as a member of Parliament and has allowed me already to help explain to the people of St. Paul ' s the need for even greater understanding .
it is a riding where the business community is very vibrant , where businesses are increasing in number , creating more jobs , upgrading their facilities and exporting more and more .
i believe that the then minister of finance , Michael Wilson , wanted to cut the deficit but he did not get the support of his prime minister , and I did .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
on page 72 there is a quote from the report of the Select Committee on the Official Secrets Act of 1939 which states that " a proceeding in Parliament covers both the asking of a question and the giving written notice of such a question '' .
the Liberal government now has to repair the damage it did in its first mandate and reinvest in the programs it had previously cut .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
at this time I will not go into any great detail about the proposed amendment as the government will be introducing the amendment as Motion No. 4 which will be debated after the special joint committee reports .
access TO INFORMATION
her notion of charity was not to hold black tie fundraisers and send others to do the messy work .
the repression of 1837 - 38 led to the sacking of a half dozen villages , the hanging of a dozen patriots , the exile of thousands of people and the incarceration of 400 in a city of 60,000 .
does the Prime Minister recognize , and I hope he has the courage to rise and respond to the question , that in addition to using the Supreme Court of Canada for strictly political purposes , he has just undermined its credibility with this highly partisan appointment ?
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of National Revenue .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed . )
now unshackled by deficit , the Liberals talk of new spending while other parties speak of debt reduction before tax relief .
i was involved when the position was created , but the government opposite completely disregarded the remarks and requests of the Bloc Quebecois , the official opposition at the time .
the hon. member for Calgary Southwest talked forever about payroll taxes .
canada can only exist if it is supported by the values of compassion and sharing .
canada PENSION PLAN
before concluding , I would like to add a few words concerning how well the issue of the renewal of the Canadian social union is progressing .
bill C - 247 .
if this government does not move in a bold and decisive way and take action to develop a strategy for real economic recovery in Cape Breton , then they will have done nothing but to continue their legacy of hopelessness and despair .
as they go down the river a din is heard in the distance .
if the House gives its consent I intend to move concurrence in the first report later this day .
the directors will now choose their own chair rather than leave that power with the minister .
in conclusion , there are several ways that a dual market or voluntary marketing through the Canadian Wheat Board , or similar results , could be achieved under Bill C - 4 .
Mrs. Jean Augustine
ALLOTED DAY - FEDERAL PARTY FINANCING
it took a chance by complaining to the minister about the harassment it had been subjected to and about what was a rather questionable practice .
( 2 ) All the Powers , Privileges , and Duties at the Union by Law conferred and imposed in Upper Canada on the Separate Schools and School Trustees of the Queen ' s Roman Catholic Subjects shall be and the same are hereby extended to the Dissentient Schools of the Queen ' s Protestant and Roman Catholic subjects in Quebec ;
they have wrenched an extra $ 25 billion out of the pockets of Canadian businesses and Canadian workers by raising taxes in more than 36 different areas .
if we want a strong national identity , we must ensure that control over our cultural institutions , publishing houses , radio and television networks and film productions rests with us .
it is looking at it from the point of view that we have to ensure an income for people in their retirement and we have to make it affordable not only in terms of premiums but in job creation and sustainability .
it is interesting to note that he and his party have picked up on the lead that Reform took on Bill C - 72 in the last parliament .
she mentioned in her speech the little phrase " paying off the deficit '' .
we were the test case .
i thank the hon. member for that intervention .
Mr. Ted McWhinney
government EXPENDITURES
Canadians come from many different parts of the world .
it is is clearly the spoken intention of the Minister of Industry to say very clearly that these grants are to be in support of and to develop small industry in Canada .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
while , I lost my mother to breast cancer five years ago , I am very proud to say that one of my sisters is now doing leading edge research at the University of Ottawa .
otherwise , the next Parliament may very well represent a much smaller and a much sadder Canada .
Mr. Speaker , this weekend more than 4,000 police officers and their families will travel to Ottawa to pay tribute to their colleagues who have fallen in the line of duty .
this is another area where we must continue on to help those communities that do not have major banking centres and financial centres but which need access to capital .
today , at the beginning of this new Parliament , an important issue is resurfacing : the Liberal Party is accused of influence peddling and of using lists that may have been obtained from influential ministers in this government .
that , notwithstanding usual practices , if the House or the Senate are not sitting when the final report of the Committee is completed , the report may be deposited with the Clerk of the House which is not sitting , or the Clerks of both Houses if neither House is then sitting , and the report shall thereupon be deemed to have been presented in that House , or both Houses , as the case may be ; and
the Speaker :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to say that I listened enviously to the remarks by the Reform Party member on the list of government expenses .
Elora , Fergus , Jacobs , Elmira , Baden , New Hamburg , Harrison and Palmerston .
i also want to take this opportunity to thank my constituency staff who served me well in the last Parliament and who continue to provide the support I need ; my Hill staff , Carole and Donald , my constituency staff , Anne Simone and Phil Sbrocchi , and all who worked to support me in my duties .
Mr. Speaker , the finance minister knows that it is intellectually dishonest in the extreme to suggest that we want to destroy the Canada pension plan .
canada Pension Plan
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
the purpose of the bill is to amend the Criminal Code so that every person who testifies in proceedings relating to a sexual offence or assault , or in which the offender allegedly used , attempted to use or threatened to use violence , is afforded the same protection as witnesses under 14 years of age are currently afforded under the Criminal Code .
i heard a member on the other side the other day talking about Bre - X because our plan would involve using the private sector .
i would like to know whether he agrees with his friends Guy Bouthillier of the Soci 茅 t 茅 Saint - Jean - Baptiste - another extremist - and Raymond Villeneuve , a former FLQ member who beats up people in Ville LaSalle in the name of an independent Quebec , when they said at a recent press conference : " We have to prepare , we have to raise an army in Quebec and be ready for any eventuality , we have to have our guns ready if need be '' .
hon. Allan Rock
i remember seeing him the night before his stroke .
Mr. Preston Manning
however it has often struck me that those who claim to have the monopoly on tolerance , compassion and understanding turn out to be the least tolerant , compassionate and understanding as they attempt to force through their agenda .
it affects their studies .
if the former justice minister believed this , why did he order a new investigation into this issue when the contents of the secret documents filed with the Supreme Court of Canada were made public during the last week of the federal election ?
those who have had very modest incomes throughout their working lives have not been able to afford the $ 14 billion of public subsidy that is provided to people who can save for RRSPs and which the Reform Party wants to increase to the benefit of its wealthy friends .
is the minister aware that this is why he is directly responsible for the bankruptcy of Alphastar and its impact -
Mr. Claude Drouin
the National Research Council ' s industrial research assistance program has been helping SMEs right across this country .
it is a responsibility that I do not take lightly .
at the rate things were going , there would have been no money left in the fund by the year 2015 , at which time contribution rates to the Canada Pension Plan would have had to be raised from 6 percent to 14 percent .
Mr. Speaker , I would suggest that the member across the way keep his shirt on and take a look at the facts .
we have more barriers to trade within our provincial borders than all of the European Community members combined .
given that the federal government has spent over $ 80 billion on this matter since 1969 , could the prime minister give us an accounting of what went wrong ?
we will establish centres of excellence to deepen our understanding of children ' s development .
any legislation the government introduces is debated here , but often it seems that the real meat of the legislation is contained in the corresponding regulations .
there are of course tax preferences that some large companies have which I think are unreasonable in terms of creating a hugely complex tax system and which require tens of thousands of tax lawyers , accountants and bureaucrats at Revenue Canada at untold public expense to administer .
never before has a Speech from the Throne so openly threatened Quebeckers ' right to decide their own future .
for the benefit of those watching in Quebec , I would like to make a few cursory comparisons between the proposed reform of the Canada Pension Plan and that of the Quebec Pension Plan .
* * *
those listings do cause concern and do give individuals a sense that their communities are unsafe .
in all her work she was supported by her own family , her two daughters and her devoted husband Doug .
hence , the attempt is being made to create the MAI .
contribution rates will rise over the next six years from the current rate of 5.85 % to 9.9 % and then remain steady instead of rising to 14.2 % in the year 2030 as predicted by the chief actuary .
Mr. Speaker , the Canada pension plan is a payroll tax and so is the EI premium .
the Speaker :
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
i think of some of the things that we are going to have to do .
madam Speaker , I will share my time with the hon. member for Laurentides .
last year New Zealanders were given on average a $ 200 per month income tax reduction .
* * *
i know all members would like me to wish him well .
the bottom line is that the likelihood of that option being exercised , the likelihood of people having access to liberty , as I think the reference was by the member to an open door policy , is not really reflective of the likelihood of that happening .
he says he is actually afraid that I may be serious .
Mr. Speaker , the whereabouts of the passports at this point are not known at least to myself .
we know that in Quebec the Caisse has been an unqualified success as an economic development tool for Quebeckers .
i would like him to give us a little comment on the record of the Liberals versus the record of Reformers on listening to the people , responding to them and representing them in this House .
it may be a small thing to some people , but normally in the course of our day ' s Routine Proceedings , bills are routinely brought before the House of Commons , the elected house in this Parliament , for printing and for examination .
out of the 40,000 people we were working with , some 15,000 were adjusted out of the groundfish industry .
second , I must thank the constituents of Kitchener - Waterloo for the honour of re - electing me to serve as their representative in the 36 th Parliament of Canada .
we are hearing directly more and more from a growing number of grassroots people on a number of reserves across the country that they are living in poverty conditions which are leading to an enormous degree of violence , alcohol and drug abuse .
* * *
Mr. Speaker , first I want to say thank you to the new member who just spoke .
Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr 芒 ce - Lachine , Lib . ) :
if he is telling the truth , I ask will he break ranks with his party and respect the majority of Quebeckers as they demonstrated in the last referendum ?
is it going to continually look back over its shoulder at old ideas and concepts from the past or is it going to squarely face the future ?
when the Leader of the Opposition asked whether or not Canada had been asked for permission by a foreign country to use our passports he said : " I have never been informed of any such request by any government '' .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Peter Stoffer
president Clinton and Vice - President Gore have been front and centre consulting Americans on global warming issues .
they have expanded it in many communities .
children are our most precious resource .
Mr. Speaker , that has been one of the big concerns of people who have already retired , who have no capacity to increase their earning power , especially for those Canadians for whom the CPP was primarily intended .
from a certain point of view , the answer is no .
Mr. Lesage ' s polite remarks about the Caisse ' s role are summed up a bit more bluntly by Mr. Parizeau in a book of memoirs .
we do this to provide for our families and for our future .
government endorsement of the joint panel ' s recommendations was equally important .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
Mr. Speaker , it is my intention to share my time with my colleague from Langley - Abbotsford .
they did worse .
we welcome innovation and new ideas .
customs
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
i was not there on a cheap flight .
we all realize opposition members are here to oppose , and I suppose some would say to criticize .
that is what the finance minister is talking about .
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
this is a very serious question on behalf of these very distraught people .
it should be noted that Canadians will start to receive regular statements on the pensions they are earning .
in this regard , on July 26 , the Rivi 猫 re - du - Nord RCM undertook to review its development plan in an interim control resolution , which provided , and I quote : " That any new government or quasi government service be established in downtown Saint - J 茅 r 么 me '' .
we in Quebec are not the only ones who think that the federal government stole $ 2 billion from us .
as I understand it right now , he is falling dramatically in the polls .
does he condemn what we have done in terms of innovation ?
Mr. Speaker , tomorrow the House will consider a motion to refer to committee before second reading Bill C - 9 , the marine legislation .
the government quickly needs to get out of the Quebec City to Windsor corridor so it can hear from the people in the rest of the country and begin to address their concerns .
i will add that , in the areas we are trying to help , that is to say international trade and technology , a third company like Bombardier would benefit Quebec far more than a third referendum .
could the Prime Minister tell us if this is indeed his government ' s actual strategy to resolve the postal issue ?
Mr. Jack Ramsay :
the government ' s decision to wind down federal support for Canadians with disabilities will mean repetitions of the Toronto incident as the divide between the elite and the street widens .
Mr. Bill Blaikie
when one talks about the responsibility of that board , the Ontario Wheat Board which is a very heavy producer of wheat as well is under the Canadian Wheat Board .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
what a contrast with the last legislature .
canada POST CORPORATION
let me ask about a very specific concern .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
let us get on with the business at hand so that we can enter the 21 st century confident and united .
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
later in Ottawa she was cofounder of the Tweedsmuir Centre , which pioneered the use of megavitamins in the treatment of mental and behavioural disorders .
Mr. John Cannis :
Ms. Bev Desjarlais
i wonder if the member opposite has any data on the results of final offer arbitration or arbitration awards generally .
it is going quite well across the country , including the Atlantic and the port of Vancouver .
it was a good amendment and we approved it .
it is a question of justice , a question of social justice and it means far more than just the social safety net .
and second , is he absolutely sure he is indeed the solicitor general ?
anyone currently receiving Canada pension plan benefits , be it retirement pensions , disability benefits , or survivor benefits , can rest assured that they will not see these benefits affected in any way .
three days before the federal election , we had a lively debate , and I feel I am once again at the Taverne Magnan .
we cannot wait until the day when Canadians finally decide they want to rewrite the Constitution to start setting the mechanism up .
allow me to wonder what the government ' s true intentions were , since it called an election before making good on that commitment .
i would also like to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on your recent appointment as our Deputy Speaker .
the CPP does not only include retirement .
do you know what the government is doing ?
i recently lead community consultation on job creation in my riding of Simcoe North .
hon. Jim Peterson
the words of hon. members are taken as hon. members , and I will deal with the situation as presented to me by hon. members .
right here in Ottawa , in Kanata , and in Cambridge we have been able to build a highly skilled , highly paid workforce that is producing value added products .
* * *
CRTC
Mr. Maurice Dumas
but do members think that the Canadian Chambers of Commerce is too partisan ?
this is exactly the image that comes to mind .
we are presently speaking with a number of groups and organizations throughout Canada , particularly as they represent seniors , to get their point of view .
the Caisse is also a prudent investor , active on all markets throughout the world .
even though I was a bit of a trouble maker at school - and I have kept a bit of it - my parents never lost their dream for me and my better behaved brothers and sisters .
i agree with the leader of the opposition that it is extremely important for Canadians that the integrity and the value of the Canadian passport not be jeopardized by the actions of other people , as was the case in Jordan last week .
the first point comes from the section in our document on the size of the surplus .
in other words , instead of being appointed by the prime minister they would be appointed by the premiers .
Ms. Val Meredith
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the private sector in this country does a good job .
reform members disagree with the fact that there has been $ 1.5 billion put back into the Canada health and social transfers .
does the Prime Minister think it is acceptable for Quebecers to be the only Canadians who will not be consulted on national unity ?
a strong message given to me in the last election , to do whatever I can to make sure the country stays united .
you may certainly conclude your remarks rapidly .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
no wonder Canadians were concerned and certainly worried about the plan .
how can the member claim to be serving ordinary Canadians when his party is being bribed by large corporations and banks to the tune of $ 40,000 in donations to the Liberal Party of Canada ?
i know that I am joined by the University of Toronto community , members of this House and indeed all Canadians in thanking the Davenports for this spectacular act of generosity .
we have our francophone brothers and sisters fighting an uphill battle to have their language , culture and heritage recognized as a distinctive element of our Canadian society .
the notion of living in safe communities is a hallmark of the Canadian identity .
due to our plan some 75 % of the reduction has been made on the financing side and only 25 % on the benefit side .
the hon. member for Abitibi is waving a piece of paper and he claims to be honest .
i ask that the Deputy Prime Minister explore ways in which that can be done .
they were penniless refugees who fled Uganda and the brutal regime of Idi Amin .
they are the people who have not benefited from the so - called economic recovery .
since I am a new member , I would like to take this opportunity to thank my constituents in Manicouagan .
i would suggest that this kind of logic ignores 130 years of the evolution of this House to the point that we are unique and not a twin or clone of Westminster .
try to take away that money in Ottawa , Mr. the hon. member for T 茅 miscamingue , and I promise you , you ' re going to get it .
is my friend from the Bloc in agreement with that ?
we might ask whether the President of the Treasury Board is the godfather of the government .
it was not an approach that took us to war .
request FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE
if nothing else , it is an opportunity to pause and assess the state of our society .
the University of Waterloo was started in 1957 , the same year that my family and I came to Canada and it has been a very important part of my life .
how is the corporation to be accountable ?
there seems to be a bit of a contradiction there in terms of how the approach is taken when it is an opposition party as opposed to a government party .
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to congratulate one of Kitchener - Waterloo ' s many technology based companies .
any future improvements will be fully funded .
there is nothing new .
i would like to focus on three areas which are of concern to me : youth , national unity , and investment in knowledge and creativity .
the country is functioning better .
but that in itself really is not the problem .
some hon. members :
separatist leaders will ask them if they want to retain their cultural identity or be swallowed up by an all encompassing federal government .
i also want to congratulate the hon. member from Parkdale - High Park for her eloquent speech as mover of the address in reply to the speech from the trone , and the hon. member from Beauce for his speech as seconder .
Mr. Eug 猫 ne Bellemare
it is really more likely to be an extremely faint hope .
Nobel Peace Prize winner Mother Teresa led a life that challenged the modern world by teaching us that lifestyle is not more important than life .
last week I met with representatives of the B.C. Community Fisheries Development Program who have helped over 3,000 fishers in recent months to find new jobs for victims of the Mifflin Plan .
Mr. Bill Blaikie
for my parents the grass was greener on the other side of the fence and education was the way their children could get into greener fields .
Mr. Stan Keyes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
to do otherwise , to let this country fail due to mean - spiritedness , intolerance and regionalism would be a crime against humanity .

ports CANADA POLICE
that is essentially what this act attempts to do .
as I knocked on doors and met people from all over the world , one of the things that was clear was that people in Thornhill are concerned about whether or not we will have in place in the future programs and plans like the Canada pension plan to protect them when they get sick and need disability insurance .
she is absolutely right .
the government has demonstrated unequivocally that they have not earned the right to make those decisions .
the Liberals talked of ethics , watch dogs and that sort of thing but it has never come to be .
will he recommit to this House today the contractual agreement that this government signed with the fishers of Atlantic Canada and Quebec to maintain the TAGS program until May 1999 ?
it is no wonder that young Canadians are becoming outraged by these proposed contribution rates .
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT
i declare the motion carried .
you have come here because you have been chosen to be the spokespersons for Canadians across the land .
that is exactly what would happen .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
Mr. Speaker , taxpayers have been taken for a sucker once more .
to the members on the opposite side I would like to take a few minutes to explain the riding of Palliser , which is in south central Saskatchewan . Palliser is a riding that is centred around the city of Moose Jaw and includes small towns , farm lands , ranches as well as the southwest quadrant of Regina .
i would ask all members to temper their remarks .
another thing I would like to do , and this is in reply to my colleague , is to ensure that we get our fair share of budget spending .
because I have such a large rural and urban riding , I think it is my responsibility and that of my staff to go out to the communities and speak to them on these issues .
two mechanisms are needed .
as I have frequently said to them , this seat in my judgment does not belong to me .
this is being done to ensure that our children will receive a pension under the CPP .
was there any consultation ?
Mr. Speaker , I know that we will help reduce the premiums for EI payments .
as the Leader of the Opposition said , we have her and her husband in our prayers .
land MINES
at the same time we would start to contribute a bit into the existing CPP because under successive Liberal and Tory governments it has run up a $ 560 billion liability .
as the member suggested , there would be a $ 500 billion deviation if we actually tried to fully fund that plan today .
we all had supporters among our volunteers and our loved ones .
unfortunately , the government chose the latter and missed the opportunity to offer Canadians real leadership .
i hope it is a sign of better times to come that there is some indication those security guards are now looking at a tentative agreement .
Mr. Speaker , in congratulating you and the other Speakers , I want to thank first the voters of Palliser for the confidence that they extended to me on June 2 .
i leave that to the House .
in an effort to cover up this deceit , these justice officials recognized the need to keep Ted Thompson from testifying when a motion for a stay of proceedings was entered on the basis of political interference into the judicial independence of the court .
are there many Canadians who wish to go back to where we have been on the whole question of national unity ?
i urge my hon. colleague , whom I had the pleasure to meet more often when we were sitting together on the environment committee , to try to raise awareness in cabinet and in the party to which he belongs , to make them more responsive to the demands of the working class .
it brings me to the point that we do not speak to each other .
to add insult to injury , at the same time these Liberals were heaping tax upon tax on the Canadian people , they were still pursuing their insatiable appetite for spending money in ridiculous and wasteful ways .
thank God we fought and won the election of 1988 and had the free trade agreement that allowed this country to increase merchandise export trade to the United States by 100 per cent .
where are the principles that will guide us on these issues ?
Mr. Randy White
there has been a big ratchet on this sort of obsession with the deficit and there has to be a dividend to look after the people in our community who are the most disadvantaged .
after that the changes to the marketing mandate of the Canadian Wheat Board could then be made through an order in council .
where is he dreaming at night ?
what kind of investment are we asking our young people to make ?
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Human Resources Development told me a few minutes ago , in answer to my question , that he had warned the RCMP of an investigation with respect to a Liberal Party fundraiser last spring .
the Speaker :
Mr. John Harvard :
accountability is to get a fair market price distributed to each farmer .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
presence IN GALLERY
first , will he tell us whether or not a search of his regional office in Montreal was carried out and , if so , how can he say there is no investigation going on ?
prior to the introduction of citizens initiative in Rossland in 1991 , four mayors had been tossed out of office in consecutive elections and councillors were being replaced all the time .
the result of this approach is that government selected information networks and broadcasters appear to be chosen more because of lobby efforts and who you know instead of the energy and innovation they bring to the marketplace .
you will see , in black and white , that the increase went to operating expenditures and capital expenditures and that it was used for severance packages given to employees laid off by the department and its agencies and not for the promotion of cultural endeavour .

i understood he was referring to the fact that our young people must be given opportunities in all parts of the country to reach their full potential .

where does this idea of visibility over effectiveness come from ?
if Mr. Coffey ' s evidence is not true then why is the minister and his staff trying to shut out and shut up Mr. Coffey ?
i declare the amendment defeated .
will the hon. member recognize , here in this House , that Quebecers are a people , that they have a right to self - determination , and that we can count on her , should tempers flare in the coming weeks , particularly in Montreal , to discuss the issue of partition ?
the problem with good initiatives , whether they be federal or provincial , is that there still is not enough money to take up the need .
Canadians will not have to ask the question " Will the Canada pension plan be there for me ? "
in addition to constituents , present at the ceremony was my father , age 94 , who resides in a retirement home here in Ottawa .
it is time to listen up , Mr. Prime Minister .
after the Clerk has unsealed the ballots , the Chair will suggest a method of proceeding which will help to accelerate the voting process .
that is job killing for the workers , but what about the small businessman , and the extra tax burden which the government does not want to call that , but it is a tax burden on small business .
throughout his career this approach was all too often dismissed as unsophisticated and old - fashioned but I believe he was ahead of his time .
it is possible that most of their time could be taken up on other business and Private Members ' Business would literally grind to a halt .
Mr. Speaker , I think the hon. member should produce a precise quote to show that any member of the Reform Party said that Conrad Black was overtaxed .
hon. Allan Rock
Mr. Speaker , I can indeed reassure the hon. member that our new crime prevention initiative is going to be driven by local communities all over this country .
the Speaker
just two weeks ago , the Governor of the Bank of Canada said " Canada is in better shape now than it has been for many years to face the economic challenges of the future '' .
in dollar terms an employee earning $ 35,800 a year now pays about $ 945 in annual contributions .
that is not democracy .
this increase only gets worse over time , and its coat tails will be long .
for their part , many groups and associations have endorsed the constitutional amendment requested by Quebec ' s National Assembly .
in the current system which is a balance of RRSPs , Canada pension plan , OAS and the supplement , there is a broader range of pension options available to people .
members who think like this are the ones who have not actually read the plan .
the government ' s ideological friend in Washington , President Bill Clinton , a Democrat , said last year that the era of big government is over .
Mr. Speaker , B.C. fishers have been more than patient .

that is a very regressive way to try to salvage the Canadian pension plan .
i come now to the motion before us .
the minister said that it was a provincial issue .
Mr. John Cannis ( Scarborough Centre , Lib . ) :
when the hon. member refers to us , francophones from outside Quebec , it is always in a negative way and I deplore that .
over 400 rescues a year are conducted and over 200 people are rescued in those endeavours .
we also set some very good objectives .
if we let down our part of that bargain we shall lose the support of Canadians for the publicly financed single payer medicare system .
usually the one left out of the partnership is the struggling entrepreneur whose tax dollars are paying for one who is allowed into the partnership .
the big concern - and I am glad to see the media is raising this as well - is that the government never set a base line anywhere in the document upon which it will determine its surpluses .
we can make it a noble time to build our nation or we can make it a destructive time .
where are the Reform and Liberal backbenchers to help us eliminate the immigration head tax ?
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
recently it was reported in the Globe and Mail that the good people of Alberta had been consulted on the proposed spending changes by the Klein government .
exactly .
* * *
i know that the government is in a very difficult situation because multinationals are always filling their slush fund .
and no need to say that the leader of the official opposition wants a massive decentralization .
these rates , moreover , help businesses to invest and to create jobs , which encourages purchases of major consumer goods .
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) :
agreed .
Mr. Bob Wood ( Nipissing , Lib . ) :
the builder of the hotel is Mr. Thibault .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien
Mr. Speaker , I have a question for the Minister of Finance .
it would be my intention to shorten the length of time for both the questions and the answers from what we had in the last Parliament so that , on average , we can have more questions .
does this demonstrate to us that students are coping in the institutions ?
we were expecting a national action plan , a plan that would set priorities and tell us how we would enter the new millennium .
the changes will ensure the plan ' s viability over the long term while making it fairer and more affordable for future generations of Canadians .
vacancy
we propose that , if a constitutional amendment proposed by a legislature does not satisfy these three tests , that legislature then be encouraged to make such changes in what it is proposing as would be required to meet those tests .
these entrepreneurs and risk takers employ hundreds if not thousands of Canadians and pay enormous amounts of taxes .
i would like to recognize in particular the work of the Canadian Teachers ' Federation , represented in our gallery by its president , Jan Eastman , its secretary general , Mr. Schryburt , and his deputy , Mr. Weiner .
madam Speaker , on a point of order .
for these five reasons , no doubt different from those of the Reform Party , I will nevertheless vote in favour of their motion .
the petitioners are concerned with the court decision in Ontario last year overturning a conviction of a women who went topless in public .
as has been mentioned a number of times in the House , Canadians have said where did that money go , where is it in the system .
health CARE
marriage ( PROHIBITED DEGREES ) ACT
Canadians also need to know that never again will their pension funds be mismanaged the way they have been in the past .
Kingston Pen was previously designated a multilevel institution dealing primarily with protective custody inmates .
the Reform plan would break the covenant that was laid down when workers first began to pay into the pension plan in 1966 by breaking the pledge made to those workers by previous governments that the Canada pension plan would be there for them when they retire .
i have no regrets about that , even though the people of the province may not have felt that way on the issue .
an hon. member :
can the minister advise the House what the government is going to do to stop this flow into Canada and to protect Canadians ?
it is an attack on the idea that government does have a role to play in investing in a stronger , more innovative economy , and it is an attack on the belief that government does have an obligation to help those in need and at risk .
Mr. John Williams
we have not yet been able to convince this government and instead of listening and responding to the needs of Canadians and to basic economic truths , it is going to ram Bill C - 2 through this House and continue to force Canadians to endure longer sustained high unemployment in this country .
basically what we have is a three part approach to restoring the financial sustainability of the CPP and ensuring its viability for future generations .
Mr. Peter Stoffer
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
unfortunately there was nothing in the throne speech to give hope to the elderly , the students , the sick , the unemployed and the small and medium businesses of Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac .
the minister has made a very prudent step in his move to open up the operations of the wheat board to control five producers .
following what appears to be the fraudulent use of Canadian passports by the Israeli secret services , we have learned that this has apparently been a common practice among the secret services of many countries for quite some time now .
i will listen closely to what he has to say .
and more than five members having risen :
that is simply not true .
having to take the drastic step of passing back to work legislation , which , by the way , some government members have already decided , and have said so in the newspapers , is the way to handle the postal strike which has not happened yet , will have a tremendous detrimental effect on the bargaining process .
in recent years the repositioning of Quebec ' s society has been modified by the contribution of newcomers at the same time as secularization has increased .
this is the least it can do after collecting an additional $ 23 billion since 1994 . Taxpayers are getting a little treat from the finance minister after years of tightening their belts .
being a member of Parliament is truly the greatest privilege and responsibility .
the CPP for some odd reason takes over the disability obligation of private disability insurance plans .
so , I would ask the hon. member , not knowing where he is coming from , whether he acknowledges that Canada has two peoples and , if so , how he can promote the French culture he has totally lost .
one out of every five people who built this country are living in poverty .
i have often felt that I am from a generation that has not done without .
the fund will grow in value from about two years of benefits currently to about four or five years of benefits .
we went through it .
that the Committee have the power to report from time to time , to send for persons , papers and records , and to print such papers and evidence as may be ordered by the Committee ;

Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
the member is speaking as if the government has just put the country into a big black hole .
one specific one that appears to have agreement from all attorneys general across the country is simply communicating for the purposes of obtaining sexual services in a public place .
hon. Lucienne Robillard
Mr. Speaker , my question is this and it is to the Prime Minister .
we have important new initiatives .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Monte Solberg
it says that Canada and a sovereign Quebec would be well advised to negotiate promptly a mutually beneficial agreement .
under the new policy the chief actuary considers the long term annual real return of about 3.8 percent to be realistic .
members
Mr. Jim Jones :
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the opportunity to reassure the member of my own strong feelings about these issues as well .
it also has in it the privatization of the administration of the plan .
just downloading onto the backs of the provinces , particularly the poorer provinces , is not going to solve the problem .
Mr. Nelson Riis
Sault Ste. Marie is a vibrant border city with a significant export economy .
we will not jeopardize the rewards that this progress is delivering and the achievements that we have made over the last number of years .
one has to ask did they get any flyer points for that .
i think that is what the government should be doing .
the hon. member for Charlesbourg , on debate .
there is an option .
the auditor general also states that the department has known about this problem for 10 years .
they have taken these forward for 30 years , in a linear way , and made projections which are very pessimistic .
if the Bloc and others are looking for the culprits , if there were culprits because I think there were legitimate positions on both sides and it is wrong to sort of demonize either side , it was other Quebeckers who were holding this position and who were telling people outside Quebec this was okay and had the support of the people of Quebec .

when the Caisse is involved in business financing , its purpose is not to take control of businesses or buy them outright .
all those in favour of the amendment will please say yea .
too many well educated young people are having a tough time finding that all - important first job .
Mr. John Maloney ( Erie - Lincoln , Lib . ) :
he has had to try to balance the books .
i believe that is a point of debate , not a point of privilege .
faced with an identical situation , since Quebec represents one quarter of the Canadian population , Quebec looked for an accommodation .
as I went from door to door , from community to community , from urban areas to rural areas I found , as I am sure many other candidates did , an immense degree of apathy and cynicism among both young and old alike , so much so that many had moved to the point of deciding that they were not going to vote at all .
as we move into the next millennium , profound changes will continue to take place in the economy .
i remind members of the House of words of the finance minister in his budget speech :
Mr. Speaker , the member can be assured that when the government puts together its policy toward the creation of a pharmacare plan we will do what is in the best interests of Canadians .
some $ 11 billion will be taken out of the Canadian economy over the next six years by the Liberal government for the purpose of trying to change and sustain CPP .
Ms. Elinor Caplan
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
hon. Charles Caccia
if government can evade the law and refuse to honour the finding of the Canadian Human Rights Commission , how can Canadians trust this government not to change the law , any law which it finds inconvenient ?
it wrenched out of the pockets of ordinary Canadians , Canadian businesses and Canadian investors over $ 25 billion in increased tax revenue .
the 1996 Department of Finance study by Marchildon , Sargent and Ruggeri classified CPP premiums as payroll taxes and found that " employer payroll taxes invariably lead to a rise in employer ' s labour costs in the short run and a reduction in employment '' .
i will have to somehow communicate that to the members opposite in another way because those are key questions .

Mr. Speaker , we are witnessing the federal government try to dole out federal money in order to buy students .

Mr. Speaker , the Reform Party critic should not perpetuate myths in this country .
the riding of Ahuntsic has a long Liberal tradition , and I take great pride in following in the steps of women like the Hon. Jeanne Sauv 茅 and Th 茅 r 猫 se Killens .
but the member nor anyone else on that side of the House ever mentions for a moment that they have just added over $ 100 billion to the national debt .
Mr. Speaker , it is something I have talked about and lived by for the last 34 years that I have been a member of Parliament .
i believe the programs that we have and will put in place will provide our citizens with the very best possibility to achieve their own individual successes in life .
the government had to take a position on this issue .
as to whether it is a question of privilege or not , my judgment is that it is not .
it will put the debt - to - GDP ratio on a permanent downward track .
today , everything is changed .

in short , for these reasons , the Bloc Quebecois will support the bill ' s being sent to committee , and we do not intend to make things difficult for the government .

Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for her comments .
then the minister for multiculturalism today in question period said how carefully she screens the grants to multiculturalism groups and how they never waste any money .
i refer members especially to the ruling of Speaker Fraser given on December 7 , 1991 , which can be found at page 4773 of the Debates .
my point is that with all these efforts to set up a pension plan for the future , it is also extremely important for the government , for all governments but especially the federal government , to control its own spending if we again go in the direction Liberal Party of Canada is asking us to go , in other words , start spending again .
in fact the government has the letter .

does the member for Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac share the point of view of her colleague , who just replied that the New Democratic Party had voted against the amendment proposed by the Bloc Quebecois - that the existence of the people of Quebec be recognized - and that it had nothing else to say , given the vote ?

his ministry has an important role to play in securing Canada ' s place as we move into the 21 st century .
Mr. Speaker , it is no great surprise to me that Ontario does not feel cheated by Confederation when it seems to control the country .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Calgary Southwest , Ref. ) :
the Speaker :
really , it is quite outrageous that the government treats this as if it were a business income to which it has a right for some sort of service that it provides .
this certainly has been an indication of the level of support the premier has had throughout his 10 years of office .
later on , I was told that I was a Quebecer and I like that better .
we should acknowledge the unique and important voice that the CBC provides to Canadian culture and Canadian life .
we want to devise targeted growth strategies that focus on knowledge intensive sectors .
the member conducted at least one interview via telephone with the media while on route to the meeting .

i congratulate the member for realizing the importance of possibly increasing some of our social spending in those areas .
we also need to improve the security and returns of registered retirement savings plans .

a mere cerebrally challenged farmer such as myself could figure that one out .
canada PENSION PLAN
while they agree with the principle of a public pension plan , they want people to prepare for retirement as early as they can .
as for the Canada social transfer , we read on page 58 of red book II : " A new Liberal government will raise the CHST cash floor to $ 12.5 billion beginning in 1998 - 99 '' .
Mr. Speaker , the Canadian nuclear industry ' s CANDU MOX proposal would involve the importation of up to 150 tonnes of weapons grade plutonium from Russia and the U.S.

the plan will be there for younger Canadians .
a society that invests in its children can look to the future with confidence .
madam Speaker , I will attempt to answer this question .
he will wipe out forever and a day the long held rights of these groups of people , people who have held those rights since 1949 and others who have held them since 1980 .
invariably when they do that they create jobs .
i think one part of it was the referendum process that these things would have to go through .
when the committee looks at the Canada pension plan bill it realizes that it has to look at some of the concerns that are being expressed here today .
then comes the matter of Canadian national interests , obviously a very political matter in the best sense of the word , what is good for the body politic .
it is a community with a long tradition of social activism and social commitment .

hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
during my tour there I had conversations with a lot of people .
we need to have payouts and contributions in line so that Canadians can have a plan beyond the year 2015 .
Mr. Speaker , perhaps the minister was listening to something else yesterday when the Prime Minister gave his own speech in reply to the Speech from the Throne .
the simple answer is yes , we did call for the elimination of the deficit and the reduction of the debt , not as an end in itself but as a means to an end .
but they are using the same methods , as we have seen in this case .
who does the hon. member think can spend the taxpayers ' money most wisely , the taxpayer or the government ?
we in the Bloc Quebecois will be on the watch .
all I can say is good luck .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
since 1984 the federal government accepted budget constraints and in turn made tough choices , choices that have led us to the other end of the deficit tunnel .
before I conclude my comments I would like to briefly mention what will happen if Quebecers opt to re - elect the Parti Quebecois , the separatists .
there was a referendum .
this letter is going to the Liberal national director stating that the election has been called and it is the time to start rallying Liberals across the country , to get the Liberal message out during the campaign .
i support Bill C - 2 , the legislation to amend the plan because that legislation will ensure that we have an improved and effective public pension plan that protects individuals in retirement .
there is all manner of tax evasion .
they consider the issues in depth and I have to convince them each time that I will work on their behalf .
premium increases also place a greater burden on the working poor which include women and young people .
i know that the RCMP in Vancouver have modern digital hand checks that they can do right away .
the F 茅 d 茅 ration said : " We must reject this treatment as second class citizens too long accorded us by governments '' .
i believe she was .
they will tell us far better than a bureaucrat or we sitting in this House .
i am also honoured and privileged to be the first member of Parliament of Latvian and Baltic States heritage to take a seat in the House of Commons , which in Latvian is stated as follows :
my question is for the Minister of National Revenue .
but no .
to sum up , I move :
in this government ' s rush to embrace technology as the wave of the future it has disregarded agricultural sustainability .
the Minister of Finance may not want to listen to me or my colleagues , but maybe he will listen to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce , the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and other organizations which agree that reducing employment insurance premiums by 60 cents for example would create 170,000 new jobs .
now there are 300 war criminals in this country and 38,000 refugees who came to our borders and entered this country illegally .
we read the papers and we see -
agreed .
justice
maybe it could do a better job .
it reminds me of last night when I left this hallowed Chamber and thought of the viciousness of their attack .
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Julian Reed
it wanted to maximize the payout while limiting the potential growth in the fund and its viability .
we know the RCMP is investigating the Liberal Party , but will the prime minister launch an independent inquiry into potential corruption in the government itself ?
we have seen what happened with Montfort Hospital .
Mrs. Francine Lalonde
what do we know so far ?
in 1902 a royal commission decided that Asians were " unfit for full citizenship - obnoxious to a free community and dangerous to the state '' .
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay
in 20 years there will be only four people working for every person who retires .
i would also like to pay tribute to the voters in the now defunct riding of Beaver River in northeastern Alberta , those people who took a chance and voted on the first ever Reformer in the House of Commons back in March 1989 .
i am proud to be a representative of that city and that province .
i listened with great interest to the hon. member ' s speech and I have two questions for her .
could he confirm , following all the questions he had in the House yesterday and the statements he made in the papers , that at no time and in no way did he discuss this matter since yesterday either with the RCMP , or -
another notion is that the government is there to protect no matter what .
Mr. Eug 猫 ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) :
that is why there should be a public debate .
everybody knows in this House that some of the reasons why the provinces had to make very drastic cuts in the last three or four years to health care and education are the reductions in transfer payments the federal Liberals gave to the provinces .
with respect to the problem of deciding what to do with the surplus , we did manage our spending very tightly and I am happy that the people of Canada supported the program of reduction in expenditures .
alongside this is the challenge of protecting our environment .
i think of an elderly woman whose husband died last year .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the President of the Treasury Board .
i did not feel that the entire 10 minutes had expired .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am proud to join Sikhs across Canada in celebrating the 100 th anniversary of the arrival of Sikh pioneers to Canada .
Paul MacPherson is president and general manager of Valcom , a growing and successful company in Guelph - Wellington .
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to offer a tribute to the member for Saint John .
after examining this government since 1993 , I would add to that list the youth of Canada .
it had a wonderful preamble which outlined how it would protect the rights of victims , how it would do this , that and the other thing .
that was part of our program .
our political history has shown that the true superiority of the parliamentary system can be fully appreciated through the diversity of views being represented .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member knows full well that the national airports policy is designed to turn the day - to - day operation of some airports over to local authorities .
i thought the government had understood the meaning of this principle when it passed its pay equity legislation , in 1977 .
that was after the consultation was held .
in 1995 prior to the last referendum the government was completely unwilling to challenge the legality of a unilateral secession .
social programs have been maintained and Canada has been judged by the United Nations , time and time again , to be the best country in the world .
allotted DAY - FEDERAL PARTY FINANCING
however , I am convinced that the member for T 茅 miscamingue could shed some light on the issue or could ask a more precise question .
in other words , backbench members of the government are putting on average two questions a day and the ministers are absolutely prepared in advance and actually reading from statements -
Mr. Speaker , yesterday in the House the Prime Minister said it would be unacceptable for foreign operatives to use the Canadian passport .
recent contributions have been made by Sue Palmer and Paul Shaw , two of Canada ' s Olympic athletes .
Mr. John McKay ( Scarborough East , Lib . ) :
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
the more I talk about the issue , the more I wonder .
because this subject is so important to the people of Quebec , I dearly wish that I could be making my principal points en fran 莽 ais .
the minister answered his third question by saying that the amendment did enjoy a reasonable degree of support from the people of Quebec .
the hon. member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough .
we will challenge the private sector to train young Canadians to take leadership roles in the new knowledge based society of the future .
they have become very cynical about politicians and the process of elections .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
* * *
as a result citizens can expect better decisions and more informed policy making from their leaders .
the position taken by DIAND officials was guided by restrictions of the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) :
our communities will never forget the francophone armed forces and reserve members from Quebec who fought alongside Mennonite families to save their homes .
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
it surprised a few on that side of the House .
i wonder if the hon. member would talk a bit more about those Conservative promises .
the mandatory Reform plan calls for higher increases in premiums , higher administrative costs and an additional private cost by Canadians to cover the private insurance for disability and death coverage .
the level of trust and agreement between people in the same profession is very high .
Canadians understand when we talk about aboriginal children and youth that the demographics of indigenous communities are such that the populations are growing at twice the rate of non - aboriginal communities .
whenever there is a war or a disaster in the world , there are Canadians among us who are hurting because of troubles in their former homeland .
this is as it should be and the better will be the chances of success for the conference and for our region .
everybody who reads their own briefing notes and papers that all members get would know that we compare quite favourably .
and we will continue to do so , regardless of the member .
statistics Canada showed us in 1992 that 6 percent of the debt is caused by government spending in Canada and only half of that is spending on social programs .
however , after I added new facts , which , I add , disagreeably surprised him , he changed his attitude to some extent and assured me that he would look into the matter and would get back to me about my concerns .
what I want to ask the hon. member is whether he admits that the federal government is about to get fully involved in areas under provincial jurisdiction .
we see Canadians connected to other Canadians .
he was not able to bring about a settlement .
there was a referendum .
hon. Jean J . Charest
i am so proud to be married to Peter O ' Brian who with his films such as Grey Fox and My American Cousin continues to find and produce films that tell our stories .
the Prime Minister and his government have been successful at meeting and surpassing their targets of deficit reduction .
the member ' s time for questions and comments has expired .
having been here for the past few days , having heard the Speech from the Throne , are we any further ahead today under this government , or is this government just more subtle about its practice of continuing inequality and discrimination in our society today ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
the impact on small business of the proposed payroll tax increases in Bill C - 2 will be considerable .
somehow he does not seem to understand that this investment board is going to reinvest it in the economy , in the open market .
i would like to give the mandatory congratulations to you , Mr. Speaker , on your appointment to the Chair .
how about starting on a policy , a movement for the purpose of building a good country , a country like Canada , the best country in the world to live in .
i shall do my best not to lower the standard of service to which Beryl accustomed them .
with the exception of two MPs , they were all turfed out of the House of Commons .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
it is very important for us to reflect on the human dimensions of this crisis on individuals and communities .
the Reform Party discussion paper Beyond a Balanced Budget provides a great deal of statistical information and arguments on why we must address the issues of tax burdens and entrepreneurship in Canada .
September 29 , 1997 - Mr.
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
it will pay for an individual ' s own benefits plus the unfunded liability .
statements BY MEMBERS
madam Speaker , I acknowledge that the constituents of Sydney - Victoria riding are a strong and resilient people .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
Mr. Larry McCormick
hon. Allan Rock
my question to the minister of fisheries is when is his government going to stand up for the interests of Canadian fishers in coastal communities ?
furthermore , there seems to be a lack of accountability of those dollars .
Mr. Speaker , today marks the seventh anniversary of the United Nations summit on children .
this is vital to ensure the quality of research and stop the brain drain .
i look forward to the support of my colleagues on this bill .
and more than five members having risen :
if a cap is introduced , Canadians can expect dramatic increases not only in gasoline and home heating fuel but also in electrical energy rates .
i have a two - part question for the member from Calgary .
it is trying to buy back your support with the fruits of your own labour .
QUEBEC PREMIER
Ms. Libby Davies
i was never a partner and I did not know anything about the relationship among any of the lawyers in the firm .
with respect to letting them suffer , that was a reference to the laissez - faire approach the Reform Party seems to be adhering to .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom :
on behalf of all of us may I thank many people across the country who participated in the political process , in the democratic process .
* * *
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment as deputy chairman of the committees of the whole House .
i am glad to see that today we have basically received its endorsement on the basic trajectory or direction that we are heading in .
i have not had the opportunity to do that yet , but I have started my education by studying some of his replies to throne speeches over the years .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
these people should know that they have been investigated , although they were not reviewed by a judge in the original warrant .
i would like to thank the voters of Battlefords - Lloydminster for their support .
hon. David M. Collenette
women will be hit hard by the proposed amendments .
there is an important point of debate here that Canadians are considering , which is the whole notion of transfers between different groups of people .
it will carry on with its strategy of instilling fear about what might happen following a yes victory in Quebec .
hon. Andy Scott
some hon. members :
Mrs. Jean Augustine
politicians were described to me as not really caring , being in it only for themselves or for the money , being dishonest or full of empty promises .
the Harris government is in the process of doing so and the Klein government has already introduced a referendum process for tax increases .
my colleagues , particularly the member for Crowfoot and others interested in criminal justice reform on the Reform side , will endeavour to remedy this deficiency in the government ' s legislative program by proposing reforms , particularly those that put the rights of victims ahead of anything else .
history has a funny way of repeating itself .
why can they not have some of the great benefits that this plan has brought to other countries ?
to help our listeners understand where the Bloc Quebecois ' support comes from , let us review a bit of history .
also because of pressure from the Reform Party , the public and the financial markets , we are on the brink of resolving the second of the four problems , deficit spending .
i will read him a brief passage from a letter I received from the Quebec minister , Louise Harel , as a result of a meeting with a youth advisory committee within the Soci 茅 t 茅 qu 茅 b 茅 coise de d 茅 veloppement de la main - d ' oeuvre , the SQDM :
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac , NDP ) :
bill C - 232 .
will the government commit to working with the provinces to make accessibility a new national standard for higher education ?
introduction and first reading
first , why does his department not comply with the will of our community ' s stakeholders to have public services grouped together in the downtown core of Saint - J 茅 r 么 me , as clearly stated in a resolution from the RCM of Rivi 猫 re - du - Nord on interim control ?
Mr. Speaker , I commend the hon. member on the government side for bringing the issue to the floor of the House .
you get some good home farm advice .
Mr. Speaker , that is what is called hardball .
the constituency that I represent cannot be compared to any other part of the country .
Mr. Speaker , millions of Canadians now make use of natural products and herbal homoeopathic remedies for their personal health needs .
Mr. Jim Hart
there should be legislation to prevent a government from increasing the deficit .
Mr. Speaker , I have travelled extensively and I know the value of the integrity of the Canadian passport .
let me mention what some of these would be .
speech FROM THE THRONE
in my own constituency , as an example , in the city of Chilliwack auto theft was up 87 percent last year alone .
my question to the hon. gentleman from the Reform Party is what is he going to do to help us in Atlantic Canada because of the fact that Atlantic Canadians did not even allow them in the door during this election .
DENTURISTS
why then is this government willing to throw away all the sacrifices made to eliminate the deficit ?
however , in the case of a section 745 hearing , at one point a judge said " life with no parole for 20 " but these families were forced to deal with it at 15 years .
he accuses me of incorrect facts .
no dollars will go into general revenue .
why ?
Mr. Speaker , first I would like to congratulate the hon. member for asking his first question in this House .
i guess it could be tabled if the hon. member had unanimous consent .
Mr. Alex Shepherd
i am sorry to interrupt the Right Hon. Prime Minister , but the hon. member for Temiscamingue has the floor .
as for the NDP , it has always ignored the Quebec issue , and in fact this is why Quebecers have always ignored the NDP .
the hon. member for Fraser Valley .
( the House adjourned at 6.59 p.m. )
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
( 7 ) to the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans
i am asking the solicitor general for an explanation of how the Prime Minister knew , the RCMP knew , his colleague the Minister of Human Resources Development knew , but he in his capacity as solicitor general did not know what the RCMP was doing , when he is the one responsible for it .
has the government planned ?
Mr. Jim Pankiw :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member should be very careful of the words that he uses .
the Reform Party is opposed to this legislation .
according to the hon. member , on September 16 he was invited to a meeting with the departmental official to receive a progress report on the Stony reserve , a reserve located in his riding .
i feel much the same way when a Reform member stands up .
routine PROCEEDINGS
i had three people who virtually worked full time for me .
if that is not political hyperbole to say it is a tax grab , I don ' t know what is .
second , the government suggests that we ask , is the proposed amendment a good thing for the citizens affected by it ?
this is welcome news indeed to a predominantly working class city like Sault Ste. Marie .
it is really a transition toward a partially vested plan .
if this government is willing to tackle the whole question of unity instead of focusing on the narrow agenda of those who would divide us then we will work with it for the shared goals of compassion , community and unity ; but that requires that this government do some serious rethinking and requires a new commitment to the real priorities of Canadians .
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
i do not wish to be dramatic .
we are doing a lot more in Newfoundland through the transfer payments as well .
will the minister commit today to giving back to the scientists the equipment he took away in July so that they can get on with the job of protecting Canada ' s food supply ?
we are big picture people .
some hon. members :
it was supposed to be a temporary measure which would be reversed once the war was over .
we want to make sure that the government listens to what Canadians have to say and make sure that Canadians are consulted .
the Speaker :
the fact that we are individuals gives us the ability to disagree with certain points and to agree with certain points .
in the three minutes that I see are remaining in this , my maiden speech , I want members present to be assured they can look forward to many more great speeches by me in this place over the next four years .
the chief actuary who has the responsibility of reviewing the Canada pension plan has clearly stated that we need to act now to ensure that the plan remains sustainable and affordable for future generations .
we have restored their optimism and renewed their hope for the future .

i ask all members of the House to join me this evening at the Rockcliffe airport from 6 to 8 to view the future of military aviation manufacturing in Canada .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
such negative support is harmful to our cause and we can easily do without it .
( 10 ) to the Standing Committee on Health
as well , they reflect the position of this government and its party , the same party which inaugurated health insurance some years ago .
that is how the Liberals got Canadians to buy into it in the 1960 s .
the Speaker :
i will continue to press the government to adopt stricter measures for the deportation of serious criminals who are not citizens of the country .
those were the three tests that the government proposed .
auditor GENERAL
will he now withdraw his court challenge of the Nanoose shutdown ?
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
the amendment will give the system a procedural option , something the police in my riding have been asking for .
the Speaker :
for example , we will enhance the voluntary sector ' s capacity to engage Canadians by improving their access to the technology they need to play a stronger role in Canadian life .
Mr. Speaker , I listened to what our socialist friend has said .
the Deputy Speaker :
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
it would be a huge cost .
the Conservatives had a chance to fix the system .
we have to accept in this House the comments from the opposition party on how it feels about our programs and our achievements .
could the minister tell us if this is just an effort to rub out her fingerprints on her interference in the CRTC process ?
in Calgary last summer he played an extremely important role in using his experience as the dean of the first ministers to develop a consensus that was very important for the future of Canada .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur
next Thursday shall be an allotted day .
this is the 11 th time I have been elected to Parliament .
it is my hope that Canadians will be forward - looking .
they have seen that a Liberal government has taken the country from a $ 42 billion deficit which was left by the Conservative Party to a deficit almost zero .
we have immigrant groups struggling for fair and equitable treatment under the immigration laws of our country .
some of those measures will be sponsored by ministers and set down for consideration under Government Orders .
Paul for their trust and confidence in me .
the standing orders have gone through an evolution since I have been here .
it takes vision and it takes a level of understanding and intelligence .
what happens when it is given to a provincial government that does not have the same spirit of generosity and caring as the federal government ?
the Government of Canada has certainly demonstrated that to us .
when we see laws passed and maintained that are punishing the innocent and creating inconveniences for the innocent , the law abiding tax paying Canadians , while at the same time giving special rights and privileges to the offender , there is something wrong with the picture and there is something wrong with the justice system in Canada .
hon. Paul Martin
poverty
in terms of the government ' s reaction to the circumstances that we found when we took office in 1993 , actions were taken .
the throne speech is about partnerships , partnerships with Canadian people .
but not this government .
i wonder if the member could comment on the New Zealand experience with its GST , or whatever it is called in New Zealand .
agreed .
the tax cutters over that same five year period increased their employment by 10.8 percent .
of course it is .
again , there is a consensus in Quebec ' s National Assembly , in fact , there is unanimity .
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅
why extend the location perimeter of the CEC ' s premises ?
we have the sadness which comes with losing a job maybe at the age of 40 or 50 years of age .
* * *
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
oh , oh .
their worry centred around the sustainability of the program and that it be available in the years to come .
our future as a country is too precious for us to risk losing it through misunderstanding .
speech FROM THE THRONE
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
we want Canadians to be involved in supporting political parties so that we are accountable to the taxpayers and not to the banks or the oil companies that now run the country .
i agree entirely that , in promoting the French language on the information highway , Quebec artists and technological firms will be at the forefront in creating content .
highways
if the hon. member would allow me to reply and not ask questions to his questions , perhaps he may share in the real facts and figures .
that is good because we know we are having trouble with some of our retirement programs as well .
[ English ]
* * *
however , All applicanats are required to submit a viable business plan to the CRTC .
we are moving into the next century , but the member wants to continue to talk about the misspending of the government .
hon. Allan Rock
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
perhaps the hon. member does not enjoy being first .
we have health care concerns and epidemics developing in a land where we have access to the latest scientific and medical knowledge .
Canadians are counting on us to continue our investment in higher education and skills development and to proceed with our investment in technological innovation through the proposed Canada foundation for innovation which John Polanyi endorsed totally in his remarks to the Nobel laureates on Sunday night .
but as I said earlier , those who forget the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them and that is Reform ' s tombstone in my view .
the minister will know that there are a number of cases which are before the courts , some of which have been appealed directly to cabinet .
if they did not have an insurance policy they would not have coverage .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
that did not just happen by accident .
the sad part of this is that despite all the taxes Canadians are paying , by the end of the century we will still only be getting about 68 percent in services for every dollar they send to this place .
the key thing is -
unfortunately both the announcement of his name and his riding on the television screen were wrong .
that is what is important .
however , because they were not done , our privilege of having our name in the draw was not there .
when Industry Canada made its first round of approvals for this program , 15 of the 271 winning bids across Canada were in Oxford County .
on behalf of all Canadians I would like to say to Mr. Egoyan that we are all extremely proud of what he has accomplished for Canadian films and for Canadians .
our plan for a partnership with the provinces would allow for stable funding and delivery and would mean that the federal government could never unilaterally cut health care spending again .
the current RCMP investigation puts that confidence in question .
it is a pervasive backdrop constantly present as we enter the 21 st century .
this practice goes against our history and against our vision of our country .
for 13 years this government has been evading the law , dragging its feet and wasting our tax dollars through tribunals , hearings and court challenges on pay equity .
i appeal to the government to please tell us what it is going to do for the people who are hurting like never before .
the northern portion of Barrie and Innisfil have not sent a Liberal member to Parliament since Duncan F . McCuaig , the father of our current mayor in Barrie , Janice Laking .
Mr. Speaker , I have three petitions to table today .
those are some concrete proposals aimed at putting more money back into Canadians ' pockets and at putting this country ' s affairs in order .
would you ask the member to be intellectually honest in the connections he makes ?
i share the perspective of the Reform Party with respect to the continuing inappropriateness of the role of Senate , not individual senators but of the Senate , in so far as its undemocratic nature is always a procedural contaminant in our proceedings here , especially when we are required to do things in the context of a special joint committee .
i consider this matter closed .
i would think they should be directed to those areas of Canada that have experienced particular difficulties , in the smaller communities and the more rural areas , the more remote areas and so on .
it is a mortgage on our children ' s future .
we have increased the number of our members in Quebec .
he wanted to share his numbers with us .
that is what he said .
the first was that they promised to destroy the marketing boards for the farmers .
my party , the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada , has developed a plan providing Canadians with a vision for the future that meets their aspirations and expectations , a simple , down to earth and unifying plan .
she stands in a very good tradition that I am well aware of having served in this House with a predecessor of hers , Rod Murphy , the member of Parliament for Churchill from 1979 to 1993 .
the government should admit this as a first step in removing the blinders and considering new and better alternatives to this defective plan .
we do not need the United Nations to tell us that , but we risk being complacent if we continue to pat ourselves on the back .
Mr. Speaker , some journalists and some members opposite claim I have treated French Canadians as second class citizens .
CAPE PROJECT

the minister distributed a summary of the report ' s recommendations to all farmers in western Canada and invited their feedback .
Mr. Speaker , there is quite a contrast here .

Mr. Norman Doyle ( St. John ' s East , PC ) :
if he does not have any new facts I will proceed from there .
as stated in our throne speech , the mandate before 2001 is to connect well over 5,000 rural communities across Canada to the Internet to help them to get information at home or at their business .
he replied that this Liberal government was not reducing the surplus intake because they want " to ensure that there will be enough revenue over a business cycle to pay the amounts authorized to be charged to the employment insurance account '' .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask my honourable Liberal colleague , who is also the minister responsible for financial institutions and who had a tear in his eye just now for the poor and the sick , which of these is the right answer : by the end of its mandate , the Liberal government will have cut either $ 42 billion from social programs , or $ 42 billion from social programs , or $ 42 billion from social programs ?
i have had representations from the member which I will look at .
madam Speaker , this is my maiden speech , so I respectfully request the co - operation of the members of the House of Commons , particularly members of my own party , to keep their heckling to a minimum .
we are trying to get this matter brought forward for debate .
they will be able to examine the prices at which grain is sold , the price premiums achieved , all operating costs and whether the CWB is truly efficient .
in other words , Parliament talks .
bill C - 220
Mr. Ken Epp
had you said to my father or anyone else at the time that buses would be running up and down in front of his front door , he would have questioned your sanity .
it is a privilege for me to work for the people of Charlesbourg .
the Reform Party strongly believes in majority opinion and majority rights as expressed and exercised through referendum .
Andr 茅 Tremblay , who was former premier Bourassa ' s adviser for several years , said there was too little in there to say it was not enough .
the Government of Quebec has developed such a set of tools over the past four years .
what are average Canadians going to do when they have to put out this extra money ?
most Canadians who have any understanding of the markets and the way they operate will know that this is an untenable position .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
i have to pay the liability for the guy skimming my grain .
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
i close with a statement made almost 130 years ago by Sir John A . Macdonald , one of the founders of this country .
our best long term protection results from their return to a law - abiding lifestyle in the community .
if it was at only 6 % , at age 65 that very same person would have a $ 275,000 nest egg and would have an annuity that would pay $ 26,000 until death .
we will offer it to people earlier and get it out of the hands of a government that has totally lost control of the plan .
the Speaker :
these two questions come to mind , given that the human resources minister said he informed those concerned .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise here for the first time .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
and more than five members having risen :
there has been no reduction in revenue to the provincial government as a result of harmonization of the GST .
madam Speaker , just like some members were saying , you would have to tie him up to get him to tell the truth .
it was that special Canadian family that lived in Scarborough , Saskatoon , Vancouver , Trois Rivieres and Charlottetown .

until we know the position of the Ontario government there will be no further negotiations .
it says clearly , in citation 493 , that :
such an undertaking would be doomed to failure .
the Deputy Speaker ( Mr. Milliken ) :
today , in tabling the resolution for a constitutional amendment to section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 , the Minister announced that it would be referred to a special joint committee that would report back to Parliament in the next few weeks .
if young Canadians were allowed to make a payroll contribution to a private investment vehicle and got a modest rate of return of 6 % a year , they would end up with an annuity of over $ 250,000 , producing an annual retirement income of nearly $ 24,000 a year , a far sight better than the measly $ 8,800 offered by the government .
they will have the money that they are now paying in taxes .
why is the Prime Minister lagging rather than leading public opinion on the national unity issue ?
it is a vision that inspires our government .
if there is a lesson in this , it is that this country continues to pay a price for failing to reform the upper house .
the promise of technology is astonishing but technology must have a soul .
Mr. Speaker , the federal government has decided to give public service executives bonuses totalling some $ 12.2 million , when close to $ 2 billion is owed to the 80,000 members of the Public Service Alliance of Canada , and when many Canadian families continue to live in poverty and unemployment .
we want to be absolutely certain of that because if we proceed on that assumption and the courts end up saying that no , we have applied the wrong section , we have done more damage than we have good .

my colleague the member for Palliser has outlined what changes have been made as a result of our interventions in the previous Parliament .
Mr. Speaker , let us just talk about that for a moment .
it is medieval and very good and very peaceful to listen to after a good question period .
that is right .
we suggested a reduction of about 30 cent per $ 100 .
it is fair to say that for a large number , in spite of the rhetoric and the promises that they hear , they are of the mind that there probably will not be a pension plan for them .

they have given me a responsibility to fight for things that matter most to people , the things that were missing in the Speech from the Throne , the most important issues that affect people on a day to day basis : the matter of jobs , the matter of quality health care , the matter of good public education , the matter of hope for our young people , the matter of security for working families and the matter of dignity for our seniors .

this Liberal government plans on doubling Canada pension plan premiums .
self - employed Canadians will be hard hit by this accelerated hike in premiums as they have to bear the burden of the combined employer - employee tax rate .
we will be insisting that public hearings be held across Canada before the government touches the Canada pension plan .
a great number of small businesses are suppliers that feed the large corporations that do trade .
of course , this reform will have far - reaching effects on the premiums paid by those contributing to the Canada pension plan .
with respect to all members of Parliament , I am not here to judge the quality of a question or the quality of an answer .
statements BY MEMBERS
if we look at the size of the debt , instead of going up one way on a graph as it did from the previous government , it has now gone another way .
another point is the new policy on Canada Pension Plan investments .
for example , the federal government organized an international conference on asbestos in Quebec City last month , which was attended by 300 people from 45 countries .
i would like to make one thing perfectly clear .
it goes to our commitment to building and working in partnerships as we confront the challenges facing us on a daily basis .
Mr. Speaker , is it a practice in the opposition to remark on the presence of another member in this House ?
there are so many more issues to raise and so little time .
presence IN THE GALLERY
i interpret it as a surprise overture coming from our friends across the way .
i think the private sector should be applauded for the progress it has made .
if I had to summarize the speech on government policy , I would say that the word is federalism in capital letters .

what does the member for Markham really consider to be a sacrifice ?
opening of Parliament
i should remind hon. members that it is contrary to the rules to refer to the absence of members from the Chamber .
quite clearly we have done a great deal of consultation and we are moving forward .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
this government had the opportunity in last week ' s Speech from the Throne to choose one of two paths : move forward to the future using the tools of tomorrow , low taxes , a government that encourages innovation and economic growth ; or move forward to the past using the tools of yesterday , high taxes , interventionist government .
instead it basically says " We will ignore this kind of situation and we will spend more over and above that . "
Mr. Tony Valeri
when we start talking about how to direct a tax reduction in a progressive taxation system , we have to take into consideration that the people who will benefit most are the very wealthy , which is why the Reform Party supports that group of people .
but to get a job when jobs are increasingly specialized , one must first get appropriate training .
under a new scheme , political parties will have part of their election expenses reimbursed also .

members of the opposition say that is why we have such a big problem in this country .
Mr. Richard Marceau :
because the federal government intends to continue with its reference to the Supreme Court .
reformers are afraid that Canadians are going to understand the degree to which they are going to let the Canadian citizenry fall .
Mr. Preston Manning
Mr. Prime Minister , are we there yet ?
i want to ask the hon. member if his method of representing his constituents will be to hold townhall meetings ?
the message here is that if one wants to build one ' s house , do we build a castle or get a refurbished house ?
there is also the business development bank which is providing start - up capital to new enterprises .
with their support solidly behind me , I rise today in the House of Commons to react strongly to the thinly veiled desire of the government across the way to put Quebecers back in their place .
the same taxpayer is paying taxes to two governments at the same time .
that was not fair .

it being 6.45 p.m. , this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .

it being almost 2 p.m. , we will now proceed to Statements by Members .
as we move into this exciting new chapter , I am honoured to be part of a government that has accepted the challenge `` to ensure that no Canadian is left behind as the country moves forward '' .
when the House leader opposite says this legislation is being pushed into committee , I can assure that is absolutely false .
member for Surrey Central
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration .
mother TERESA
by legislating balanced budgets , by holding the line on spending , by directing surplus to tax cuts , the debt will fall to 45 percent of GDP within 10 years as a result of the growth in the economy .
we have a crown corporation , the shares of which are held by the government , run by directors appointed by the federal government and acceptable to provincial governments , which will be managing up to $ 130 billion of investment capital within 10 years .

government SERVICES
i would like the member , who has been thoughtful on these issues for some time , to step aside from the rhetoric that he has brought into this House from his research department and sit down and itemize for me on the record the cuts that he would make in order to do it differently .
we need to go back to that and renew infrastructure to make it happen .
i wanted to know what farmers really thought .
our heritage values , strong family ties , community involvement and peaceful coexistence enrich Canada and its cultural mosaic .
the longer it sits in public the more it stinks .
clearly lower taxes mean both economic and employment growth .
now as we approach the other end of the deficit tunnel , this government chooses to continue to forgo jobs and tax jobs at a rate of $ 2.80 per $ 100 of insurable earnings , nearly 30 % higher than necessary .
Mr. Randy White
you have a few more seconds .
all those in favour of the amendment will please say yea .
federal DETENTION CENTRES
the only thing different is the name of the person speaking .
one of the minister ' s top customs officers has threatened to muzzle and fire this officer of the minister ' s department for making these allegations .
Canadians had no hesitation .
the Speaker :
i should also correct the reference in his question to the fact that it is the highest office perhaps that a lawyer can hold .
as well , the UN has decreed 1999 to be the international year for paying homage to seniors .
youth is a priority .
i am sorry that the hon. member from Quebec does not acknowledge that Quebec enjoys the money sent to it .
if Reform members say they want a real rate of return of 6 % , then a lot of pension plans would be doing very well with a real rate of return of 6 % .
that is why I encourage hon. members to vote against Bill C - 2 and to support a private mandatory retirement savings vehicle , a defined contribution plan which would give more retirement security at lower cost to my generation as well as to all Canadians .
perhaps he did not read his briefing notes .
committees must address their work processes and be very clear about how they expect draft reports and other material relating to in camera meetings to be treated .
Clair or Windsor - Walkerville as it was then , the Hon. Paul Martin , Sr . , the auto pact was signed .
i think if we had shown a little tolerance , a little respect for the people with whom we share a common border we might not be involved in the national unity debate in which we are involved today .
seniors tell us " The more things change , the more they stay the same '' .

Mr. Speaker , I will repeat at this time that there is a police investigation under way and we will wait to see what comes of it .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
we are seeing this kind of thinking coming back into the social responsibilities of business .
could the hon. member explain exactly how it is that one generation must show a leadership role for the next generation ?
we might also look at how various calculations are made .
the substance of this debate centers around adequate public debate about what should happen after a surplus has been created in the budget .
i invite all members of the House to give recognition to Canada ' s honourable radar veterans of the Royal Canadian Air Force .
Mr. Speaker , constituents of my riding are deeply concerned with the plaguing problem of street prostitution .

Mr. Gerry Byrne
at best one can reduce the amount that one is borrowing .

more than MP trained seals
i could understand that in 1994 after the election campaign of 1993 every time something would happen the Liberals would rise in the House of Commons to blame the previous government .
is this something that we actually want to do as members of Parliament ?
introduction and first reading
the minister ' s lawyers said that by contracting care givers to help her live at home she was running a business in her home and was therefore assessed nearly $ 5,000 in back payroll and CPP taxes and penalties .
when we look at government expenditures the problem is that we do not think about these two different factors : the difference between investments and consumption .
people also need our help .
i see that as a priority this time and it is a priority in the Speech from the Throne to do that .
i am confident that you will assume your responsibility with great skill , integrity and competence as you have shown so far in your time in the House .
that is a fantastic way to live in this old world .

through the Medical Research Council we are seeing to it that peer review awards are made available for those who have inquiring minds and who are looking for the treatments , the cures and the technologies of tomorrow .
Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) :
legislative Counsel
i rise on a point of order , Madam Speaker .
one of the best ways to achieve its goal is to substitute markets for those public programs now authorized through democratic institutions .
that right will be wiped out by parliament in association with the house of assembly of Newfoundland .
one of the other things the Liberals propose in these amendments is to create a publicly managed investment fund of over $ 200 billion .
many parents feel their rights and responsibilities are threatened by the government ' s attempts to fully implement the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , a UN charter which has never been approved in this Parliament .

Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Jerry Pickard :
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
will the prime minister assure us today that Canadians will have their say ?
some hon. members :
the topping up of the money by the Canadian taxpayer in this particular instance is the question .
the government congratulated itself on what it sees somehow as a brilliant record .
if they want to talk principles , that is what we will do .
since that time Canadians of all ages have benefited from improved quality of life and health care that denturists provide .
No.
if we as members of Parliament think that by increasing premiums to individuals and businesses to the tune of $ 700 annually will not have a major detrimental impact on a lot of the local communities in the country , we are dreaming in Technicolor .
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Ken Epp
the Deputy Speaker
the minister decided that farmers should vote on whether they wished to continue to market export barley through the wheat board .
we have one of the youngest communities , myself and the hon. member for Whitby - Ajax who I am very pleased to say has done a spectacular job as a member of Parliament and previously as a councillor .
it should be noted that since my leader ' s application for a special debate , a third bill has appeared on the Senate order paper today .
it is a community filled with hard working , straight ahead people who are proud of their contributions to Canadian society .
Mr. Scott Brison
i hope that was the purpose of the hon. member ' s questions .
does the government have a view on what is the optimal size of government , on what is the optimal revenue that it should be taking out of the economy ?
Mr. Speaker , the premiers will use the means they deem appropriate to consult the public about the seven principles set out in the Calgary declaration , which the government of Canada fully supports .
only an inquiry will be able to find solutions to the crisis not only on the east coast but on the west coast as well .
with all the changes introduced by the Minister of Human Resources Development , what used to be unemployment insurance has now become poverty insurance .
this Forum cost $ 12 million at the very least .
Mr. Speaker , with respect to the preamble of the hon. member ' s question , in my view an inquiry would serve very little in terms of advancing the interests of fishermen on either coast .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed . )
between 5,000 and 8,000 jobs are created by every additional billion dollars that Canadians export in goods and services .
back then huge government advertising contracts went to a company run by Dalton Camp and Hugh Segal .

these changes will restore the CPP sustainability and make it more fair and affordable for all future generations .
Mr. Egoyan , would you please stand and be recognized .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
two years ago when the government decided it would create a new $ 2 coin , there were consultations to decide what would go on the coin .
Mr. Speaker , an investigation is under way at the present time , as everyone knows .
they have a choice with whom they even contract it to .
public WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES
Mr. Speaker , with due respect to the hon. member , on Charlottetown people were consulted .
what does Bill C - 2 do ?
Mrs. Nancy Karetak - Lindell ( Nunavut , Lib . ) :
in fact , Quebec could be a role model for second language teaching .
how long did we debate this motion ?
now we are at a point in time where the government has to jump up these premiums for the Canadian public on a system that should have been well financed and well - heeled forever .
as much as the Canadian Wheat Board is a monopoly , so is the rail system a monopoly .
absolutely no criteria have been established on how those decisions are going to be made .
for example , the government has just appointed Mr. Justice Michel Bastarache , a colleague of the Prime Minister , the former chairman of the yes committee in the 1992 referendum on the Charlottetown accord and a great friend of this country ' s federalists .
the radar network saved countless lives and helped ensure victory for the Allies .

if people are taken out of the workforce through no fault of their own , either as a result of disease or an accident , and cannot provide for their family , will we as serious , caring , compassionate people make it tougher for them to qualify under the Canada pension disability program ?
Mr. Speaker , I certainly do not want to defend the Liberal Party on its proposals for reforming the CPP .
with regard to the firm RAMCO d 茅 veloppement Inc. , its president , Mr. Jacob A . Attias , is rightly surprised and mostly quite shocked by he lack of transparency of the Liberal government ' s process in the matter of moving the CEC out of its present location .
this summer the new justice minister said the YOA would be a priority yet we did not see anything in the throne speech about it .
Mr. Speaker , the government shares the concern of the hon. Leader of the Opposition about the reputation of Canada and Canadian difficulties .
if Quebeckers recognize that they are not the only Canadians who reject the status quo and opt instead to elect a provincial government that is committed to renewing and revitalizing the federation , then Canada will undoubtedly enter another round of constitutional negotiations .
their little pet had grown into a $ 57 billion monster .
the Bloc Quebecois will never stop calling for the federal government to stop useless and unwarranted spending for propaganda purposes .
when reports are made by my department , this proves there is a strong interest in these questions and that in the department -
i present this petition on behalf of my constituents .

that is regrettable .
as for the more controversial aspect of including secession in these renegotiations , 700 respondents said yes , it should be there .
Mr. Speaker , my question concerns the safety of Montreal ' s airports .
it is the machinery of government we must scrutinize .

partnerships work .
Mr. Tony Valeri :
this government has not told this House anything concrete about this issue .
after repeating this message for months and after it was almost unanimously criticized by Quebec , the Prime Minister has come back again , with the same centralist message , this time in writing , saying he thinks he knows what is best for Quebec .
the federal - provincial CPP agreement of February 1977 does specify a couple of further parameters for the new investment policy .
madam Speaker , I am pleased to speak to Bill C - 2 on the reform of the CPP .
those receipts are issued by our respective financial agents .
for example the government has demonstrated its commitment by increasing its contribution to the Canada child tax benefit by $ 850 million a year , with higher payments to families beginning July 1 , 1998 . We need to do more .
i can report to the House that over the summer considerable progress was made , for example , in partnership with provincial ministers and with the advice of consumer groups toward the creation of a new national blood agency , an agency that will be put in place in keeping with principles of accountability and safety , learning from the tragic lessons of the past and based on a format designed for the future .
search AND RESCUE HELICOPTERS
the Government will build on this success with a focussed strategy , developed in consultation with industry , to improve our international economic performance by expanding Canada ' s trade base , becoming the location of choice for global investment , and making Canada a preferred tourist destination .
it is not known when it will actually be up and running .
medicare is uniquely Canadian and very worthy of our support and attention .
we have seen it with the moves in the transportation industry .
Mr. Paul Forseth
in the spirit of the upcoming small business week , I urge this government to pursue policies that would lower taxes and deregulate the economy .
canada MARINE ACT
colleagues , before we begin with orders of the day , I have received notification from the hon. member for Burnaby - Douglas .
it kept parties honest and the Conservative government and employers had a problem with that .
i think it is time for a remedial math course .
that is why the prime minister will lead Team Canada on trade missions , including one to Latin America in January 1998 . The four missions to date have resulted in more than $ 20 billion for Canadian businesses and thousands of new jobs for Canadians .
i wish to ask this question of the Minister of Finance .
some believe that , without inequalities enshrined in the Constitution , Quebec will never be an important component of Canada .
but when all four Halifax area federal ridings elected New Democrats to represent them in this session of Parliament , I knew that Halifax was a bell - wether riding .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
the House resumed at 12.44 p.m.
yet it is determined to ram the legislation through .
i know that because they just have to take a look at my grey hair .
i am honoured to be here to share my views and to speak on behalf of the people of Winnipeg Centre .
customs
madam Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to challenge the flawed reasoning by my opponents across the way and to demonstrate why our efforts to reform the Canada pension plan are far superior to any of the opposition plans and are much preferred to doing nothing .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister .
however , we have a number of concerns that I will address shortly .
* * *
one day we even heard from the Secretary of State for Latin American and Africa , a mistake only remedied when the government finally realized that neither Israel nor Jordan are in Latin America or Africa .
our greatest responsibility is to build a new spirit of sharing and mutual respect for a new century .
suspension OF SITTING
a person by the name of Thibault who lives in the riding told the press that he never heard about a company called Videon .
this is the kind of initiative that I think is consistent with his comments and which serves to strengthen our nation and celebrate our Canadian citizenship .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano
it is a reflection of what Canada is all about .
this has to be addressed by the committee .
hon. Don Boudria

the social union is an essential feature of Canada .

Mr. Bill Blaikie
a small number of producers would like to see the board abandoned completely now , but a substantial majority of producers , and not 50 plus 1 , want exactly the kind of changes the minister is proposing .
i asked her how and why she came to Canada .
we have been very specific on this issue and every other issue .
his words are fitting when applied to the national unity debate .
i would like to take a moment to summarize what I think the government ' s position is .
one day of debate .
parliament
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) :
i know of people , for example , among my own relatives and certainly in my own riding which has a higher percentage of seniors than any other riding in Calgary for whom CPP and the old age security is their principal source of income .
he brought me two publications that were co - authored by Stanley and by my father who came to work in Ottawa as the first researcher for the CCF caucus in the early 1940 s .
in fact , if we look at the throne speech , we realize that it not only denies that there is any difference , but also that it denies the existence of a distinct society , a distinct culture and , more importantly , the existence of a distinct people .
when I look at the program of the Leader of the Opposition , he promised to put $ 4 billion more into health care .
we can continue to do what we have done .
culturally it is predominantly English , Ukrainian , French and aboriginal .
the House has heard the terms of the motion .
this is the improper obstruction .
after having served five years he was paroled in 1992 .
the CEC has always been located in Saint - J 茅 r 么 me ' s downtown core .
to privatize its infrastructures and transfer them to provincial or regional authorities so as to avoid running a deficit .
a vote will be held , but it will not be by show of hands , since some people can then move quickly and vote two or three times .
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua ( Vaughan - King - Aurora , Lib . ) :
this is another reason to support the striking of a parliamentary committee .
he is not responding to the very real needs of producers .
let me ask him how in the world he is able to plead ignorance on more of these shenanigans in Shawinigan .
more tentative are such traditional features as respect for the rights of the minority , which precludes a government from using to excess the extensive powers that it has to limit debate or to proceed in what the public and the opposition might interpret as unorthodox ways .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
when there is a debate I hope they will consult with the people .
it is very important for us to discuss it .
i call on all members at this point in time to support this initiative for the benefit of all Canadians .
it was established in 1966 , and nine provinces joined , Quebec having its own retirement pension plan , the Quebec pension plan , commonly known as the QPP , which , incidentally , is also under review .
they are laughing at over a million children waking up this morning and living in poverty in the richest country in the world .
before anyone decides to heap any praise on the Liberal Party for this predicted balanced budget it is important to clearly identify the reasons why this balanced budget may be occurring .
that is public knowledge .
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
i presume it is on this same matter .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
and we were told that , when a general survey is mailed out , for every person that answers , there are between 75 and 119 , if memory serves , who read the document , and who are interested in replying , but who are afraid to , or do not have the time or the guts to do so .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
there are fewer police on the streets , fewer teachers in the classrooms and fewer nurses in the hospitals but there are a whole lot more people being pensioned off who still want to be working and contributing to their communities .
supreme COURT OF CANADA
it means that empty ships are waiting in Vancouver harbour and full train cars are sitting in the port of Vancouver but with the wrong product .
on Monday of this week the company was awarded the 1997 Canada Export Award by the Minister for International Trade at a ceremony in Quebec City .
they never used the processes that were put in place .
some hon. members :
it is unfortunate that this sad reality is only brought home to us during electoral periods .
in my opinion the yeas have it .
if my colleagues want to say some positive things about the Speech from the Throne , about the prime minister or about my colleagues on this side of the House , we will not ask them to sit down because they happen to be in the opposition .
justice
that is not a route that should be taken .
government ORDERS
while we may disagree on the process we all want to effect change that will improve the lives of all Canadians .
in fairness to the other members who are on the list to speak , I think it might be more prudent to continue with the debate .
Mr. Speaker , the member should get his facts straight .
the hard work of the Air Base Property Corporation using Industry Canada and National Defence adjustment funds has paid off .
the board ' s great strength and its success are based on its practice of buying grain from farmers at an initial price , marketing it as a single desk seller and distributing any surplus earnings equitably as final payments .
that is a healthy thing among maritimers , I am sure .
Mr. Speaker , I am both honoured and proud at having been chosen by the people of Bras d ' Or to be their voice in Ottawa .
the member suggests they were supplied .
the rest of my speech has to do with the accountability , a term MPs opposite seem to like to throw around , of what has been said in debate by the opposition parties , chiefly the Leader of the Opposition .
we are used to hearing fine speeches , and very emotional ones too , from the hon. member for Edmonton North .
Mr. Guy St - Julien
we will secure the future of our young people .
the CPP is a pay as you go pension scheme , and was not even properly funded to begin with .
where is a non - constitutional Senate reform amendment , at least to make the place elected ?
in the disability portion of the plan we have some 300,000 Canadians in other provinces along with another 50,000 people in the province of Quebec .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
now the federal government wants to repeal this directive , thereby making the administration of the plan much stricter .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
yet members are in fact being impeded in performing their parliamentary work .
they are much more far reaching and broad than saying that the federal government has this and this to do .
Mr. Paul Bonwick
some hon. members :
Mr. Jerry Pickard :
that is the real story .
on this earth there is no insurance of longevity , only the belief , the faith that what we have contributed in our lifetime can be an assurance of a future .
we must all move forward together .
the Speech from the Throne has renewed the government ' s commitment to youth as a main priority for the second mandate .
i will go no further with this , but I would like to address the question of minority rights .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe :
Mr. Grant Hill
order , please .
Mr. Gary Lunn
these interest charges mount by $ 5.3 million an hour and chew up $ 1 in every $ 3 in budgetary revenues .
we formed Canada , we built it , and I am asking you to be part of it .
i welcome the debate because it is very important to question what is a fair level of total debt .
how could anybody believe that the Liberal government made such an omission because it cares so much about the ethics guidelines .
the ages for retirement will remain unchanged , despite the fact that there were rumours of the retirement age rising two , three , four or five years .
with respect to the harmonization of the GST , Quebec has benefited from that .
hon. Jim Peterson :
in his submission , the hon. member for Wild Rose claimed that an official of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs had deliberately misled him and subsequently denied him information .
the Speaker :
this will give them a better chance .
Mr. Daniel Turp
can the minister tell these Canadians and any Canadians travelling internationally what he is doing to prevent this -
hon. Paul Martin
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) :
as a rookie councillor in 1991 , I often turned to Tom for guidance and advice .
what about the question of generational equity ?
i did raise the matter of what precedence this may set for other provinces .
if the fisheries critic of the official opposition knew something about the problem of the Pacific salmon treaty , he would know that it began because the Alaskans overfished Canadian bound sockeye salmon in northern British Columbia going to the Nass and Skeena Rivers , to the tune of three times what they had done previously under the treaty .
that the House do now adjourn .
this fund would be a tangible way to honour their courageous service and to assist their loved ones in their time of need .
people in our communities and schools are ready , willing and able to assist to ensure that nutrition programs are in place for all Canadian schools that need one .
there have been developments in agricultural technology that he could not possibly have foreseen .
the delivery of the Canada Health Act is vital .
Canadians are concerned by what they see happening .
i would like to thank the member for his speech and his invitation to serenity .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
generally speaking we have , you and I , three basic rights and privileges .
we have many problems right now . Housing is one of them .
Mr. Speaker , Quebecers are upset by the attitude of the separatists .
this national multimedia conference has attracted 200 delegates in addition to hundreds more participants at 11 provincial and territorial sites via the Internet .
CANDU MOX
the government has not even taken the trouble to " feminize " the text .
No. He can sit there and be eligible for over $ 4 million in pension and talk about the public who will have to try and live on between $ 8,000 and $ 9,000 .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
if we cannot have a bill in the draw or it is in there but it has not been drafted because there is not enough bodies to draft it , there is a problem with the system .
madam Speaker , it is true that we must distinguish the two .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the subamendment ?
it is a pleasure and an honour to be here in the House of Commons .
they are concerns we would like to explore at the committee stage .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
this is a government that could have sent the signal that it has learned something about the last 30 years .
* * *
* * *
another possibility , and this is becoming downright dangerous , is that the Solicitor General has lost control of his responsibilities , which include the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the RCMP , which , coincidentally , has been in the headlines of late .
Mr. Speaker , the Canada Labour Code has worked well for both management and labour in this country over the years .
we grieved not only for the loss of someone filled with so much promise , but also for someone in whom we saw ourselves .
i do not believe that the government understands what it has done .
i want to talk a bit about another key theme that I suspect might have been discussed by the Reform Party : expanding opportunities in aboriginal communities .
thus our ministers have agreed that the CPP funds will be invested in a diversified portfolio of securities in the best interests of contributors and beneficiaries , much like private sector plans .
they look at the changes they have made for example to their social assistance programs that have reduced the dependency and focused on building trampolines so that Canadians can be partners and participate in the economy .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
there are so many observations that refute this theory .
once again , I say " Thank goodness Quebec was able to acquire , in 1965 , this tool which made it possible , despite other hostile factors , to bring about significant development of Quebec '' .
there is not a nickel deposit every few miles but we have to understand that is where the solutions are for Atlantic Canada .
these amendments are the result of a long and wide ranging process of consultation that began in our last term of office .
canada is relying more on reservists to meet its military commitments .
madam Speaker , the difficulties of the province of Quebec , and of the other provinces as well , arise mainly from the fact that it has a revenue shortfall in what it was receiving from the federal government in the form of what were called transfer payments .
i will go to the second question .
in case the member has not noticed , there have been two election campaigns that have brought Liberal governments to majority .
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) :
canada PENSION PLAN
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) :
we are not only fixing today ' s problem .
but most important , I am aware of the need to preserve the integrity of the position of the solicitor general .
i want to be fair .
parliament OF CANADA ACT
i welcome the very constructive approach that the leaders of the Reform Party , the New Democratic Party and the Conservative Party are taking on this issue .
it is after all the reason we have a federal government .
when we see things like what we saw on last night ' s news - this morning , when I called my riding office , they reported a number of constituents ' calls still coming in , along the lines of " Is that what is happening in our fine riding of Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , as it is in Drummond and Trois - Rivi 猫 res , where Liberal fundraisers are forcing company CEOs to pay up $ 10,000 or $ 20,000 if they want any recognition ? "
this government had an opportunity with health care to demonstrate that it really believed in partnership instead of acting unilaterally .
it is high time that you put your own interests aside to talk about those of all Quebeckers .
Mr. Speaker , the Calgary declaration was very well received in Quebec .
Mr. Speaker , in attempting to use the best technology possible and at the same time achieve a system which is economical to the Canadian taxpayer , changes have been made to the radio system in the Gulf of St. Lawrence .
i appreciate the comments that have been made but I wanted to raise a question about the throne speech opening up a pathway to prosperity .
they have embarrassed our country at home and on the world stage in their handling of the matter .
the longer you delay , the worse it gets .
on every occasion that we have risen in this House , we have made the connection between the bill now before us and certain objectives that our party has .
the speech goes on to say " The government will continue to be vigilant and responsible about keeping the financial affairs of the country in order '' .
integrity in political life must come first .
it is simply remarkable and it says a great deal about the health policy of the Reform Party that in this day and age , with the complexity of the issues we face and the challenges we face as a country in preserving and strengthening health care , the hon. member has to take his turn in the House of Commons to ask a question like that .
these are priorities we have stated clearly and strongly .
third , by finding out how the delivery , organization and funding of home care can be improved and , finally , by exploring various formulas for financial support and a potential drug plan .
a motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved
why does the government accept that , when an accident occurs in the workplace , the CPP provides benefits for the injured worker , instead of the workers compensation board ?
the jobs of the future will increasingly be knowledge based jobs and our ability as a nation to foster a culture of innovation through research , development and entrepreneurship will determine our future economic growth .
it says we must begin by mutually recognizing the existence of each other .
i ask the member what she said in the campaign .
war CRIMINALS
to these two main priorities I must add a third one , without which implementation of the other would be impossible .
routine PROCEEDINGS
as Canadians we want our children to enjoy all the opportunities that Canada has to offer both in childhood and as they grow into adults .
snowmobile SAFETY
Mr. Speaker , I do think it is somewhat premature to speculate about using quasi - judicial review bodies or agencies when we have not established the facts .
the Speaker :
i want to put on the record that we strongly support single desk marketing in this country .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
i am happy to have her here .
we have the right to come to this place .
through programs like SchoolNet , Technology Partnerships Canada and the Canadian Foundation for Innovation we are making tremendous progress .
i am sure that you bring expertise and fairness to the position .
Tuesday , October 7 , 1997
although I did not raise that issue , I certainly agree with him that we want to restore confidence in our youth .
Mr. Speaker , we will get to that , actually .
Mr. Speaker , again the member may not have heard my earlier comments before question period .
i cannot believe that a member on the other side of the House would find the youth of today not to be one of those economic and social priorities .
our industrial components had their very foundations shaken , some even destroyed , throughout the mid to late eighties and early nineties .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
* * *
perhaps we can come back to this next time .
all those opposed will please say nay .
i know the leader of his party does not really accept the general premise that their membership may want at an assembly .
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron
there was some interest in health corporations and privatizing the system so they could make some money out of it , but never the kind of question that was raised by the member from Vancouver East about what happens when thousands of people are sick or dying .
Canadians are entitled to know and feel that their communities are as safe , as peaceful and as secure as we can make them .
it contains people from all walks of life and from all backgrounds .
third , they said that it has to be fair across the generations and between men and women .
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me in my capacity as Minister of Health to address the House in the course of the debate on the Speech from the Throne .
i must say I never really quite believed that until the June 2 election .
it is however substantially lower than the 13 % increase that would arise from the alternative plan .
we are committed to reducing the debt to GDP ratio .
this is an opposition amendment to the speech from the throne moved by the Leader of the Opposition .
i have heard the Liberals across the way talking about the fact that we do not have any representatives in Ontario .
as one of my colleagues pointed out earlier , Mr. Mass 茅 made a statement to that effect .
this 36 th sitting of the House
where is the bill to get that ?
i had the opportunity of sitting with one of his colleagues who contributed to that discussion quite effectively .
second , does the hon. member think this only happens in the province of Quebec or does this happen in the other provinces ?
a new American law requiring Canadians crossing into the United States to undergo a lengthy and invasive inspection process could have disastrous effects on Sault Ste. Marie tourism and the normal flow of business between our city and its American neighbours .
at the Federal Office of Regional Development in Quebec the elimination of workers actually led to an increase in employment .
were you seeking unanimous consent ?
for some time now , Quebec society has been secularized and has become considerably diversified through the contribution of newcomers .
we have made an offer of $ 1,3 billion and we intend to leave this offer on the table , and when the unions are ready to negotiate , they have only to come back .
what about the ordinary citizens ?
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the President of the Treasury Board .
thousands of visitors come every year to enjoy the natural beauty of northern Ontario .
they did not feel it .
that fraction is growing smaller and smaller all the time because of the bills they are putting before the House such as the bill which revises the wheat board .
so let us recognize what the government is doing here .
the department has not seen them yet .
i want to let them know back home that I will do the very best job I can to represent them in this House .
congratulations , Mr. Speaker .
but the year 2000 will come and we will do it together in a stronger fashion .
where does he live ?
all of us want prompt , caring medical help when illness or accidents strike .
Mr. Speaker , members of the House will know that the CRTC is a separate body at arm ' s length from the government .
Mr. Speaker , I very much enjoyed the debate that was going on in the last couple of hours .
the Liberal government ' s strong commitment to fiscal responsibility as articulated in successive budgets , the red book and the throne speech has provided a stable political and a strong economic environment to allow these businesses to rebuild and strengthen their positions in Canada and in world markets .
Mr. Speaker , our employment insurance reform came into effect a year ago .
i also believe , along with government , that the individual members of society have a role to play in ensuring that we have a safe country in which to live .

this would reduce default problems and therefore increase the likelihood and dollar value ceilings on private sector student loans .
if it is good for everybody else , why would it be bad for Quebecers ?
so , let us rejoice at the Quebec National Assembly ' s unanimous stance on the establishment of linguistic school boards .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
this morning the hon. minister of Indian affairs will be making a statement , giving us further information on this question of privilege .
today the 5.85 % legislated CPP contribution rate is shared equally between employees and employers .
it would also result in an increased sense of producer ownership of their marketing organization .
we have some further comments to make on the committee and the process it would employ .
as parliamentarians let us restore the lost public confidence in our political parties and the democratic process .
i would like to clarify one thing that I said .
we have come a long , hard way , but the end is in sight .
why will the minister not admit that the real reason he will not consult is that he is not sure he will get the answer he wants ?
the hon. member for Macleod .
the hon. member for Wild Rose argued that the actions taken by the official from the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs constitute a contempt of Parliament .
the cuts to unemployment insurance , the cuts to social assistance imposed on the provinces and the reductions in health and education transfers occasioned by this government ' s deficit reduction have wreaked havoc in the lives of thousands of Canadians .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
the issue we have before is a very important one .
all members know that medicare represents an extraordinary Canadian achievement .
while you may get the odd desk thump or applause from me , I pray that I will never sink to the point of being discourteous when others are speaking .
on behalf of the Government of Canada I would like to offer our sincere condolences to the Ellis family .
they did it in the face of the opposition of a particular government in Quebec at that time , but they had no reason to believe that there was anything in the way of unanimity in Quebec in opposition to that package because they could see every day members of Parliament from Quebec getting up and urging other members of Parliament from outside Quebec to pass that patriation package .
hon. David Anderson
he too made an attempt with the Meech Lake accord , the Charlottetown accord and other formulas .
i would point out to the member that if he truly believes in referendums , then he should not be here because he only got 49 per cent of the vote .
he was very clear .
we are proud to have done so .
the Government of Canada is only one of several that are participating .
there are a few other little things we would like to have from the hon. minister concerning this agreement .
this is not debatable in order to protect the public .
younger Canadians want the CPP to be there when they need it , and they expect it to be flexible .
if we took a portion of that money and put it into a private sector plan , instead of retiring on $ 8,000 a year the numbers could get up to $ 24,000 , $ 30,000 or $ 40,000 based on what people have been investing in mutual funds over the last 100 years since they have been available .
let me say first that I do not share the hon. member ' s pessimism about the state of the CRTC as it currently exists .
i have concluded that this case constitutes a grievance on the part of the hon. member , but since this situation has not actually precluded the hon. member from participating in a parliamentary proceeding the Chair cannot find that a case of a contempt of parliament has occurred .
in conclusion , I again quote that newly elected member of Parliament speaking in 1963 and saying : " The people of Canada will find in the Liberal program the solution to their problems '' .
Mr. Speaker , I am wondering if he would like to reflect on what his party views as sacrifice .
Mr. Speaker , my question has to do with the number one issue that the member referred to .
if he is consistent in what he says , his answer will be a resounding yes .
Mr. David Price :
the constitutional amendment proposed today does not run counter to the interests of that community .
on the west coast of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador some disagreement came about which had to go to court .
in fact , about 75 percent of seniors , which includes nine elderly women out of ten , will have an income that is either equal to or higher than their present income .
hon. David M. Collenette
we are not afraid to take the challenges of responsibility .
i am pleased to introduce this bill and I look forward to the support of my colleagues in the House on this important piece of legislation .
comments DURING QUESTION PERIOD
Mr. Speaker , no surprise was involved .
is he afraid his arguments will not stand up to ours ?
we educate our youth only to find that they have to move out to get a job .
we agreed with that request .
as well she has imputed that members during the election campaign were going out and soliciting votes in exchange for some consideration which is contrary to the Canada Elections Act .
the Liberal government has cut unemployment insurance by billions of dollars , turning a deaf ear to the cries of alarm coming from the unemployed and from seasonal workers .
Mr. Speaker , Namaste , Sasri - Kal , Ram - Ram , Ya Ali Madat and Jambo .
perhaps plan B could have worked at another time , but it will not now .
maybe in Quebec I am restricted as to the schools I can send my children , but that is for the Quebec people to decide .
i think it is fair to say this is a major payroll tax increase .
as previously noted , the actions of one province affecting minority or majority rights in education may set important precedents regarding educational rights of majorities in other provinces .
we believe that we need to start to lower taxes , we need to start to pay down debt so that we can get the economy going , so that we can start to create jobs that Canadians in all parts of the country need .
DONKIN MINE
in conclusion , I would like to address the issue of ministerial responsibility .
certainly not from the wealthy taxpayers who take advantage of tax havens , but rather from the middle class , whose tax burden is getting heavier and heavier .
accordingly , a few revisions have been made .
i have listened to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs a number of times through the media .
i am sure that in its discussions the fact that the changes proposed by the Government of Quebec have no bearing on minority educational rights in other provinces will be raised and reinforced .
the first 1993 red book promise broken was that of a national child care program .
it is threatened because of the actions of this government and this Prime Minister and failed leadership .
if it is not , I will certainly make sure it is by the end of this term .
it was filled with vague generalities and all kinds of platitudes with not a whole lot of meat or substance .
section 5.3 says that the management committee will be responsible for issuing annual reports to the minister on the progress achieved by this agreement .
i urge Quebecers to hear the message coming from Calgary and to join in building on it .
the question was how much .
some hon. members :
as I have had the opportunity to cross the country and engage in conversations with other partners , other members of Canadian society who want to be part of a new relationship , I am optimistic about the strategies that our provinces and territories are focusing on .
for those reasons we cannot support today ' s motion of non - confidence in the government .
if we look at the last budget we have made substantial commitments and this finance minister in his last financial budget made a commitment of over $ 300 million for the disabled community .
i would hope in the course of this that he understands the role he can play as a member of Parliament as we build together a strategy that will ensure all aboriginal people participate fully in the wealth and prosperity of this great country .
it has been a long voyage for society , from tribalism to this Canadian Parliament .
not a pseudo - partnership where Quebec would simply carry out orders from Ottawa , but a fruitful partnership between two sovereign countries .
one of the most important components of the Canada pension plan system is the disability feature .
it is an honour and a privilege to salute them .
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) :
i take exception to that .
ordinary Canadians are still waiting to be consulted .
Mr. Speaker , you will remember that the national conference on youth and the new economy had young participants from everywhere , including eastern and western Canada , Quebec and other regions of the country .
agreed .
i am addressing myself directly now to the member for Winnipeg North Centre .
Mr. Paul Mercier ( Terrebonne - Blainville , BQ ) :
this past August the Whitby Warriors won the Minto Cup as the best Junior A lacrosse team in Canada .
hear , hear .
i agree with this member 100 percent on that .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
i believe if that space is out of balance between economics and politics we are all in trouble in terms of meeting the needs of the people in our nations .
madam Speaker , I would like to congratulate the hon. member on her speech .
the Speaker :
second reading
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
i bring it to your attention , Mr. Speaker , and ask that it be brought to the attention of the House leaders .
i need not remind members of the House that a breach of privilege occurs according to all the precedents when there is some improper obstruction to the member in performing his parliamentary work .
we all know that , in the vast majority of cases , their financial situation is extremely difficult .
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) :
they are issues that I really should not even need to talk about in this place and there would be no need to talk about them if as I mentioned earlier we were truly representing our constituents .
madam Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to speak on Bill C - 2 , which will have an impact on the future of Canadians .
my point is that the individual and the government are linked together by an artery .
part of that responsibility is to ensure that Canadians of all ages and all circumstances can count on a secure retirement .
is there unanimous consent for the hon. member to move the motion ?
David Crane , in the Toronto Star on September 16 of this year , wrote :
it is the duty of the Chair to inform this House that a fourth ballot will be necessary .
to my constituents in Melbourne and Mount Brydges and all other areas who are dealing with the reality of crime at home and in their businesses , I pledge to work on their behalf for an improved and strengthened Young Offenders Act .
however , what is more significant is that there is no corresponding increase in the benefits that will be paid to the people who will actually benefit from the CPP .
the success of this approach demonstrates what can be accomplished when governments and the private sector work together .
earlier today the member for Medicine Hat referred to the member for Saint John as a New Democrat because she expressed compassion for the underprivileged .
routine PROCEEDINGS
it is a delight to be in this new parliament because we have two parties that are diametrically opposed .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask the House leader the nature of government business for the rest of this week and for the week when we reconvene .
we will also seek to address the special needs of aboriginal youth through the creation of urban multipurpose aboriginal youth centres which will provide a relevant cultural and supportive environment capable of encouraging first nations youth to stay in school and complete their education and which will offer career planning and employment opportunities .
the Caisse is expected to play a diversified and necessary role .
i reassert my pledge to work hard as a member of the official opposition to press the government to bring much needed and long overdue tax relief to these and all citizens of Canada .
i urge all the youth of Nunavut and the rest of Canada to participate in sports either as athletes or as volunteers .
the FAMILY
they will rise over the next six years , peaking at 9.9 percent in 2003 .
Mr. Speaker , I found the speech by the hon. member to have some very creative accounting .
her life was consumed by the simple goal of providing food , education , medical care , love and hope to the sick and desolate .
we see the Liberals running around seeking praise for such a great job they say that they have done but , to use the famous phrase of the finance minister , the fact is what they have really been doing is pulling on their magic tax lever to fill their coffers while Canadian businesses and Canadian workers have had less and less to spend , less and less to invest and less and less to save .
federal - provincial reviews will be required every three years instead of every five .
Mr. Speaker , on the occasion of Premier Frank McKenna ' s resignation I rise today on behalf of my colleagues to wish him well .
conservative PARTY
this has made it very difficult for veterans .
it creates jobs , lets small business become the small engine of the economy that we know it to be .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
but now they would have us believe they are complying with the Human Rights Tribunal order by launching a recruiting campaign aimed exclusively at women and known as " Operation Minerva '' .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
instead of taking a team Canada trade mission to Latin America this year , perhaps it should concentrate right at home and correct some of the problems it has the power to look after .
the savings in each Canadian super RRSP would be individually invested , managed by government approved financial institutions and would be the property of that Canadian .
they are saying they looked at it from the point of view of rescuing the plan .
i also hope the Quebec premier , who is currently in France , will raise the issue with his Parisian friends .
Mr. Charlie Penson
by connecting Canadians to the information highway , we will create a demand for digital content , which could strengthen Canada ' s cultural identity and create new economic opportunities .
NDP members keep going on and on about the Conrad Blacks .
this is a major change and a concession on the minister ' s behalf .
signatures were forged , false photographs were used .
but of course Halifax is where I have spent most of my life and Halifax is the riding I have the privilege to represent here in the Parliament of Canada .
clearly all parties could have done better in eliminating the deficit and reducing the debt .
furthermore , these regional development programs are subject to abuse by pork barrelling politicians .
some of my colleagues opposite have described this increase as a tax grab .
Mr. Speaker , harmonizing the GST and the QST resulted in considerable costs estimated at over $ 2 billion and paid for by the Quebec government alone .
by working together , by being bold , by conquering fear and despair , Canadians have done much for themselves and for others .
the 297 bed facility will be the regional hospital for all of Simcoe County and beyond .
that is a critical priority for the welfare of all .
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) :
with the exception of this small overture , what can be seen clearly in this speech is the federal government ' s stubborn determination not to recognize the legitimate right of Quebec to decide its own future .
the latest product of the Liberal spin doctors is the seniors benefit which we understand will be introduced in this parliament .
ATLANTIC CANADA
we put this regime in place .
we work hard and we work long hours .
i declare the motion carried .
Mr. Speaker , taxpayers would wind up paying 9.9 percent of their salary as a result of the Canada pension plan as proposed by the Liberals .
in the three decades since the CPP was adopted , the poverty rate among Canadians 65 and older fell to 10.9 % in 1995 from 33.5 % in 1980 .
foreign political parties or governments or trade unions with no bargaining rights in Canada are also prohibited .
the HST which is the harmonized sales tax and the GST are performing a function which replaces the manufacturing tax .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
they are eligible for certain programs .
i would also like to point out that the intent of the Fathers of Confederation with respect to section 93 , the one that is amended by this Quebec amendment , was to provide exclusive provincial jurisdiction over education , subject only to certain provisions for the protection of minority rights .
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
the meaner Ottawa gets , the leaner Calgary becomes .
to suggest that such decisions are taken by the government is simply incorrect .
it is different .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
they have gone from a lucrative , active bunch of people to living in conditions today which are absolutely deplorable .
that is what we are here to do , to work toward a solution .
we have numerous points to make with respect to the defects of the bill .
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) :
economists inside and outside the department have been saying for years that the federal government cannot spend its way to lower unemployment and that irresponsible spending and taxation is what is keeping unemployment high .
i and many of my colleagues in this caucus are trying to juggle our work as a members of Parliament and also our responsibility to our children .
in closing , the key to this process is open discussion .
the fund for young entrepreneurs is used to secure loans for projects in sectors identified as priorities in the investment plan of each CFDC .
routine PROCEEDINGS
we have made headway and positive change has occurred .
both the chief executive officer and the full - time president would be responsible for the day to day operations of the board .
the one sentencing measure actually made sentencing easier rather than tougher .
we know that , with a federal debt of $ 600 billion which is 74 % of Canada ' s entire yearly economic output , we are way beyond where we should be .
George ' s was kind enough to apprise me that he was going to rise and ask for an emergency debate at this time .
and only after it has fulfilled these obligations should the federal government think about lowering taxes or reducing the debt .
he was appointed by the Liberal Party .
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua ( Vaughan - King - Aurora , Lib . ) :
instead of concentrating on rebuilding what it had destroyed , the federal government has embarked on new intrusions in areas under provincial jurisdiction .
now he is a member of the Reform Party .
to shift responsibility for refinancing the CPP to those who are least able to do so , as our Liberal friends are proposing , is irresponsible and will have a harmful impact on future generations .
he endorsed the national unity process , the process the premiers were talking about in Calgary .
Mr. Dale Johnston :
i am close to them still in heart and also geographically as I am literally the girl next door in the riding of Edmonton North .
as I mentioned earlier , I have given the minister written notice of such a question and , unfortunately , I am afraid that I may not have the information necessary to follow through with this question .
the Liberals would love me to shut up about this topic .
Ms. Colleen Beaumier
one was cash buying .
let me ask the prime minister this .
Mr. Rob Anders
Mr. Inky Mark ( Dauphin - Swan River , Ref. ) :
our goal is to make Canada the most connected country in the world , making sure that all Canadians can have access to the electronic highway and information economy by the year 2000 .
government CONTRACTS
i have two questions for the minister .
interparliamentary DELEGATIONS
so there are two questions :
on an operating basis we have surpluses of moneys with which we can gradually pay down that debt .
i know the hon. member across the way mentioned the fact that we mentioned aboriginals in the Speech from the Throne eight or ten times .
Mr. Grant Hill :
Mr. Speaker , Canada happens to be one of the most decentralized federations in the world , and together we have built a federation that has provided us with the best quality of life of any country .
today the Canadian Medical Association celebrates its 130 th anniversary , making it one of the oldest associations in Canada .
greatness may have a different meaning , but it will still be Canadian .
that is going to mean a lot of work .
i am appalled at the irresponsible manner in which the associate chief justice , who is responsible for the proper functioning of the federal court trial division conducts the business of the court .
indeed , as I like to say , when the auditor testified before the committee , he mentioned the Quebec Pension Plan as an example to follow .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
if not , why did the government presume to spend it on behalf of these people who would not give it ?
the United States have announced that they will challenge our dairy production system before the World Trade Organization , on the grounds that we subsidize our dairy product exports .
that treaty relationship is fundamental because it recognizes that when my ancestors came here there were governments that were working effectively and providing for their people .
this board is essentially similar to Quebec ' s Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement , except that it will not have any economic mandate .
in fact the leader of the Conservative Party sat here in government for over nine years .
first , what is a realistic projection of future surpluses once the federal books are balanced ?
a quarter of Canadians tell us that they go to bed worried about job security , worried about whether the next day they are going to have enough money to put bread on the table and take care of their families .
the committee agreed that it was a valid amendment .
another chief priority of the government is supporting innovation in Canada ' s economy .
that is a 300 % increase over the same period in the previous year .
nothing at all .
the current President of the Treasury Board gave it away when he told Le Soleil on March 8 , 1996 , and I quote : " When Bouchard has to make cuts , we in Ottawa will be able to show that we have the means to preserve the future of our social programs '' .
they can make plans , develop skills , raise families and put their wages into the marketplace to the benefit of their fellow citizens .
second , by the end of the current calendar year , after years of work , we are going to have a point of sale system in place that will let pharmacists know that there is a problem with the prescription .
Mr. Mac Harb
all stakeholders recognize that we must curtail the migration of young people from their native communities to major centres .
she has attacked the reputation of an honest and outstanding member of the Shawinigan business community .
does this minister think that debt and that kind of serious economic problem creates hope for young Canadians ?
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) :
the people of Canada spoke loudly on June 2 and now we as a government must get on and do what we said we would do .
is it agreed ?
this time it is only going to be 15 % or 20 % . "
Mr. Peter Adams
some hon. members :
once this bill on the CPP is passed , it will be very important to hold a true consultation across the country regarding the seniors benefit .
where is the vision ?
today , eight years later , their numbers have remained virtually the same , with women accounting for a mere 10.7 per cent of the Canadian Armed Forces .
the Conservative Party ought simply to allow the investigation to run its course .
the actions of one province affecting minority and majority rights in education may set important precedents regarding educational rights of majorities and minorities in other provinces .
this is what federal government after federal government gave our country again and again to serve their own short term political ends at the cost of nearly bankrupting our nation .
we cannot sit here passively , talking about minor shifts in trade and changes to trade policy or tinkering and so on with various social programs .
the petitions contain 100 signatures from Medicine Hat , over 300 from Lethbridge , 132 from Winnipeg - Selkirk , 62 from Regina , and hundreds more from the St. Catharines area of Ontario .
hence we have a real crisis .
i represent a riding that once had a former Prime Minister as a member of Parliament .
criminal Code
governments have a crucial role to play in supporting science , technology , and the creation of knowledge .
i support and continue to call on all members of this House to take this issue seriously and to work with their respective premiers or territorial leaders in making sure that the proposals put forward are understood and are a reflection of what Canadians want in a country .
apparently the Chief Justice of the Federal Court either has no power to influence the conduct of the Associate Chief Justice or does not wish to do so .
of course , that suggests that the government will be spending about $ 7 billion to $ 10 billion on new programs every year by the end of its mandate .
accessibility to bargain basement standards is not what was intended nor what Canadians expect .
this government is restricting our privileges as members of Parliament to debate the most important tax issue of this Parliament .
however , as you know , I am more interested in certain points than in others .
i do not propose any other legislation for tomorrow .
as the former chairman of the Waterloo regional police I can also say that drop - outs from school and society often fall into the trap of crime and become young offenders .
why does the minister allow bureaucrats to overrule the information provided by these scientists ?
perhaps we should use the methods of the First Nations people to try to fix the disunity of this country and this Parliament .
let us look at the Canada pension plan .
the amendment it is seeking is more administrative in nature .
the preferred emphasis was on " hard sciences '' , leaving universities like the Universit 茅 du Qu 茅 bec 脿 Montr 茅 al , which does not have a medical or engineering faculty , out of luck .
but first , I must condemn this Speech from the Throne for promoting nothing less than a Pierre Elliott Trudeau style of federalism with all its consequences .
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
we have much incompetence in government .
i hear the name Peggy Witte of Royal Oak Mines in Yellowknife and here he is using her as an example of a proud business person in Canada .
CALGARY DECLARATION
as indicated , I think we will find agreement with most of them .
last week a congressional committee on the Pacific salmon treaty heard testimony in Washington from key stakeholders .
i hope the results will be known very soon .
designers made huge errors in their projections of birth rate , numbers of contributors and rates of economic growth .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
i think the member for Calgary Southwest should have recognized that he was criticizing MPs as MPs rather than criticizing the government .
essentially this is a three strikes and you are out bill .
there is an answer that has to do with demographic changes in society .
Ms. Angela Vautour :
Mr. Gurmant Grewal
Paul and his employees know firsthand the importance of the Technology Partnerships Canada and represent the support for technology that has been committed by our government .
Mr. Lee Morrison
it does not belong to the governments , although in the past they acted like it did .
this is scandalous .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as far as I know that is being put into place .
what it should do is conduct an in - depth review of Telefilm Canada ' s film policy , which was seriously criticized in an internal report .
it is not a tax .
what was the free trade deal they were talking about ?
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) :
* * *
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
at the same time , I thought that , in any event , this is going to be a centralizing tool .
on the other hand , if we were to have a $ 1 billion cutback in the GST , we would create some 17,000 jobs .
madam Speaker , I want to say two things .
i would also like to detail the proposed amendments that are aimed at both rejuvenating and modernizing the Canadian Wheat Board and putting control over its activities squarely in the hands of producers .
indeed they were also concerned about national unity , Canada ' s role as a trading nation and Canada ' s role as an international broker of peace , her role generally in the global village .
i was speaking about the truths that I hope to convey to some of the government members on the other side .
Mrs. Sue Barnes
it is very clear that the policies we have put in place have worked .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
speaker ' S RULING
Mr. Speaker , the Liberals speak quite frequently of protecting Canada ' s culture which is a very noble cause I am sure .
pursuant to order made on Tuesday , September 23 , 1997 , this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o ' clock .
i hope my hon. colleague will help us when that legislation is reintroduced into the House .
the prime minister is digging himself deeper and deeper .
Kitchener ' s rich ethnic diversity and cultural wealth have certainly aided the development of various industries including tourism .
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) :
i thought of an analogy .
this is very good news .
Mr. Speaker , I ask that all questions be allowed to stand .
we know that through the new seniors benefit , when that proposal comes to the House , nine out of ten elderly women will be better off .
i never asked my electors in my riding to vote for the NDP .
they were not daft , or were they ?
working together with members of Parliament , with the provinces and , above all , with Canadians , we have removed the burden on our future that the deficit represented .
we had to reduce the disastrous deficit of $ 42 billion left by the Conservative Party .
so they want to force Quebeckers to choose between being like Pacific salmon or facing the threats of plan B .
we saw that here the other day in the debate on supply as the right - wingers from across the floor argued for tax breaks for the wealthy when we should be investing in programs that meet the needs of ordinary Canadians .
before I proceed , Mr. Speaker , I congratulate you on your appointment .
we wonder however if that message was understood .
national REVENUE
a last concern is that it has come to my attention that this committee will not be permitted to travel .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew :
has the government taken every measure necessary to secure funding for our health care system ?
and what did Trudeau say ?
the first thing we had to do was to put the finances of the nation in order .
the government made a commitment at the time to introduce a bill and start public consultations on the new benefit in the fall of 1996 .
when the provinces now borrow from the CPP , they will pay the same rate of interest that they do on their market borrowings .
they are the ones who should benefit from their struggles .
he was asleep a while ago .
he says that Canada is doing well .
i was happy to see at least in the Speech from the Throne an acknowledgement of the royal commission ' s report .
it helps them improve their competitiveness and create new opportunities .
Mr. Ted McWhinney
i chaired the social policy committee and there were terrible fights .
they expect us to demonstrate vision and values .
that will give us the base on which to build a strong country .
it is difficult today to get across the media of each language and speak with one another , but we have this forum to come together and resolve perhaps what has not yet been resolved .
the owners of health food stores in my riding of Nanaimo - Cowichan have told me about the arbitrary removal of hundreds of products from their shelves by the health protection branch .
government CONTRACTS
what has the government done ?
oh , oh .
young offenders are one of the greatest tragedies of crime .
* * *
among other things , he refuses to accept the democratic rule of 50 percent plus one ; he wants to draft the referendum question himself ; he argues that all Canadians should have their say in the future of the Quebec people ; and finally he tries to use the justices of the Supreme Court by having them declare the democratic choice of Quebeckers illegal .
routine PROCEEDINGS
Mr. Speaker , as the hon. member knows , Canada was one of the leaders and an inspiration to the third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .
a number of regressive measures were put into the system , the excuse being that there was not enough money , but by December 31 , 1997 there will be a surplus of $ 13 billion in the employment insurance fund .
it was started by Ronald Reagan .
there is another survey from Ms. Tremblay which she does every parliamentary session , $ 41,000 down the drain again , asking us whether we think there should be more women in Parliament and what we should do to arrange that .
Mr. Speaker , will the minister tell us how the Prime Minister can agree to discuss the Dorval airport issue with the mayor of Montreal but refuse to discuss the Mirabel airport issue with the premier of Quebec , as he told us on Friday ?
port POLICE
many in the House today are having their first taste of Parliament .
which will it be ?
Mr. Speaker , I would like to point to one thing stated by the minister .
i have a petition from Canadians in the provinces of Quebec and Ontario who call on Parliament and the government to declare that Canada is indivisible and that Canada ' s boundaries should not be altered without a free vote of Canadian citizens or using the amending formula contained in the Canadian Constitution .
it is my duty to inform the House that a third vote will be necessary .
neither is our goal free trade at any cost .
if I have a concern about the debate that took place in this Chamber , it is that it was badly divided between two opposition parties that I believe fundamentally support the separation of this country .
i think the member has the history on that issue quite backward .
for example if someone lies , we are not allowed to call them a liar .
these were the conclusions of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources , in which I participated , in reports tabled in 1994 and 1996 .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau :
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) :
there is a Canadian constitutional order that will apply until international law takes over .
i worked with colleagues on both sides of the House .
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
Mr. Lorne Nystrom
today in 1997 there are too many fishers and too few fish and a Liberal government with egg on its face and an Atlantic wipe - out to prove it .
before we get into questions and comments hon. members , I would ask that the questions and the responses be kept relatively brief .
those are my two questions .
they were offered an immediate tax cut and they declined .
they too believe that our future as a country is too precious for us to risk losing it through misunderstanding .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) :
after discussing increases in CPP contribution rates , Joe Italiano whom I quoted a few moments ago wrote these words : " These increases have had and will continue to have a negative impact on the labour force .
perhaps the most hurtful statement of all was " you politicians are all the same '' .
he must answer those questions , and I ask him to correct all the nonsense he has been saying .
nays
that is my own personal thoughts on it .
at the time , and this is another point raised by the hon. member , those provinces interested in implementing the GST were told to harmonize their provincial sales tax at their own expense , but that they would benefit from a much greater efficiency in the five or ten years that would follow , thanks to a more modern and fairer tax system .
it is unclear what members opposite are objecting to .
my question is for the Prime Minister .
Mr. Speaker , the National Parole Board and Correctional Services Canada are investigating this incident .
Mr. Speaker , before I came to the House I travelled extensively .
royal VICTORIA HOSPITAL
the Deputy Speaker :
there is more they will not want to hear .
the short answer is yes , subject to the democratic will of the farmers themselves .
it is available at the table and posted at each voting station .
Mr. Monte Solberg
where is the democracy in this bill ?
this is a screwball agreement .
people who have been working for 20 or 25 years in the civilian military are now being made redundant or are being put on affected status .
the Bloc Quebecois will do everything in its power to help the government reduce its deficit .
i deplore that the Bloc Quebecois chose to use Justice Bastarache ' s appointment as an excuse to launch into another unwarranted attack against Canadian federalists .
as the member has recognized , it creates jobs and a secure future for us .
in addition , under Bill C - 4 the Canadian Wheat Board will be able to adjust management adjustment payments during any crop year much more quickly by removing the need to first obtain cabinet approval .
if members recall the throne speech - it is quite a while ago - it seemed that even the Prime Minister appeared to be having trouble staying awake .
why will the minister not turf the senior bureaucrats who are responsible for trying to hide the truth before another bad report comes in ?
Mr. Bill Blaikie
the Speaker
they want to have their say , not after the ink is dry on the agreement but before the government enters into any such deal .
prayers
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
the people of Canada have rewarded the Liberal record and have chosen to reaffirm their trust .
according to a July 1997 Angus Reid poll , 52 % of Canadians have lost faith in our courts and our justice system .
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner :
fisheries
we know the buzzword of fair taxation from that party brings with it a political agenda that somewhat represents the politics of envy , taxing the rich and what they used to call the corporate welfare bums and all the philosophy that goes with it .
the ages of early retirement , normal retirement , or late retirement all remain unchanged .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien :
it spans three different time zones and the population is roughly 25,000 people .
* * *
at this point I would like to reflect on some of the very important initiatives that were introduced to this House and in our relationship by the former Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , the Hon. Ron Irwin .
sixth , it is not hard to understand , in fact it is quite simple : if the federal government minded its business and refrained from interfering in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction , I am sure it would save money .
in saying that , I also believe that the CEO should be appointed by the board of directors , not by government .
fifty years ago this country had a serious problem of poverty among its elderly .
Ms. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or , NDP ) :
routine PROCEEDINGS
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to take part in the debate on the act to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to amend the Canada pension plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts .
they resigned because they were so disillusioned with the lousy political system .
Mr. Speaker , the equality of citizens and provinces became a huge factor and played a large part in the Calgary premiers conference last week .
foreign AFFAIRS
they are slowing the growth in costs by tightening the administration of benefits and changing the way some are calculated .
hon. Paul Martin
i suggest that we await the outcome of the appeal .
since political parties are necessary to our democracy , those political parties must be healthy , alive and involved in the health of our democracy .
this investment approach is a common practice among Canada investment funds .
the RCMP must perform its duty , and it will .
i know it is difficult for members of the opposition to understand that .
with the system we have put in place to look after the pension plan , it will be there for one and all when we retire , if we so choose to retire .
why does the Reform party want to waste its time debating something that is so simple ?
Canadians are in need of legislation that secures future needs but will not rob them of their independence to manage their present and future plans .
* * *
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
they request that Parliament support Motion No. 300 which states that in the opinion of the House the government should authorized a proclamation to be issued by the governor general amending section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to recognize the fundamental rights of individuals to pursue family life free from undue interference by the state and to recognize the fundamental rights and responsibility of parents to direct the upbringing of their children and urge the legislative assemblies of other provinces to do likewise .
by connecting Canadians , by realizing our international potential , by investing in innovation and knowledge , and by increasing the participation of Canadians in the new economy we are acting to turn the promise of a new century into new opportunity for all Canadians .
Mrs. Rose - Marie Ur
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien
taxes are quite simply too high .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
the measures proposed in the bill today will become law once the legislation is passed by parliament and supporting orders in council are received from the provinces that are party to last February ' s agreement .
the hon. member has my assurance that we will continue in that effort .
for some reason , he missed that .
where our last budget offered $ 137 million in post - secondary education support for 1997 and substantially increased scholarship and tax credits for post - secondary students and their families , the Speech from the Throne commits to a new millennium scholarship endowment fund intended to reward academic excellence and to open access to universities and colleges for the well qualified children from low and moderate income families throughout Canada .
i am very pleased to speak to Bill C - 2 , an act to establish the Canada pension plan investment board and to amend the Canada pension plan .
it has indicated that it is now again able to invest not only in economic growth , which it will continue to do , but increasingly in the development of Canadian society and of its human resources - men , women , and young people - the primary capital of Canadian society .
i did not want to begin this without saying the words that all Speakers have used for hundreds of years now .
i raised a question in the House last week and asked the minister responsible what the government was prepared to do to provide real financial assistance to students .
Mr. Bill Blaikie :
now unemployed people , students , have to travel up to 100 km to get services .
on March 7 , the Minister of Human Resources Development approved the project , and on March 21 the SQDM or Quebec manpower development board issued a similar positive recommendation .
we understand that this increase is due to adjustments required to ensure that the plan can meet the objectives for which it was created .
Mr. Preston Manning
by putting Internet access points in rural communities we are giving rural citizens the same opportunities to access information and resources that urban Canadians enjoy .
it is subject to the commodity organization which best represents the producers of that grain asking for it .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
we are referred to in the House by the name of our riding .
unfortunately I will not have time to go through the whole folder today but I can promise members they will hear about it all over the coming weeks .
if we really had a payday here and we can do both , terrific .
then we will have something to be proud enough about to even buy a flag ourselves .
in fact Canada has either signed or negotiated up to 50 of the agreements .
another thing that upsets me about this throne speech is that the Liberals take credit for the entire Calgary declaration that Quebec is a unique society .
Canadians feel better about their own future and the country ' s future .
the Reform Party has been the most active in recognizing victims ' rights .
finally , this government tabled a bill for the protection of endangered species .
maybe the time has come to look at the other house and make those senators accountable , whether it be for their attendance or what they say , for the sake of this country .
madam Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
he called a 30 day referendum , whipped up public sentiment , went to the polls and won .
he is correct on that point , but obviously , as I said earlier in my presentation , the simple fact is that he is not listening .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
" while provincial spending increased from 2.5 percent of GDP in 1960 to 6 percent of GDP in 1995 and local government spending went from 4.74 percent to almost 6 percent , signifying greater participation in the provision of direct goods and services in each province , the federal level only dipped from 6.2 percent of GDP to 4.22 percent of the GDP over the same timeframe '' .
my mother who is 84 years old had come from New Zealand thinking that it was going to be a joyous , happy campaign and she was reduced to sobbing her heart out on the first night that she was here .
a 9.9 % contribution rate sounds definitely better for my children than going to 14 % later '' .
i am delighted because this government has restored our nation ' s finances to order .
reform believes that the YOA is a priority and thus the reason for our bill and the amendments to lower the age from 12 to 10 , to raise 16 and 17 year olds to adult court , automatically transferring serious violent young offenders into adult court aged 14 and 15 and removing the privacy provision for young offenders convicted of violent offences , particularly repeat violent offenders .
in the name of national unity this government should readdress its wrong headed firearms legislation .
as soon as Quebec wants to adopt its resolution , I would ask the Government of Quebec to do likewise .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis
he will realize , after reading his own remarks , that he did not understand what I said .
hon. Paul Martin
our focus now must be to construct real opportunities on the foundations already laid .
introduction and first reading
- the Speaker does not rule on whether a breach of privilege or a contempt has in fact been committed .
currently our plant employs 790 employees working on two contracts .
that is what this bill deals with .

i was critic on tobacco in the last Parliament .
we are constantly seeking out new partnerships and new forms of investment in order to build the kind of research strength which we would all like to see .
team Canada , a youth service Canada project , placed young people in local businesses seeking to expand their export potential .
Mr. Alex Shepherd :
the proportion of seniors in Canada will rise from 12 percent today to 16 percent by the year 2016 , which is not as far away as it sounds , and to nearly 25 percent of the population by the year 2040 .
it is a concern to Canadians when anything like this happens .
that is not the popular view for me to take in my province right now , but I feel very strongly that ignoring the rights of those people will set a very bad precedent for other minority groups in this country .
the hon. member and all Canadians can put in a bid , they can even use the Internet to do so , and I can assure you that there is no influence peddling and that it is all done by the book and in accordance with the law .
multiculturalism
we find all the government ' s references to high technology tiresome because the rhetoric is there and yet we cannot even get electronic voting in this House .
we can all cite examples , the CHST , employment insurance , CPP , and that contradiction in terms called the seniors benefit .
i am very proud to be part of a government that recognizes the importance of some of these building tools and building blocks .
the board will be subject to investment rules similar to other public and private funds in Canada .
Mr. Speaker , the second petition , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , is tabled on behalf of 37 constituents of my riding .
first of all those numbers that the member has just quoted are garbage .
it really seemed a fraud .
the GST was never abolished as far as I know .
now it is time to purge the bureaucrats from the ranks .
Mr. Bouchard has changed , unlike the hon. member for Bourassa , who ran against me in 1990 .
there is also the question of whether this was an isolated case .
the prime minister is going to do another Team Canada trip in January .
i would be remiss if I did not seize this opportunity to thank , from the bottom of my heart , the constituents of Sherbrooke , Fleurimont and Lennoxville who have re - elected me for the fourth time .
it is to that end that I will devote my energies as a representative .
if CPP did survive under Liberal mismanagement it would only pay out $ 8,800 per year , even with maximum contributions .
people tender for them and win them based on how good their tender is .
Mr. Peter Goldring
that is unacceptable and is shameful .
i am sure that members know .
it is not often that we get praise from Conservative members and political opponents , so I am accepting it on behalf of my party .
hear , hear .
am I to trust the members across the way who have done such a poor job with the money they have been entrusted with , or am I to trust the people themselves to look after a plan ?

the Speaker :
there is no connection to the forces of innovation and change and reform that are at large in the country which if harnessed to national policy will help propel Canada into the 21 st century with vigour and optimism .
they are fearful because of a murder which occurred 15 years ago .
there are many children living in poverty .

the efforts of these radar technicians were crucial in withstanding the assault of the Third Reich , the eventual victory for the Allies and the end of World War II.
the baby boomers are coming .
i am confident that the majority of Canadians will see them as vital investments in our national growth and security .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te
they are the people who used to make things and it is they who built this nation .
i do not think it is .
no company at all .
Mr. Werner Schmidt :
since there is no mention of this in the throne speech , are we to understand that the government has already forgotten its promise ?
madam Speaker , I would like to tell you a story about some mad scientists .
i heard him speak about the need for the wheat board to be more accountability , yet when we take that action in the bill he wants to toss it out .
it even invites us to celebrate this future success ahead of time .
this is one of the new realities we have been talking about .
by using Canadian passports as part of their cover , Israeli agents have made Canadians unwitting players in a very dangerous game .
Mr. John Duncan
i would ask , Mr. Speaker , that you take that as the major consideration .
the Speaker
federal , provincial and territorial governments have agreed to address in a co - operative way the problems of low - income families with children .

members
as you know this is my second mandate .
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I have the honour to present five petitions , all of which are identical in form and content .
in conclusion , I will simply say that we cannot solve the problems of the 1990 s with the solutions of the 1970 s .
Mr. Jim Abbott
this is why I am very surprised by the events that took place in recent days .
young people in this country are getting very frustrated because they cannot get ahead .
police AND PEACE OFFICERS
something totally unbelievable happened after that .
Mr. Michel Gauthier
Mr. Speaker , my question is directed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for Portneuf for his question .
endangered SPECIES
our federal system allows us to rally our forces for the common good , but it is flexible enough to facilitate the full expression of regional identities .
our high tax burden is a very serious detriment to retaining strong people .
all Canadians have a stake in meeting this challenge successfully .
will they all be 10 minute speeches ?
the hon. member knows that a minister is not able to respond to matters that are before a quasi - judicial review board .
there is nothing in this speech about the new ideas that are out there and nothing related to Atlantic Canada .
it strikes me as we talk of the new millennium that January 1 , 2000 is a day after December 31 , 1999 . Let us not miss the opportunity to accomplish as much as we did in the last two years in the next two years .
this is fine rhetoric , but nothing concrete is ever done .
the road to democracy is not a freeway .
Mr. David Chatters
main ESTIMATES , 1997 - 98
the fact that younger Canadians will be asked to pay many times more for their CPP retirement benefits than their parents or grandparents is no longer news .
it is in that kind of highly charged atmosphere that Premier Tobin will bring forth his version of term 17 to this honourable House .
this also comes from a party with a leader who drives around with a chauffeur and a car that he said he would never drive around in .
we like to see those who work , who contribute and who save be rewarded .
there was a joke going around a few years ago which asked :
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister knew from the beginning of last March that allegations of influence peddling had been made with respect to an organizer of the Liberal Party of Canada and that these allegations were sufficiently serious that a minister of his government put the RCMP in the picture .
you had to be there .
this is one of those occasions when it is being amended , therefore , it is a unique opportunity for members of the House of Commons to put their views on the record on what our national pension plan system should look like .
i would ask my colleague for more details on the subject , because it supports the concerns she expressed a few minutes ago .
madam Speaker , I thank the member for the question .
even more important was the overwhelming support of Canadians during the public consultation on the CPP .
and he made no mistake , because , as you know , entire chunks of Bill 101 were invalidated .
if it wants to reduce taxes , ensure that social programs benefit taxpayers to a greater extent and see the taxpayers ' debt at every level of government go down , all the federal government has to do is give back to the provinces the money it took away from them .
this is the most important economic decision the government will make in its mandate , the most important decision it will make as it leads Canadians into the new millennium .
however we recognize that the Canada pension plan is an important vehicle for those people in our society who need us to provide a level of support for them because they cannot provide that for themselves .
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) :
that is not the agenda of Atlantic Canadians , sir .
it was truly a happy occasion .
the federal government steps in , bringing with it further duplication of existing programs : it creates a new program that will do exactly the same thing .
in the Speech from the Throne , as we all stood in the Senate Chamber listening to the governor general present the flowery words of the government , I was struck by the different realities within these walls and without .
Mr. Andr 茅 Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) :
the minister has a choice opportunity here .
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the question .
we have seen this government go from province to province to province consulting on the best way to do it .
it will improve the quality and effectiveness of health services across Canada by establishing the Health Transition Fund to help the provincial governments innovate in the areas of primary care and provide more integration in the delivery of health services , home care and pharmacare .

through Investment Partnerships Canada , we are working with industry on a focused marketing campaign in priority markets to attract investment to Canada by multinational firms because investment equal jobs .

we can think of the forest industry and the people of Voisey ' s Bay .
they are the ones making decisions .
why are so many of our young people at risk ?
i really think these are fitting .
the enviable success of these programs would not have been achieved without the resources and overarching presence of the federal authority .
the reality is that a mandatory super RRSP is a tax as well .

the chief and council , the very ones grassroots aboriginal people have come to me for help on because they have a problem with them , are told they cannot get the information because it is the chief .
Canadians shared their confidence with us because they believe a balanced approach is the way to govern the country .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
this 9.9 percent rate is projected to be sufficient to sustain the CPP with no further rate increases .
our objective through this legislation , Bill C - 4 , is to continue to empower our farmers and make the Canadian Wheat Board an even better marketing institution .
i would suggest to the member , based on information I have received , that the letter from the Prime Minister on the Prime Minister ' s office letterhead to which she has referred in fact was merely an artist ' s rendition of it included in a Liberal Party fundraising package -
Mr. John Cannis ( Scarborough Centre , Lib . ) :
that is vital .
manslaughter is death resulting from accident .
what are we to make of the fact that the Solicitor General of Canada , who is in charge of the mounted police , like the Prime Minister calls them - somebody ought to tell him that it is now called the RCMP - was the only cabinet minister who did not know the Liberal Party of Canada was being investigated ?
who was retiring in the mid - sixties ?
it also states that parents of young offenders who have contributed to the delinquency of their child can be held responsible for restitution .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
either the government simply does not know what is going on , or the government does know what is going on and is reluctant to tell this House .
i now wish to take this opportunity to thank the people of Rimouski - Mitis for giving me their support .
Mrs. Pierrette Venne
in fact , in the coming weeks I myself will have the opportunity to meet with the experts and those active in the community .
the government put in place a marketing panel and when it brought in its report , the government cherry picked .
he strikes me as being full of good will .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
however , we want to know what leadership the government is taking to ensure the integrity and the security of Canadian passports .
the Speaker :
while section 93 guarantees the existence of denominational management structures in Montreal and Quebec City and the right of dissent in the rest of the province , section 23 allows the minority to control and manage linguistic school structures .
i say in applying glorious analogy to this throne speech , it is a dry bone speech lacking in the flesh and blood and muscle and sinew and heart and soul required to inspire Canadians for the 21 st century .
under this Prime Minister the -
in fact we have put in place along with the provinces one of the most modern and one of the most progressive retirement systems in the world .
we will take Canada into the new century and the new millennium .
we wonder why the Reform and Liberals embrace huge international pharmaceuticals in gouging Canadians on prescription drugs prices .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
no , it will not , but it can increase the understanding Canadians have for each other and work together with other initiatives at local , provincial and national levels to keep our country united .
it may well happen some time in the future that the House will receive a message from the other place informing us that it has passed a bill , or a number of bills for that matter , and inviting us to consider those measures .
fifty per cent of the debt is caused by the high interest rates that we saw during the Brian Mulroney years , another version of a very conservative party in Canada .
the right thing to do is to ignore the gossip mongers who are tarnishing people ' s reputations .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :

i hope this bill gets a good airing in this House .
Mr. Howard Hilstrom
i vividly recall returning to the land of my birth , Hungary , for the first time since leaving as a refugee in 1957 .
that is why it is time for the government to wake up and realize there are other options .
hon. Don Boudria :
i just hope he is talking about the promises contained in the second red book and not in the first red book , because those promises were not kept , and a minister was forced to resign and to seek re - election and another member was forced to join us here in the back .
when the parish began in 1897 , Saint - R 茅 mi had 59 families .
public SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION ACT
i want to encourage the minister and the people on that side of the House to stop misleading the Canadian people with the picture that we have arrived .
the government has presided over record bankruptcies .
fifty - four per cent of the cuts were to provincial transfers .
progress can be made and must be made toward the objectives that I have described if we are to sustain and to strengthen the high quality of health care of which we have all become proud in this country .

i hope the province of Quebec will demand to be an equal and vital member of the Canadian confederacy and will reject the false promises of separation .

whether it is hardworking families in the agricultural sector or industrious entrepreneurs in large and small businesses in cities , towns and rural districts , or families struggling to make ends meet raising their children , or the disadvantaged who are desperately seeking a better life , one common thread that ties them all together is the continuing erosion of their after tax income .

the Speaker :
speech FROM THE THRONE
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member ' s point is a very good one .
the seat I am taking in the House of Commons has been held by two of the greatest champions for social justice in our nation ' s history .
we believe that such a reformed Senate would go a long way in legitimizing the upper Chamber .
we are here on behalf of people everywhere saying the rhetoric that ran as thick as syrup in the Speech from the Throne will not end the despair of people living without work or living with the daily fear of losing the job they may now hold .
there should be an elected board of directors , not one that is appointed by government .
programs like Youth Services Canada are already operating in Windsor - St.
hon. Lawrence MacAulay
in return , I promise I will protect their interests with all I have got , candidly and perhaps a little impetuously at times , as I did today .
Mr. Speaker , my question is to the Minister for International Trade .
i am not ashamed to appear in front of my constituents .
theirs is not an investment that will bring in a mere 3 percent in interest ; it is a lot more profitable than that .
* * *
we as a government have made tremendous strides in our attack on child poverty .
however , he will realize that I am a passionate person , and I am not about to set this aspect of my personality aside just because it does not please the Liberals .
the words from Calgary are an attempt to express worthy Canadian values and that is how they should be welcomed .
once again Canadians have been consulted and Canadians have spoken .
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
reform PARTY
bill C - 228 .
i have two questions for the member who just spoke .
should the member take the trouble - if he ever has the time , the desire or the interest - he could no doubt come up with a list of the demands made by the various governments on language , fisheries or immigration .
we do not want to see a repeat of last year ' s attempts to force artists to promote Canadian unity , or to judge projects on the basis of political rather than artistic criteria , or to require artists to pay a visit to the member for Verdun , whom they did not know and had never met , in order to collect their cheque .
they have been joined by our government in moving forward .
i offer this challenge to all of you .
Mr. John Solomon
in this regard , the interests of Quebeckers are many .
i look forward to those challenges .
i am sorry to interrupt the minister , but the hon. member for West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast has the floor .
second , I will describe a plan that will save us from forever following that destructive and empty path .
failing being able to resolve this issue by consultation , section 93 of the Canadian Constitution clearly states that there shall be no restrictions or barriers to trade across interprovincial borders .
first the prime minister said he had never been informed of any such request by any government and then we find out that the CSIS and the Israeli agents are talking to each other on the very eve of this mission .

i declare the subamendment defeated .
we might consider that the same generation of people today , once again thinking about investments , are thinking about foreign investments .
the entire campaign turned into a personality thing distressing a lot of people .
Mr. Gerry Ritz ( Battlefords - Lloydminster , Ref. ) :
but we cannot provide more resources without allowing the committees to actually use them .
agreed .
i think his voice here will echo the concerns of Canadian workers , and there are other people who can play a similar role within the government party .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
the Speaker
government ORDERS
will the minister stop attempting to bury this issue , revisit her refusal to strike down section 745 , to prevent Bernardo and other killers from putting the families through this public , tortuous and senseless process of faint hope hearings ?
Mr. Speaker , this is the first time a federal government has so clearly indicated its intention of interfering in areas of provincial jurisdiction , especially education .
the alleged argument made by members is that somehow this sequence constitutes a question of privilege .
also , during the last Parliament when we were facing the issue of the referendum , Canadians , in particular those who were not born in this country , which is one out of six Canadians , were very strong within the province of Quebec on the whole issue of the referendum to make sure that we maintain Canada .
we do not know how this foundation will distribute the available funds among the provinces .
was it the minister who decided this should be referred to a subcommittee of the finance committee , fobbed off to a subcommittee where a number of members will not even have voting rights ?
as a matter of fact I am so enthused I was able to persuade my colleague the member for Qu ' Appelle to share his 10 minutes .
we need to think ahead .
it had run out of steam .
the government has faced up to an increase in the senior population and a shrinking workforce and has taken the necessary steps to ensure that one of the fundamental pillars of the Canada pension system will remain healthy for decades to come .
pursuant to Standing Order 3 , I invite Mr. Caccia , member for the electoral district of Davenport , to take the chair and preside over the election of a Speaker .
however , we cannot do this alone .
canada will never under a Liberal government , in any event , return to the financial crisis that we faced when we came to power in 1993 .
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
as I said , I made about $ 6,500 a house and I had the equivalent of 10 full - time positions .
some hon. members :
this allows all Canadians to prepare for their future together .
in recent years , Canadians worked hard and sacrificed to overcome many of our nation ' s challenges .
Mr. Speaker , when the minister of foreign affairs of a country expresses regret on behalf of his country and his government to the Minister of Foreign Affairs it is in my judgment an acknowledgement by that government .
i could list several hours worth of examples of government waste , but I will mention only two : promoting Canadian unity and promoting the Canadian flag , which has been recognized for over 100 years .
as a nation we have to spend money wisely and efficiently .
all it takes is the political will .
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen
what does the fact that these premiums will increase about 73 percent over the next six years mean in terms of disposable income for people ?
i ask my NDP colleagues for their support .

two days ago an open line show was conducted in my riding of Dawson Creek .
the Deputy Speaker :
to keep those principles alive .
the deal would have created 4,000 person years in new , high paid technology driven jobs .
it is the only question they have asked since the beginning -
i brought this to the attention of the Minister of Health in my first week in this House .
all the more so that there is presently in my riding a hotly debated issue which could literally burn the Liberal government since it could involve once more , influence peddling and partisanship in its organization .
because of the Conservatives ' successive restrictions on unemployment insurance and the Liberals ' employment insurance reform , fewer young people are able to take advantage of this program .
Mr. Speaker , let us not exaggerate things here .
i would be curious to know what my hon. friend says to new Canadians who are applying to have relatives , friends and extended families come to Canada and have to pay these exorbitant head taxes now as a result of the taxes imposed by his government on new Canadians .
i think it is important that they read it for themselves rather than listen to our colleagues across the way who somewhat filter it .
i would also like to comment on some of my hon. colleague ' s remarks regarding the National Forum on Health .
all members would agree that the 14.2 percent is much too high a burden to ask current workers to pay to fund their future pension entitlements .
madam Speaker , the member made specific reference to the loss of his son but he talked about the particular offender in that regard , and a peculiar gap in the law .
why ?
questions and comments .
members opposite probably think this is frivolous , that money should have been given to higher income groups through rate reductions rather than by helping people to get the opportunity to better their positions in our society .
it is a message that in our world will continue to resonate loudly and will no doubt serve as her lasting legacy .
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
this is perhaps one of the most important issues in our country ' s history .
* * *
pardon me , but does this government expect a great influx of EI claimants ?
we have a senior Quebec fundraiser in the Liberal Party who is now under criminal investigation for trying to shake down companies that are applying for government grants .
the corporation is to be managed by a board of 12 directors to be appointed by the federal government on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance , who in turn is to be advised on these appointments by a committee of representatives to be designated by provincial finance ministers , whose primary interest in this whole scheme is not pensions but access to the capital to be managed by the board .
the government continues to show a lack of commitment to British Columbia .
introduction and first reading
not only is this businessman being overtaxed , he is being literally fleeced and taken for a ride by the very people who manage his taxes .
while some scientists and environmentalists have developed models that imply a link between rising greenhouse gas emissions and global warming , not all scientists subscribe to this theory .
any development needs a second look , and should involve the local people .
justice
my question is this :
since the CWB is a multibillion dollar enterprise , the amounts outstanding under these guarantees are often very large .
again , let us just pose a question rhetorically , will people receiving death benefits get a better deal in the future ?
i can tell you that , after 25 years of an employment insurance system that did not keep up with changes in the job market , it was imperative that it be reviewed , upgraded and brought up to date because it served Canadians very poorly .
we care about the debt and we care about taxes .
policing OF AIRPORTS
madam Speaker , as long as I have more than five seconds .
my colleague , the leader of the opposition , pointed out this morning in the debate the ways in which the government is eroding the retirement security of seniors .
we tax workers in B.C. , transfer their money to Ottawa where it gets shuffled around by the bureaucrats and then it gets dumped into a program for infrastructure and gets sent back to B.C. again where it gets shuffled around and handed out under the grants program .
denominational education has been very important to the people .
my fellow citizens who still had any doubt could see in this speech that the Liberals have dropped the commitment they made in the 1995 referendum to recognize Quebec as a distinct society .
we forgive him in retrospect .
harmonization is a totally different topic .
hon. David M. Collenette
again this past weekend - and I will conclude on that - former Liberal Party leader Claude Ryan raised serious doubts .
he proposed that the other half be invested in addressing the social and economic needs of Canadians .
bill C - 2 - Notice of Motion for Time Allocation
hon. Sheila Copps ( for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 6 , an act to provide for an integrated system of land and water management in the Mackenzie Valley , to establish certain boards for that purpose and to make consequential amendments to other acts .
what are the options ?
the petitioners ask that the Food and Drugs Act be amended so that the term " foods for special health uses " includes any food expected to have a specific effect on the promotion of health or the prevention of disease , and that the Government of Canada may not limit the quantity of any vitamin , mineral , amino acid or other nutrient in a food simply because it exceeds the amount deemed necessary or useful .
* * *
that means that grains can now be added or included as opposed to what was in Bill C - 72 when they could only be deleted or excluded .
- privy Council , Vote 25
section 5 ( 1 ) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act provides that : " The Governor in Council may appoint an officer , to be known as the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , who , under the direction of the Minister - that is the Solicitor General - has the control and management of the Force and all matters connected therewith '' .
which other ministers of this government were aware of the events ?
we are encouraging him to re - think it all the way back to the federal party .
this new law will also empower producers to determine democratically what is and what is not under the Canadian Wheat Board ' s marketing jurisdiction .
we must also ensure that they have access to education .
we know that now .
if we look at the facts the vast majority of first nations are accountable .
many things were said , but I can think of two essential points : first , all the allusions made in the two previous throne speeches of the Liberals to devolution , change , respect and realignment of federal - provincial powers have disappeared .
yes , my dear colleagues , those whose job it is to try to tell the truth as they see it , rather than the members of the opposition , who are here to try to embarrass the government and to try to do you know what .
if he fails to hold an inquiry , his portfolio will soon be reduced to the minister of oceans .
it was not lists but proposals that I forwarded to ministers and individual members .
it is a relief also to hear that the people of Quebec have shown in most recent polls they would rather accept the declaration worked out in Calgary than separate .
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) :
it is beautiful country .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to table a petition that deals with the national highway system .
does it have to do with self - interest or an academic qualification ?
Quebec is not defending the principle of provincial autonomy because a principle is involved , but for the more important reason that it views autonomy as the concrete condition not for its survival , which is henceforth assured , but for its affirmation as a people '' .
if so , I will inform the hon. Leader of the Opposition .
i welcome them to the House .
she talked about shameful .
we represent 60 per cent of the members from Quebec , and we have a sovereignist government in Quebec City with whom we share the same option and which holds 80 per cent of the seats there .
it goes on to say that all decisions of this management committee will be in writing and shall be acted on only if they are unanimous .
it is similar to diverting a share of our national income toward education to ensure that we have an educated people .
Mr. Speaker , my Minister of Foreign Affairs has been in touch with the minister of foreign affairs of Israel who said that his country and his government regret very much the incident that occurred last week and that they will initiate discussions with this government to make sure that the same thing is not repeated in the future .
could the member clearly explain to the House how we can match tax breaks specifically to cover the rate increases without creating a significant charge against expenditures or increase the deficit ?
canada is a wonderful location , but I wonder sometimes if the government has actually examined some of the existing problems .
it must come to an end .
as a former teacher I can say that a hungry child is much more likely to be a problem learner with poor school performance .
therefore , I call upon the government to stop talking and start acting before it is too late .
it was not a simple consultative referendum as we were told .
let me ask him this and please come up with a better defence .
we shall invest in the creation of the head start program on reserves so that aboriginal children on reserves might have benefits that have been extended to others in the urban environment .
the Liberals take credit for this wee little turn in the graph .
the Speaker :
we argue it is time for the government to match its own words with its deeds .
some hon. members :
i have a stack of letters in my office from very pious , observant francophone Protestants who are concerned they will lose their own schools and no religion will be taught .
this is the basis of Confederation .
you cannot have Ontario with the priority of tax relief and the federal government having the priority to spend .
i would ask the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs if he intends to give the money for this new program to the Quebec government , as has been done with the loans and bursaries program for the past 30 years ?
that is a negative because the provinces , being able to borrow money at a lower rate , have built the country into a stronger place and have made investments for all of us across the board and helped strengthen the economy .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
call in the members .
he has already gone against the very principles of the quasi - judicial body he is talking about .
privilege
we should all keep in mind that we need to be courteous to one another .
we set aside October 1 to increase public awareness of the tremendous contributions older Canadians continue to make to Canadian society .
i had a number of projects in my riding and I can testify to their impact on the development of young people .

Canadians told us quite frankly to treat them like members of the pension plan .
security guards and local police forces are not .
no , not about me , but that they will never make it .
Aha .
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to address my comments to the member and draw on what my colleague from Calgary Southwest said about job killing .
Ms. Alexa McDonough
i am giving him a second chance to correct things .
with a monopoly there must be openness .
we should have some apparatus in place that is an item that either labour or management can put in its tool box and require them to bargain this situation right down to the nitty - gritty .
Ms. Wendy Lill :
it would seem that yesterday we accomplished what we set out to do .
the vacuum is particularly noticeable in the area of cultural development .
perhaps that is not surprising .
they wanted me to come and not only hold the government accountable and hold other opposition parties accountable for their actions and their responsibilities , but also to work with them to find the solutions of today .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
creating Opportunity for Young Canadians
they need an opportunity to learn new skills such as literacy .

the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
striking the right balance between regulation for safety and choice is something we will work toward .
Mr. Speaker , I would first like to congratulate you on your appointment .
the bills which are introduced in the Senate are not introduced that way to this body .
i would now like to address my Canadian friends in their own language , if I may .
that means retirement pensions are going to be drawn for longer periods of time .
Mr. Speaker , it would be funny if it were not so sad that the Liberal Party initiated the investigation a long time before the campaign started in late April .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
how can a member of any of the 18 standing committees be reasonably expected to have access to independent legal advice concerning the probable effect of specific sections of bills before a committee when no legal counsel is available ?
Mr. Nelson Riis
in other words , it seems that the " two solitudes " of Hugh McLellen are still evident .
these things are not true .
it directly affects their livelihood and you do not undertake changes to such a program without careful consideration and consultation within that community .
with the possible exception of the so - called inclusion clause , there is not a lot of substance to those amendments .
hon. David Anderson
hon. Sergio Marchi ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
the Speaker
eighty per cent of our trade is going to the U.S. We are especially very heavily taxed in comparison with the U.S.
Mr. Paul Forseth
Mr. Howard Hilstrom
i am not exactly sure what the member ' s question is regarding the justice system so I am afraid I will have to ask for clarification , if the hon. member wants to do so .
unanimous consent has not been achieved .
i cannot wait for Wednesday .

anyway , we got to Vancouver and that Christmas my mother received a turkey from her local church group .
* * *
does the fact that her government refused to repeal section 745 not put the judgments and the sentencing of today ' s -
yes , sir .
as said in the Speech from the Throne , it is our responsibility to ensure that no Canadian is left behind as the country moves forward .
but now , we have a similar system .
the problem seems to be that government is paying more attention to what the bureaucrats and foreign politicians are saying in the United Nations than what parents are saying here at home .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
in that ruling he stated :
i think that this kind of checking is what makes our system so strong .
i will review the approval process on the amount obtained from the transitional job fund .
we are saying that if we stop to ask instructions that the public has good sense of where a united Canada lies .
Rosh Hashanah , the Jewish new year , marks the beginning of a Holy week culminating with Yom Kippur , the Day of Atonement .
is the Liberal government once again going to abandon the cultural sector ?
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) :
we know that a variety of services are needed to address the challenges facing low skilled and low educated youth to give them a better chance .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel :
he said " No , it is at Charlottetown . "
canada is served well by its public service , and the effort and dedication it exhibits in meeting the needs of citizens and in building partnerships among governments and other sectors of society .
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu 茅 bec , BQ ) :
during my 13 years in the Newfoundland House of Assembly there were a couple of occasions on which I found myself in that kind of spot .
the refitting of the Spirit of Columbus platform would immediately create 400 jobs .
Mr. Speaker , I will even concede to the hon. member that payroll taxes do have an impact on job creation .
now for the very first time with the creation of the new federal riding of Thornhill , Markham , Vaughan , Concord and all of the wonderful communities within those entities have come together under the name of Thornhill .
i spoke earlier about the family .
i happen to be rising pursuant to a question I asked the Minister for International Trade about the multilateral agreement on investment , which has everything to do with what the hon. member for Malpeque was just talking about , that is , restricting the power of government even further than the power of national governments have already been restricted by the various free trade agreements which the government has already entered into .
Mr. Speaker , it was a pleasure to listen to the speech by the hon. member who is a dairy farmer .
he was a decorated war veteran who served in both England and France .
four years ago his leader stood in the House and asked the Conservative government why it always sided with the multinationals instead of with the people who need drugs .
let us eliminate this monkey business and give Canadian small businesses the fighting chance they deserve .
* * *
we were all treated to that terrible travesty of justice recently where Clifford Olson was brought into our living rooms by television and other means to plead his case for early parole .
situations like that force the families of victims of violence - in particular murder victims - into the civil courts which is something that we really do not feel they should have to go .
i do not believe that our deficit problem is a result of overspending on social programs .
i will have to tell them that we are looking at legislation that will result in diminishing their pensions .
the town of Dunnville is located on the Lake Erie shore and is dissected by the friendly Grand River .
people of my age will forever have to work harder and longer to get less , keep less and earn less .
Mr. Peter MacKay
we are looking forward to a renewal of the Canadian federation with a consideration for equality , not only equality of the citizens but equality of the provinces .
they take their politics seriously .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
nearly 30 years ago I became an adopted son of this country believing I was to begin a new life for my family and myself .
the hon. member wants to do so , but I am not sure the Chair will allow him to .
they spoke about the throne speech which was about vision , hope and confidence .
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
what is in the throne speech is a crack the size of the Grand Canyon .
however , retirement pensions for future beneficiaries would change since the calculation would be based on five years of maximum pensionable earnings instead of the current three years .
madam Speaker , I do not know what citation of Beauchesne ' s says so , but there is one that says it is forbidden to use props like that during a speech .
the Reform Party has come up with a very credible alternative to the government proposal .
we all know that investments in the well - being of today ' s children improve the long term health of the nation .
it reflects no policy position whatsoever of the government .
when an employer through a payroll deduction makes a contribution to the CPP he is making an investment in the country for sure but also in the workers who work for him .
in Ontario the present restructuring is putting at risk the high quality care that Canadians wear as a badge of honour .
last week I announced that we are undertaking a broad and very public re - evaluation of the way in which the health protection branch does its job .
of course , a lot of other products have to go to port .
our caucus opposes this .
they could come into effect within a year .
the throne speech calls for innovation and stimulation of the entrepreneurial spirit in Canada .

this system is designed to fail in the global economy .
that party did not succeed very well in the election of 1993 .
CANADIAN ECONOMY
statements BY MEMBERS
we are not where we want to be but we are heading in the right direction .
Mr. Bryon Wilfert
some know what impact sun and rain has on tourism in the Atlantic .
that will mean a constitutional amendment which will wipe out , not adjust , the rights of certain classes of people in Newfoundland to education in their particular school system .
our Challenge for the Future
the student connection program hires university and college students to teach small businesses how to use the Internet because everybody needs to get on line and it takes time and effort for each of these businesses to do what has to be done in the new economy .
our purpose must now be to take advantage of a vigorous economy and create jobs .
i will try to be brief .
it is important also that we support other industries .
that is pretty democratic in my estimation .
the 1997 budget included measures designed to increase federal support for post - secondary education by approximately $ 137 million to make post - secondary education more accessible to young people .
there will be changes to allow more flexibility in wheat board operations and improvements in cash flow .
if Canadians like you were to show the same understanding for the history and destiny of the people of Quebec , I think it would be easier for all concerned .
it is an example that can be multiplied in other parts of country .
family Kartways , North America ' s largest go - kart facility , and the renowned Cullen Gardens are just two of the many tourist draws .
let me tell you , the day is not far off when the Liberals are going to start talking about the sovereignty of Canada .
when we hear , as we did again this weekend , major political personages from the rest of Canada saying that the Calgary declaration is unacceptable to the rest of Canada , the implication is that , yet again , the road of renewed federalism is a dead end .
what is more compelling is that even since the moratorium was announced in July 1992 , this government , being in power now for four years , has not developed or implemented a strategy or a plan to deal with 35,000 to 40,000 Atlantic Canadians after May 1998 .
some of them changed sides , and he is one of them .
it is this type of Liberal - Tory hypocrisy which breeds voter cynicism .
the Speaker :
it is quite obvious I agree with that .
resuming debate , the hon. member for Qu ' Appelle .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien
death from drug overdoses is the number one killer for men and women aged 30 to 44 .
collective bargaining talks between the Canada Post Corporation and the postal workers ' union are breaking down , as was unfortunately hoped by the minister responsible for Canada Post .
it is a worthwhile piece of legislation which will ensure greater representation for western producers , and we are pleased to see a measure which will benefit other Canadian provinces .
as everyone is well aware , what we representatives of the Bloc Quebecois want is a country for the year 2000 .
these are no small amounts we are talking about .
fire PREVENTION
with regard to international trade , the Speech from the Throne addressed four key elements .
i would like to tell them that we all remember him very well .
that is a positive feature of the legislation .
thus British Columbia ' s under - representation in this House would be even more significant .
* * *
the member for Charlotte has the floor .
* * *
i cannot think of another circumstance when it has been clearer what producers want .
companies will need to work in consultation with the government to ensure that policies such as lifetime product stewardship have appropriate phase in periods to allow for the necessary design changes .
money in an organization may be used in many different ways .
as the former chairman of the Waterloo regional police , I know firsthand that these children often start down the path of delinquency and end up as young offenders or worse .
i am a man who said the right thing .
we have an ever increasing number of homeless people that we can see as we walk down the streets of Ottawa in a highly industrial and technological society .
we would really like to have copies of those progress reports .
for many Canadians this will be the straw which breaks their financial back .
all its major initiatives will serve to make Canada better and thus more united .
they all have one specific thing in common , that the demographics of our country are changing very rapidly to the point where if we want to understand the full impact of this issue we also have to start by understanding and recognizing that in this country today , for every person who is of retirement age there are five people who are working .
did it ever exist ?
supreme COURT OF CANADA
i get so tired of the rhetoric that we hear on the issue .
some hon. members :
later , Jean Lesage spoke of two founding peoples .
we have seen that frustration in every region of this country .
he cannot cut the provinces by 35 per cent and then sit at the same table and say to them " I will run the show '' .
the new west is exercising new muscles and energy , not simply to get its old grievances addressed , but by offering a new source of hope and energy to unify our country and strengthen our economy .
i wonder if he is aware of the fact that the average level of education for these people is about grade six .
( d ) Justice and Human Rights shall include , among other matters , the review and report on reports of the Canadian Human Rights Commission , which shall be deemed permanently referred to the Committee immediately after they are laid upon the Table ;
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) :
the minister has done a superb job and is to be congratulated .
expert analysis has shown us that the rules of our plan need to be updated to reflect the realities of today ' s world as well as tomorrow ' s .
he is hedging , he is lagging , he is dragging his feet just like before the last referendum .
health
the hon. Minister of Finance had the foresight to move the issue forward and resolve the problem 20 years in advance .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Calgary Southwest , Ref. ) :
in 1996 the banks gave a total of $ 544,000 plus to the Liberal Party .
if the Parliament of Canada approves the amendment sought by the Quebec assembly , it will be declaring that these last four subsections just quoted pertaining to the rights , powers , privileges and duties of the denominational schools do not apply to Quebec .
Mrs. Carolyn Parrish ( Mississauga Centre , Lib . ) :
outside of the unity debate there is probably not a more important issue that the government will deal with in its mandate , yet it has decided to shut Canadians out of the process .
we see that under the guise of protecting Canadian culture , it is attempting to define and impose it .
i must confess that it is with some pride that I rise today in this House as the new Liberal member for Bourassa .
naturally , the minister took the trouble to write to Mr. Murray of the RCMP to ask that the matter be investigated .
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia )
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the speech made by the hon. member opposite , and remember previous speeches of his .
i take personal pride that Filipino Canadians are in the forefront of this volunteerism .
mockery and travesty come to mind .
it is an important opportunity for Canadians to consider whether the income splitting of their pensions will reduce the tax burden on the family .
yes , I believe the governments did .
unfortunately my riding , like many other ridings and communities in Canada , is also living the consequences of federal Liberal policies of continuing high unemployment especially among youth and aboriginal peoples , of growing poverty , homelessness and inadequate housing .
my dear colleague , you must not refer to hon. members by name , but by riding .
i held a forum on aboriginal justice issues during the third week of August in Fredericton .
inter - PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION
Canadians know that they can no longer count on the federal government for everything .
my caucus invites this government to honour that spirit , to learn from it and to unleash it to build the country we all know Canada can be .
on the contrary , while it opened some initial doors , it is interesting to find that our trade , especially our exports to countries like China , Hong Kong , India , Pakistan , Chile , Argentina and Uruguay just to mention a few , went down in subsequent years after the initial trade missions .
while it has not expressed itself on the means used , the assembly of Quebec bishops has nevertheless publicly supported the establishment of linguistic school boards and has not opposed amending section 93 .
Mr. Rick Borotsik
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi
if I heard concerns about the pension plan for the future they were to make sure that what Canada has such as the CPP and OAS will be there for us when we retire and for our children and our grandchildren .
it is a tax grab .
introduction and first reading
that is the direction we should not be going in .
who expect us to deliver
they are present here today in Ottawa as part of a special World War II radar reunion .
for most teachers it reaches into their lives through after school activities , volunteering as sports coaches , band leaders , drama coaches and social group co - ordinators .
this woman then took my mother down to the store and got another turkey for her and showed her how to cook it properly .
such an institute will focus on research and training so that our workforce skills are leading edge and we are prepared for the latest advancements in communications technology .
where is the acknowledgement and the recognition of the new west and what it brings to Canada ' s 21 st century ?
youth are an issue that is important to every Canadian and every member of this House .
Jordanian acquaintances told him there was talk of killing westerners .
i would like to add that I am somewhat surprised by the Reform amendment where it says that the system will be even more unfair to young people when in fact the proposed premium increase will come mainly from the pockets of the baby boomers , that is to say those who are presently aged between 40 and 55 , and I am one of them .
Ms. Marlene Catterall ( Ottawa West - Nepean , Lib . ) :
i am absolutely amazed the Leader of the Opposition should propose going into the Constitution again .
immigration
address IN REPLY
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) :
an example would be a resident of Hull who had worked all his or her life here in Ottawa .
we need more in my riding .
another area where police have said they need more and sharper tools is in the fight against organized crime .
QUEBEC ECONOMY
Mr. Speaker , I thank my hon. friend for the question .
how can the minister explain to Canadians that his department has not yet found one single solution to this problem ?
there are changes occurring in the workplace such as the use of overtime hours , the use of part time versus full time workers , more contract employees and there are many other trends .
the one time beauty of the country has been destroyed .
we are the highest taxed nation in the world , especially among the G - 7 countries .
it has nothing to do with our department ' s ability to refer to the auditor general ' s comments about the import and export of hazardous wastes and we will be doing everything to respond to the concerns raised by the auditor general .
not only are parental rights being undermined by implementing this UN convention , they are concerned it will create greater incentives for families to abdicate their parental responsibilities to the state .
let us ensure that this debate goes on long enough so that Canadian people will know that this plan is the second biggest tax grab in our country ' s history .
unfortunately a downward spiral of cynicism has gripped many .
my understanding is that an agreement has been reached .
resuming debate .
he said when he was elected as the leader of the Liberal Party that he was going to be there for 10 years and that was it .
when these workers collect their pension they will know it is their pension , not a government handout .
two initiatives from groups in the riding of L 茅 vis are similar .
after being in power for three and a half years the last time and being in power a long time before that , it is outrageous the Liberal government has done nothing to dismantle hundreds of trade barriers that exist between our provinces .
on their own it would appear not , but hopefully these initiatives will be viewed as a starting point to convince Quebeckers that Canadians from all across the country are prepared to resolve the country ' s unity problem within Confederation .
they reflected this in the last election by not only renewing our mandate but by sending the message to the Bloc Quebecois , because its numbers went from 54 to 44 .
the Speaker :
you probably recall the sorry state of the country ' s finances a mere four years ago .
since 1993 , the party and the government have boasted of their honesty and integrity : no scandal , clear sailing .
i believe the government has missed an opportunity to offer Canadians real leadership .
the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest , seconded by the hon. member for Haldimand - Norfolk - Brant , moved for leave to introduce a bill entitled an act to amend the Criminal Code and the Copyright Act ( profit from authorship respecting a crime ) .
the government must realize that it is women who are paying the price for the cuts made in recent years .
i am thinking of our unemployed , our seniors , our disadvantaged families .
Ms. Louise Hardy
while the prime minister and the minister of fisheries seem to be so caught up in remaining very friendly with the Americans , our own people are entering financial crisis .
Mr. Speaker , 10 years ago the Canada - U.S. Free Trade Agreement was concluded .
in the past they were based on a three year average .
i always found that Mr. Fraser and all those he taught , many of whom are here today , had that fairness and respect for all members of Parliament no matter what their politics .
i wanted to see why people who were my age , 50 years old , with two teenage daughters , who were established in life , would risk going down the road with the uncertainties which separation would bring .
Canadians will have an opportunity to continue to monitor what is going on with their Canada pension plan .
i would like him to expand on this issue where we have individuals who are law breakers , who are in process .
today I asked the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans if he would re - commit to a signed , written contract with the 40,000 fishers of Atlantic Canada and Quebec to maintain the income supplement program known as TAGS , for the fishers of those areas .
he did consultations with all provincial and territorial governments in trying to examine the direction we should go .
it is unfortunate they had to get up in the House and try to turn this motion around to make it look bad .
no level of unemployment is acceptable .
last Friday afternoon department officials explained why they had asked for the file in question .
i invite all Canadians to look at the facts , to review the evidence .
Mr. Speaker , I find the remark about my integrity a bit stupid in today ' s context .
aboriginal people themselves believe that we need a new relationship .
i will go on now to the affordability .
Mr. Monte Solberg
Mr. Ted McWhinney
it does bring a great deal of honour to the House to have people like you who have worked in Parliament and have done a great job in the past .
hon. Christine Stewart
foreign AFFAIRS
it is important for people watching the debate today to realize that those amendments are very superficial .
Wednesday , September 24 , 1997
the ultimate end of this would be to widen the gap between the rich and the poor , much of which would be done through tax funded support .
it therefore represents a majority of Quebecers .
the Liberals have presided over the highest level of unemployment in recent history .
supply
Mr. Speaker , I also add my congratulations to the NDP member on her first speech .
i am pleased with the government ' s commitment to this type of collaboration as I believe it is important for the government to address issues on local and regional levels with the assistance of supporting organizations , businesses and government services .
they will have more power to take on the very real challenges and opportunities that lie ahead .
however , I want to be on the record that I really think that some very important programs have been gutted , and I hate to say this because I have been part of a government that was a party to this .
Mr. Bill Blaikie
the bill should make it clear , which it does not , that the funds to be received and managed by the corporation are to be held and managed in trust for the workers and pensioners of this country .
many hon. members in this Chamber began their political careers in municipal government .
Mr. Speaker , as the Minister of Transport stated to the hon. member in question period on September 26 , under the Constitution of Canada responsibility for highways , including highway 104 in Nova Scotia , falls under provincial jurisdiction .
when I was re - elected this past June 2 , I was mindful of the responsibility that the people of Oxford had once again given me .
recently the international leader of the Salvation Army , General Paul A . Rader , conferred on the member for Saint John the Order of Distinguished Auxiliary Service .
Beryl Gaffney remains a source of inspiration to those who confront serious illness .
the auditor general has mentioned it in his reports a number of times , but the government has done nothing about it .
specifically , if they get a handle on government spending and quit spending more and more and more , they will be able to devote more money to the programs Canadians really care about .
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) :
hon. Allan Rock
the challenges of Quebeckers and Canadians will then be nation building , affirming the unique personalities of their two countries , and union building that is defining their common destiny within a novel body politic .
we would have had a bill expressly recognizing equality of citizens of provinces and applying that principle to the exercise of the federal spending and taxation power .
i can see how this would concern the Bloc leader .
Mr. Speaker , the matter to which the hon. member refers is before a quasi - judicial review board .
needless to say , I support this very worthwhile effort .
this will allow us to have more debate and more interchange .
i think it is important to reiterate our deep attachment to the anglophone community .
today , that company finds itself tainted by association , because of a Liberal party fundraiser , and because of information leaked to him by someone with access to it , which has complicated things enormously .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member will know that one of the key priorities this government has chosen in its mandate is to work with provincial partners and others to create a coherent national children ' s agenda to improve the plight of children across the country .
* * *
as part of denturist awareness month denturists are seeking to encourage and facilitate the standardization of education among their colleagues and to make the public more aware of their commitment to providing the best services available to Canadians in need of oral health care .
they will ensure the school boards provide the minority with an equitable distribution of human , material and financial resources .
let us move ahead with this bill .
can the President of the Treasury Board confirm that Mr. Roy told him that ?
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard
Mr. Speaker , we made frequent reference in the Speech from the Throne to the partnership we want with the provinces .
we in the NDP are committed to ensuring that is ended and ceilings are put on contributions by those organizations .
i remember Meech Lake very well .
Mr. Speaker , the member spoke about things he is concerned about in the plan .
we made it possible to obtain DNA samples from suspects in crimes of physical violence .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
* * *
* * *
is the member allowed to mention that ?
that is why we have committed to work with the provinces to redesign the vocational rehabilitation of disabled persons program so that it does what it is supposed to do , give Canadians with disabilities a greater opportunity to participate in the workforce .
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
it is appropriate that a Liberal government will lead the country into the next millennium .
Mr. Preston Manning
sitting RESUMED
a high level of investment , excellence in education , accelerated innovation through science and technology and an increased emphasis on the commercialization of science and technology , will spur job creation and generate increases in the standard of living for Canadians .
that is precisely the reason we have sent members of Parliament information packages , briefed our trade critics , offered briefings to our caucuses , as well as indicated to -
the Minister of Industry must realize that they will have difficulty finding partners who could make contributions equal to 50 percent or 60 percent of the funding from the foundation .
organizations throughout the western world are making their organizations flatter by eliminating levels of management and by redesigning , re - engineering and rightsizing , as the term is used , their structure .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
does he think there are no needs in these areas , that we should not be investing in children , in health ?
if the member has more facts , table them in the House .
within months of getting through Parliament it is being challenged in Alberta because it defies natural justice .
it is obvious today that those Liberals do not believe that .
canada PENSION PLAN
this attitude is obvious in the government ' s throne speech .
Mr. Randy White
in addition , the principle followed by the Liberals with regard to premiums is simple : hold the line on premiums but cut back on accessibility .
these are words that we did not hear in the speech from the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon .
i earlier indicated my commitment to involve communities in the issue of crime prevention .
Mr. John Reynolds
that rebalanced relationship is very important to where these benefits are going and what is happening .
it got struck off the register .
one particular area of interest to me is the creation of greater opportunities for physically and mentally challenged Canadians through wage subsidies and job creation initiatives .
almost 100 years ago , Sir Wilfrid Laurier said , " The 20 th century shall be the century of Canada and of Canadian development . "
Mr. Carmen Provenzano
business dynamics of cities have changed since then .
it is either one way or the other .
the plain truth of the matter is that citizens look to their political leaders for a cure to these ills of our society .
it has had very progressive legislation for many years , such as the anti - scab legislation , and the new equity legislation passed by the Quebec National Assembly , which will apply to all private sector enterprises , a first in North America and perhaps in the world .
all these investments being announced in Quebec ' s areas of jurisdiction , after what they did to Quebec ' s public finances in particular , have been in the works since March 1996 .
i have a question about the transitional jobs fund , the $ 300 million kitty that the federal government doles out with special attention to Liberal ridings .
while progress has been made in lowering the deficit , it has come at the expense of jobs through higher taxes .
does the government have credibility on the jobs issue ?
the Deputy Speaker :
the people of Duplessis withstood the Liberals ' blackmail and threats during this campaign .
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to our standing orders , I am pleased to table the letter which was referred to earlier today .
there is another piece of information for the prime minister ' s attention when he says that the Charlottetown accord would have elected senators .
* * *
i am pleased that the House is getting around to considering this matter in a serious fashion .
this is why , we are providing , through programs such as our internship program and our summer student employment initiative , work experience for over 100,000 young Canadians , to make it easier for them to find permanent jobs .
the bottom line is they cannot have it all ways .
when claiming that a certain action constitutes a breach of privilege , members must specify which of these privileges is affected .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member for Algoma referred to the strong voice of the government that is there for the people .
what did we do ?
in fact , 25 percent of child protection cases in Nova Scotia are in Dartmouth .
we of the South Shore make much of our living from primary industries .
at the beginning of the century Laurier dreamed of that future when he said :
Mr. Speaker , it is with a great deal of honour that I rise to address this House for the first time , to rise from the seat that belongs to the citizens of the constituency of Lethbridge .
Mr. Speaker , as a result of the change in the plan whereby it will be invested in the markets by a private sector investment board at arm ' s length from government , it is fully expected that the plan will in fact have a return commensurate with any private sector plan .
since this morning , the Bloc has been making all kinds of allegations against one person or another , sometimes even against constituents of ridings represented by Bloc members or other parties .
government EXPENDITURES
speech FROM THE THRONE
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
when I was relatively young , the Trudeau government appointed the Cr 茅 ditiste member for the riding of Richmond - Arthabaska , my friend Lionel beaudoin , to the Canadian Wheat Board .
the polls clearly demonstrate that Quebecers have Canadian values at heart and want to remain within the country they helped build .
why not at least let them get a maximum return while still protecting the current beneficiaries ?
the member spoke about giving and sharing rather than calculating what we can get from society .
it will work directly with other countries to enhance and promote human rights , peace building and democracy .
let us not fail at this critical time .
i did not see it .
Mr. Chuck Strahl
we were not pseudo - conservatives as others would have you believe , we were true liberals .
however , there are areas where the powers of the national government must be strengthened because it is not by stripping the federal government of all its responsibilities that we will keep the country united .
it affects their job .
would it not be the case that instead of offering women half a loaf , this government would have said that before it considers spending $ 12.2 million on bonuses for senior civil servants , it will ensure it meets its obligations and ensures equal pay for work of equal value ?
the second major change in Bill C - 4 is the provision that allows for the inclusion or exclusion of grains under the Canadian Wheat Board ' s mandate .
again the member for Calgary Southwest missed the point .
middle class workers cannot afford to pay more , and I know that because I had a young mother come to me just last week .
they have to be prepared to learn throughout their lives .
i will tell you what book it is .
if my colleague from Bourassa were more concerned about the interests of Quebec , he would encourage the Minister of Finance to give Quebec its due and would stop saying just any old thing .
i believe they had a fiscal dilemma on their hands .
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
in addition , there are enormous implications for the proposed Canada pension plan investment board and it needs to be thoroughly thought through .
Mr. Bouchard , it is not too late to transform this political mission aimed at promoting partition into a genuine economic mission .
JEWISH COMMUNITY
that is why the modernization of Canada ' s social union is in the immediate best interests of Quebeckers and Canadians alike .
dear Mr. Price ,
another problem is the whole issue of survivor and death benefits .
it is very much appreciated and I take it to heart .
i also want to congratulate our Speaker .
after experiencing hardships , racial discriminations , Sikhs and people of South Asian origin should be commended for their openness , success and contributions to Canada .
perhaps some would say that dry bones are enough .
as a province we extended to the Pentecostal Assemblies of Newfoundland and Labrador rights under the Constitution of Canada that they would be able to have their own particular school system .
federal DETENTION CENTRES
in the right regulatory and business environment , Canadians have no need to fear global competition .
right now the option of selling to the Canadian Wheat Board , the private trade or directly to the final customer exists , but only for domestic feed grain .
we went from Halifax at pier 21 by train all the way to Vancouver .
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan ( York North , Lib . ) :
no , it is not in a tax cut .
i believe that when we have that kind of experience we feel a sense of alienation from the very people who elected us , simply because we have a great regard for them .

the Speaker :
Mr. Speaker , it is an honour for me , as the member for Papineau - Saint - Denis , to take part in this debate on the throne speech that marks the beginning of our government ' s second term in office .
changes in the way benefits are calculated will slightly reduce the pensions of future beneficiaries , reduce the death benefit and make it harder to qualify for disabled benefits .
i also remind the hon. member that there was extensive debate province by province -
Mr. Peter Goldring ( Edmonton East , Ref. ) :
maybe the police will arrest him .
any direct payroll tax as substantial as employment insurance premiums is bound to kill employment .
the Government of Canada owes some 200,000 workers $ 2 billion .
the recommendations do not address the cuts to VIA maintenance in the last three years which have led to the closure of maintenance centres in Halifax and Toronto , the originating point of the train at Biggar .
these paragraphs apply to all provinces except Manitoba , Saskatchewan , Alberta and Newfoundland .
Mr. John Solomon :
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) :
he talked about jobs .
i am not going to dwell on that because everybody else has certainly beat that one to death .
Mr. Speaker , in view of national family week we recognize that nearly a million men came to the Washington , D . C . mall on Saturday to publicly state their promise to take greater responsibility toward their community , church , workplace and , most important , their family .
increasing debt or the size of government and taxes only deprives young people of work .
( division 5 )
we , the collective members of the House of Commons and the representatives of us , the 30 million Canadians , thank you and all those you represent for showing us that there is a powerful sense of community in Canada and for reminding us that when it really counts we are there for each other .
i would agree with him .
we believe it will provide additional well - being and economic independence .
good projects are part of the role of a good member of Parliament .
national HIGHWAYS
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
i can assure the hon. member who just spoke that if the RCMP find in their wisdom , and if it is confirmed by a court later that there was influence peddling , I will be as concerned as he is , and I should be .
however , I have made it very clear that I see merit in ensuring that there is a wider consultation process in relation to the appointment of supreme court justices .
i would like to hear the views of Reform members on this issue .
as a long - time member of the Royal Canadian Legion he served as branch president , provincial president , grand patron and a life member of the St. Machar Masonic Lodge , Aberdeen , Scotland .
then they need their first job break .
hon. Herb Gray
Mr. Speaker , when did the government become afraid of the 301 members elected to represent -
( d ) Citizenship and Immigration ( sixteen Members ) ;
Mrs. Monique Guay :
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
the hon. member for Qu ' Appelle laid out comments about each of the initiatives the government is proposing to deal with the need to get the cost of the CPP down .
on behalf of all Canadians , I congratulate Mr. Campbell for the altruism he has shown in contributing to the economic development of Thailand .
as a member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development , I shall make it my duty , along with my colleagues , to ensure that all the reforms will apply equally to the coming generations and that everyone will be able to benefit from these services .
perhaps we should all sit in a circle and try to move this group of warring factions into some unity .
my expenses for the June 2 election have already been tabled .
Tuesday , September 23 , 1997
we are known for our Canadian values , generosity of spirit and collective action ; values which have set us apart in the areas of health care , foreign affairs and peacekeeping ; all those characteristics which lend to our pride in our country and the respect of the maple leaf worldwide .
madam Speaker , I thank the member for his question .
agreed .
member FOR SURREY CENTRAL
i believe that the hon. member ' s party has been instrumental in improving that ratio .
anybody who thinks they can is not looking at reality .
this three pronged approach has proven successful .
i am new to this debate .
the polls are reflecting it .
i am sure she probably feels the same about agriculture .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
the Speech from the Throne sets out the broad lines of our strategy for our second mandate .
Fiona Reid was nominated for outstanding performance by a female for her performance in the Canadian Stage Company ' s production of " Arcadia '' .
resumption of Debate on Address in Reply
after going door to door during the campaign I call Albert County the forgotten land .
( on motion of Mr. Manning the debate was adjourned )
admittedly they do not have old age security or the GIS .
he launched into a debate that was completely off topic .
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
second , to express my disappointment that the bill before us is such a pale and timid imitation of what is required to prepare the Canadian Wheat Board and to equip Canadian grain growers to succeed in the 21 st century .
we probably if we are lucky get back 50 cents on every dollar to actually spend on the infrastructure .
this impossible tax burden on small businesses has an extremely detrimental effect on job creation .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew :
i obtained 64 % of the vote thanks to a fine team that stuck with me throughout the campaign , which led to a great victory on June 2 .
madam Speaker , I have not yet finished answering the question .
Mr. Speaker , one wonders whether the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs lives in Quebec .
as a mother of two young girls this issue is of utmost importance to me personally and I believe to all my colleagues in the House .
international DAY OF OLDER PERSONS
in the name of intergenerational equity espoused by the member for Calgary Southeast , their fresh start on pensions is a false start for young Canadians .
- any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament in the performance of its functions , or which obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the discharge of his duty , or which has a tendency , directly or indirectly , to produce such results may be treated as contempt , even though there is no precedent for the offence .
he was elected in 1953 and again in 1957 .
a joint report has recently indicated that we have a lot further to go , that we must continue to reduce those emissions by as much as up to 75 percent .
many of my constituents have very real concerns about the present state and future of our medicare system .
if they succeed they are then hit with premiums , levies and taxes on the employees they try to hire to help them produce more .
you still haven ' t replied .
is that something that the hon. member does not stand for ?
government ORDERS
frankly that is a fairer way to do it than to turn a blind eye and leave it to the next generation to worry about .
we are happy and honoured to be in the House to offer our contribution to the national debate .
Mr. John Nunziata ( York South - Weston , Ind . ) :
Mr. Wayne Easter
since its founding in 1935 , the Canadian Wheat Board has been able to return premiums to farmers through pooling and single desk selling .
the situation today is much better than when I became a member of Parliament .
both the series and the game were tied .
two of the people on the finance department ' s contract selection committee are senior Liberal Party workers .
the 27 th Parliament introduced full health insurance to Canada .
the Reform Party should also acknowledge that for the first time Premier Klein is actually saying that there is a role for government and that government needs to invest in the future of Albertans , in his particular case .
yes , I agree that the time has come that maybe we should have an elected Senate .
Mr. Ellis is survived by his wife Bessie , three sons and one daughter .
the Reform Party is afraid to state that its plan does not hold water .
it appears that the Canadian Judicial Council depended solely on the word of Chief Justice Isaac who told them among other things that he never discussed Judge Jerome recusing himself from the cases , although the justice documents say exactly the opposite .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
the Speaker :
Mr. Speaker , I too want to pay tribute to the member for Nunavut .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay
on April 14 , 1987 Speaker Fraser felt it necessary to make this comment to the House on this very same issue :
i hoped to hear about commitment to act against violence against women or to hear that the government is going to introduce a national child care program so often promised by the Liberals , or for any indication that the government might finally embark on a campaign of fair taxation to ensure that the vast wealth in this country is something that benefits all Canadians .
routine PROCEEDINGS
i say with a great deal of satisfaction that we can look as an example to how the province of Quebec has used its investments with very clear direction to its management board as to how these funds ought to be utilized to the best benefit of Quebec business again with job creation as a major function of these investments .
did it just hit the minister that something might be wrong as the clock struck midnight ?
it is not there .
i know the hon. member realizes he is not to express his agreement or disagreement with the petitions he tables .
that is why since taking office as the minister there are three things I have done .
royal CANADIAN LEGION
presence IN THE GALLERY
the amendment came to the House of Commons .
Mr. Speaker , the analysis is well known .
madam Speaker , I want to comment on some of the remarks by the hon. member , some of which were regrettably partisan , to the Speech from the Throne .
as is our practice on Wednesday we will now sing O Canada , and we will be led by the hon. member for Souris - Moose Mountain .
as we speak the Government of Canada and the Government of the Northwest Territories are training Inuit to staff Nunavut ' s public service .
law ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
if the notion of forgetting about the fiscal framework of this country creeps back in , then we will have higher interest rates which will hurt us when we are trying to get jobs going .
a motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved .
it is indeed an honour and a privilege to represent them in the House of Commons .
it says wait and see about everything .
its members made it very clear that they would see it destroyed .
we need to meet today ' s economic and demographic demands .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
we must turn lethargy into energy .
it is also a nation whose people are connected to each other .
the challenge facing Canada is of significant proportions and warrants all our energies and creativity .
there was not only political interference , the judicial process was stopped completely and Canadians were denied the full facts and truth about the horrible wrongdoing and cover - up within the Canadian military .
Mr. Bill Casey
we know that the issue is delicate , that Israel and Canada are strong allies economically , culturally , politically , and of course allies in the fight against international terrorism .
next weekend I will be sitting down with my dad who is in his late 90 s and my mother who is in her late 80 s .
those gambling casinos will have dice games .
but what did they do when in government ?
he wants to do the right thing .
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister uses the term " partners " because he thinks it is a popular term and would give it the same meaning it was given by the sovereignists .
unfortunately , that is what we have come to .
that is probably the reason why there are no mines on his list .
i do not think she does it out of malice but , rather , out of separatist idealism to try to make a point .
he said that extensive consultations had already taken place regarding the legislation .
i wonder if he knows the policies of his own party .
if , for some reason , they get off on the wrong foot we are there to make sure they have a second and a third chance if necessary .
on his arrival in France for a so called economic mission , the first thing he did when he got out of the plane was to talk to the French about separation again .
the people of Thornhill are very aware that there are problems with the Canada pension plan .
indeed , I will be able to tell my children that I was part of the last group of Quebec MPs elected to the House of Commons .
i would like to thank the voters of Edmonton North , the new constituency in which I ran in this past election .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
the riding of Parkdale - High Park , a microcosm of Canada , is one of the most culturally and economically diverse ridings in this country .
perhaps I have already exceeded my time .
* * *
the third step I took was to prepare a consultation document to involve all Canadians , not just one or two in this discussion of the future of the health protection branch .
i would like to repeat my sincere thanks to my constituents for acknowledging and supporting the style and type of representation that I gave them in the 35 th Parliament .
my bill would strengthen the provisions of section 335 of the Criminal Code , a section under which young offenders are usually charged .
we are waiting for the position of the Ontario government .
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
this does not serve the best interests of Canadian consumers .
another reason for the extended time period is to ensure that the committee has sufficient time to consider the three tests for such a proposed constitutional amendment , as delineated earlier by the leader of the opposition .
the official involved acted prudently by not revealing confidential information without seeking legal advice .
it is important to also acknowledge the helping hand the Saguenay region received during the flood .
the Liberal government ' s action plan is based on our highest priority , employment , that is to make sure that this good health is also reflected in the quality of life of all our citizens .
it is very interesting to be in the 36 th Parliament because we have another group of parliamentarians at this end of the House who stand day after day and say that all spending by government is good .
* * *
i would like to , on behalf of all the constituents , thank him for the job he did while he was here .
it is particularly difficult to ensure that young people who want to continue to learn have access to education .
Mr. Speaker , I am very proud to be here today .
justice
this increase will see the cash payment entitlements to the provinces and territories rise by $ 700 million in 1998 - 99 and $ 1.4 billion the year after .
we believe this gives the government too much control over a board of directors that should really be accountable ultimately to the farmers and it gives the government too much control over the day to day operations of the wheat board itself .
i address myself directly to the member for Burnaby - Douglas .
i have no difficulty in acknowledging that Quebec has a culture .
how does the hon. member believe his government can express that love and passion for Canadian unity through actions of fundamentally reforming the federation so that we do not hear the kind of remarks from Senator Carney and so we no longer have the presence of the secessionists in this great Chamber ?
is there anything in this throne speech about a national child care system ?
the Speaker :
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
it may be the most treasured passport in the entire world .
Mr. Speaker , I rise for the first time in this House .
Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) :
taxation
the government in the last couple of weeks has entered into agreements with those who have violated our fishing treaties and contracts to give those violators more fishing inside of the 200 - mile limit .
Intrawest president Joe Houssian said he was not worried about the political climate .
some hon. members :
i might add , if the Speaker says I have a couple of seconds , that in the last sentence -
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
this brings the total indebtedness and liability of younger Canadians to well over $ 1 trillion .
hon. Lawrence MacAulay
after all , that is what the House is dealing with .
Mr. Darrel Stinson :
Mr. Peter Mancini
it is the vision captured in the Speech from the Throne .
moreover - and the minister has highlighted this reality - the Government of Quebec is not seeking to root out religion from education but rather to secularize the administrative structures .
i am deeply offended that anyone would suggest that Mr. Justice Bastarache ' s service at that law firm would in some way disqualify this distinguished individual from his appointment to the -
* * *
i sat and watched an NDP government in Ontario take the total debt of that province from $ 39 billion in 1990 to over $ 100 billion in 1995 , which literally destroyed the confidence of one of our greatest provinces .
they want us to understand aboriginal health and the impact it is having on their communities .
not only does it affect workers .
there is ample opportunity for discussion in this House and there will be ample opportunity for continued discussion outside of this House , as every member of the government will be out in their constituencies consulting with their constituents , consulting with Canadians about the priorities and whether we have these priorities right and what we should be doing with our fiscal dividend when that dividend appears .
* * *
procedure AND HOUSE AFFAIRS
when I was canvassing during the election the households I visited in my riding often confronted me with various issues such as our pension system , our health system , our deficit , our job initiatives , crime issues , moral issues and issues such as the fiasco of topless women , which I might add I do not support and find unacceptable .
Mr. Bob Speller :
in all good faith , I would like to salute my opponents in the last election campaign , especially Cl 茅 ment Lajoie , the mayor of St. Bruno , a village in my riding , and Sabin Simard , the Conservative candidate .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
we work with other legislatures to make sure that legislation reflects the need to integrate people with this affliction into the community .
statements BY MEMBERS
this would perhaps be less disturbing if the government ' s track record in this area were not so disastrous .
we have built a country out of a harsh but bountiful land .
between 75 % and 80 % of farmers want to see some change which ranges from minor change to very substantive change .
to put my comments in context I have two sons in their twenties .
i would argue they deserve nothing less than a legal guarantee enshrined in law against future deficits .
i would also like to especially acknowledge and thank my hon. predecessor Mr. Jesse Flis who represented the riding of Parkdale - High Park for over 14 years .
my question for the prime minister is how is his shell game any different from Mulroney ' s shell game ?
so , as a government member , will the hon. member tell us whether Quebecers are a people , yes or no ?
i would like to take advantage of this opportunity to describe the situation .
on that occasion , it introduced a framework of voluntary measures in its national action plan regarding climate change in Canada .
the fourth tier they forgot to mention was the MP pension plan .
we are not wealthy or affluent communities .
that is something people will understand .
we must direct our attention to them and find solutions .
this is what Canadians elected us to do in 1993 and it is what they re - elected us to do this spring .
the legislation also provides for a contingency fund to manage risk consolidated with cash trading .
i want to thank the hon. member for bringing this matter to the attention of the House as well as the government House leader and the hon. member for Winnipeg - Transcona for the assistance they have given the Chair .
instead of increasing spending all the time when is the minister going to start lowering taxes ?
the problem is out of control in British Columbia .
last week , in Toronto , I took part in the march against AIDS and I met a number of those leading the fight in Toronto .
has he heard about the technology partnership programs where we assist businesses that want to be on the leading edge of the development of technology ?
it is growing and government members had better understand why it is growing .
in essence this bill is a further refinement of the previous Bill C - 72 of the last Parliament on which the agriculture committee held extensive hearings across the Canadian Wheat Board area .
at this point I am not sure whether the Speaker has all the information .
the social union is the ideal testing ground for our ability to work in partnership , modernize our programs , clarify the various roles played by the Government of Canada , share equitably our country ' s resources and strengthen our economic union .
part of the major debate that will go on in part two will be public pensions versus private pensions .
oaths OF OFFICE
either that is true or our foreign affairs department is inept .
but let us take a closer look at that fiscal and economic record .
sometimes as Reformers we talk a lot about the means but not so much about the end which is vitally important to all of us .
that is what we intend to do .
tobacco ACT
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for the number of questions contained in his statement .
how can this member claim success for the government ' s fiscal policies when what it is doing is arranging to spend one - third of the taxpayers ' dollars on things that have nothing to do at all with delivering government programs to needy people in this country ?
finally , they ask that public safety be given a higher priority than the rights of the violent offender for early release .
Mr. Richard Marceau :
quite simply , companies will hire only if it is in the interest of their profitability to do so .
that is in absolute terms , real bottom line dollars .
we were concerned about provisions in Bill C - 72 for the board to buy grain for cash from anyone , anywhere at any time .
it is where my wife and I met 29 years ago , where we raised our family , where we work and where we pay our taxes .
Mr. Speaker , it is helpful for the member to ask the question and then tell me what I should answer .
Mr. Chuck Cadman ( Surrey North , Ref. ) :
we cannot rely only on pockets of success in the face of tidal waves of international competition .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
while we will constantly strive to reform the Senate , we recognize that the reality of today is that Canadians have a Senate that is unelected , unequally distributed by any measure and whose effectiveness and legitimacy are questionable .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast for the question .
Mr. Speaker , today marks the beginning of a month of mourning for over 5,000 women who died of breast cancer in 1997 .
the rest was downloaded on to the backs of the provinces .
a hallmark of the government has been our capacity to understand and ensure ourselves of the priorities of Canadians and to show that we can respond to those in a fiscally responsible way .
MPs pay only 9.5 percent of their income and yet they can collect millions .
will the Prime Minister not acknowledge that the Speech from the Throne sanctions his vision of Canada , where all major decisions will be made in Ottawa , with the provinces being relegated to the position of subsidiaries of Ottawa , and where Quebecers as a people have no place ?
does the Minister of Finance admit that the problems the government has identified in these areas are basically due to the cuts of over $ 40 billion it made during its first mandate and intends to keep on making during this mandate ?
municipal GOVERNMENTS
Mr. Speaker , yes there is a beautiful golf course in the national park at Cape Breton which is enjoyed by the thousands of visitors who come there in the summer .
the Deputy Speaker :
will the prime minister make a firm commitment today to hold full public hearings across the country prior to any such investment deal being signed ?
i would suggest that many of us recognize that .
i wish you well and I look forward to it .
it is time to start reducing the debt .
that is what we must strive for .
this government could make a real commitment to the east coast fishers in towns like Ingonish and Pleasant Bay .
the death benefit will continue to be equal to six months of retirement benefits , but up to a maximum of $ 2,500 rather than the current $ 3,580 .
that is three times what the government plan offers .
it is an enormously successful plan which members from every stakeholder group in the economy , from labour unions to business to small business to taxpayers , have embraced .
Mr. Speaker , my question is also for the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
Mr. Murray Calder
is this the face we want to put on politics ?
third we will match the growth in cost to the ability to pay by tightening up on the administration of benefits and changing the way some benefits are calculated .
of course , should canola producers wish to join the Canadian Wheat Board , three very specific rules will apply .
members will know that we are in an economy right now where things are very much on the rebound , people are being hired and plants are being expanded .
i hope members will support this bill and force their supporters to actually support them .
however , the New Zealand government first began to pay down its debt before giving tax relief .
the government ' s changes to employment insurance saw many of the families in these communities forced to go on welfare as they did not meet the required hours to qualify for EI benefits .
criminal CODE
this is a very positive statement about how we want to invest .
they are defending that owner too diligently .
oh , oh .
government ORDERS
the board will have control .
that is responsibility .
if we walk up and down Commercial Drive or through bustling historic Chinatown or along the neighbourhood streets of Strathcona , one of Vancouver ' s oldest communities , the sense of unique neighbourhoods and their history and character is very evident .
bill C - 233 .
some hon. members :
does the Solicitor General still have any credibility ?
or , do we try to manage the trade so that we will forgo the kinds of expenses and the kinds of energies obviously implicit in any fight on any mechanism ? "
oh , oh .
this year when foreign fishing threatened Pacific salmon stocks this government responded by taking the British Columbia government to court .
* * *
we have already begun to reduce the debt as a proportion of the size of the economy .
the international day of older persons reminds us that every Canadian , regardless of age , has a right to participate fully in community life .
obviously I do not have the statistics that the member has before him .
the former justice minister is here parroting the false story and cover up detailed by Mr. Amerasinghe in a secret memo to John Sims .
what are the priorities that Canadians are asking us to address ?
the member says there has to be equality among the provinces .
social justice involves a system in which those who toil , being part of the community , own the productive machinery of the nation and therefore receive every day and every month their full and just share of the wealth that they produce .
my grandfather on my father ' s side homesteaded in Saskatchewan at the turn of the century .
i would like to congratulate my hon. opponent from across the way .
i am extremely pleased to see the Prime Minister of Canada and the premiers have specifically addressed the situation of our young people -
those who do not have the funds , those poor Canadians , are the ones who will end up without pensions .
what steps is the federal government taking to ensure Canadians will continue to have easy access to the United States ?
Mr. Gary Lunn
Mr. Larry McCormick :
Mr. Speaker , it is a privilege to participate in the debate on Bill C - 2 , an act to establish the Canada pension plan investment board and to amend the Canada pension plan , the Old Age Security Act and other related acts .
the Canadian Wheat Board has shown itself to be a model , an institution second to none in marketing intelligence and ability through its operating structure to maximize returns back to primary producers .
as we all know , when you invest in an RRSP , as all Canadians are able to do if they choose to and have the funds to do so , there is a commensurate tax reduction to reflect that investment .
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) :
i assure the House that we are going to keep the pressure on .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
this is a huge undertaking , but at what price ?
these people think it belongs to them .
yet the Prime Minister and the President of the Treasury Board refuse to budge , hiding behind lame excuses .
the Canadian Wheat Board is one of those tools of co - operation .
( official Version )
certain Quebeckers are worried about this constitutional amendment .
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to present seven petitions today on the same topic .
what about cutting income taxes and doing it now so that people can see the light at the end of the tunnel and not just another big government spending program ?
by the time we get to the peak we will only have three workers taking care of one pensioner .
but after this initial period new Canada pension plan funds offered to provinces at market rates will be in line with the proportion of provincial bonds held by pension funds in general .
i will give a definition .
they say it is something that is grassroots and democratic .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
as much as we would like to dwell on the history of political fundraising abuses , I am more interested in getting to the root of the problem and trying to fix the problems associated with the current system .
we all heard about the two employees who spoke up against the unacceptable situation in nursing homes caused by the cuts in transfer payments to the provinces .
i commend it to the hon. member in response to his question .
Mr. Speaker , I will use an analogy also .
no provincial minister was allowed to take part .
they announced it about a month ago and our department was very much involved in pulling it together .
we will succeed in the empowerment of the wheat board .
will the Prime Minister show leadership now and apologize to Atlantic Canadians for betraying that trust ?
nothing better illustrates the ongoing commitment to this tradition than Canada ' s leadership since 1994 in the international effort to ban anti - personnel mines .
as Mr. Thompson is a former Ontario Liberal leader , it is doubtful our prime minister would toss him out despite Senator Thompson ' s being the most rotten apple in an ancient -
Mr. Preston Manning
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
moreover , in the case of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , the person involved admitted he had made a mistake and the code of conduct was immediately applied because that person was an employee accountable to the minister and to the government .
what is really interesting is that she basically confirmed everything the Reform Party has been saying for so many years , that every part of this great country of ours is unique and distinct and has its own unique and distinct character .
i want to give the House an example .
all this with contributions soaring .
the government should stop treating francophones as second class citizens , and set up two autonomous corporations with equivalent budgets based on the same cost per hour of programming .
did he talk about Quebeckers ' concerns ?
i would like an update on when the government is going to make an announcement about helicopters for the Canadian people .
it will really hurt the four Atlantic provinces because their borrowing rates are more expensive .
beyond the international commitments Canadians are well aware of and justifiably proud of , our forces first and foremost carry out a full slate of missions at home .
i would like to thank my constituents in Saint - Michel , Villeray and Parc Extension for their vote of confidence , and I can tell them today in the House that I will make sure I represent them well and with the respect they deserve .
Mr. Speaker , I have a question for the Minister of Finance who , I guess like everyone else , was surprised yesterday to learn that interest rates are now on the way up again .
it is hypocritical for the member to say on the one hand that he wants to have a great debate and yet to raise such provocative issues like this when he knows that this party is a federalist party .
the people of St. Paul ' s are big picture people .
while the principle might be similar , the realities vary .
why ?
when a judge approaches legislation for interpretation he is not required in any way to follow the preamble .
people are sending us here to address issues that are common to them .
they are going to say " but the government has an involvement in this financially '' .

like J . S . Woodsworth and Stanley Knowles , I believe that the day will come when nations will be judged not by their military and economic strength , nor by the splendour of their capital cities and public buildings , but by the well - being of their people , by their level of health , nutrition and education , by their opportunities to earn a fair reward for their labour and by the protection that is afforded to the growing minds and bodies of their children .

i want to present the government with another flood warning .
i have great respect for most of their positions .

member FOR SAINT JOHN
we worked with the provinces and basically we began to look at three different scenarios .
there are those who insist that the government should have no participation on the board of directors .
i cannot overemphasize the importance of this .

so he took action in his own department .
let me give a couple of numbers .
fine , but the history of Quebec ' s plans for sovereignty goes back much further .
it is an affirmation of Canadian values .
we will not break our commitment to raise those issues day in and day out .
this is not the position of the Reform Party but we are aware that that position exists among some producers .
i am also delighted because we have a government that believes that each Canadian child existing now and hereafter is guaranteed a future beyond the year 2000 .
however it was disheartening to hear his outright refusal to consider their proposals .
i too have become a humiliated Quebecker and I too have rent a number of items of clothing after seeing the Quebec premier grovelling before the French government in an effort to get a yes he never got .

a financial institution lending money to a political party for a campaign and being paid back later certainly is not comparable to a bank making a $ 500,000 donation to a political party .
madam Speaker , since debate has drifted slightly off on to the extraordinary expense account of my colleague from Abitibi , I find it ironic to hear that his riding is large .
that would allow more regional representation in this House than it has ever enjoyed .

the agenda is very clear in my mind .
we face a crisis , a crisis that has been building in Cape Breton for at least 40 -

hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew ( Secretary of State ( Children and Youth ) , Lib . ) :
denying this fact amounts to refusing to fight against it .
we can wait and do what the auditor general said would be necessary in the next century and increase the payments my children and grandchildren will have to pay to 15 percent or we can act now and ensure that we have a fund that will meet that growing bulge in the retirement population .

i know that in the Conservative platform on which he ran in the last election two promises were made on agriculture that disturbed me a lot .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
if this is indeed the case , why is she so proud of the work of team Canada ?
those members often use , as did this member , notions of democracy .
clearly they have sent us here to administer that plan and to deliver it .
we have a lurking disaster , a staggering debt of over $ 500 billion , almost as much as the entire federal debt again , arising from the mistakes in the design and management of the CPP must be borne by all Canadians .
we think there is a strong enough consensus to allow this to proceed .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
there is no question that in that design of CPP legislation there needed to be -
i submit that we have made the right choice .
your petitioners request Parliament to affirm the duty of parents to responsibly raise their children according to their conscience and beliefs and retain section 43 in Canada ' s Criminal Code as it is currently worded .

in the downtown east side , in one of the communities in Vancouver East , more than 6,000 people live in what is called single occupant rooms , meaning that they are living in very substandard accommodation .
this will condemn thousands of families to continuing poverty and hardship .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for Calgary Northeast for seconding my bill .

some hon. members :
does the parliamentary secretary deny we have learned that Mr. Coffey has alleged that Marvin Goodman , a senior customs manager , authorized the use of a government office at 1 Front Street in Toronto for his sister to run a dress shop rent free .
Mr. Paul Bonwick
is that what he wants us to eliminate ?
stability in the wheat board process is very important and it is something that creates stability within the agricultural community .
hon. Jean J . Charest
which ministers were travelling with which fund raisers ?

when I was elected I asked my eight year old son what I should say and do .
the House will now proceed to the taking of the deferred recorded division on the referral to committee before second reading of Bill C - 4 .
it is very important that we as a government take the initiative to give our people the skills .
during Liberal presentations we were told about the investment board that would look after the huge Canada pension plan premium fund .
madam Speaker , pursuant to the standing orders I put forth a motion dealing with an epidemic in our midst , the crisis of organ donations in the country .
Mr. Speaker , the member has her facts absolutely wrong .
the hon. member for Wild Rose and one other member of another First Nation protested the position being taken by DIAND officials .
where are those prairie MPs who said they would listen to the farmers ?
the day may come - I hope it will , and it will if Quebec ever has a government willing to work for those Quebeckers who wish to remain a part of Canada and they are the majority - when there is a legal and constitutional text to consider as such .
the real policy of the government in this area is nothing but a sham .
madam Speaker , after sitting through Clifford Olson ' s section 745 hearing for four days , there are really no words to describe it .
i would like to thank my parents also for teaching me the values I now bring to political life .
i hope there is still a long way to go .
Canadian sales abroad come to more than a quarter of a trillion dollars .
canada is doing more now to track Nazi war criminals than almost any country in the world .
i call on the government and all members of the House to heed our concerns .
in my riding of Erie - Lincoln it was announced that all four hospitals would be either closed or their services downgraded substantially .
the social democratic position would be to challenge the whole assumption that there are only three pork chops .
most Canadian pension plans did .
Quebeckers clearly feel that , while denominational school boards adequately reflected the reality of Quebec before the quiet revolution , today linguistic school boards would correspond more closely with the values and sociological realities of the province .
the Speaker :
in conclusion , today has been a dark day for our country .
in the Speech from the Throne , there is also a reference to videos .
we will continue our strong support for youth seeking to make the transition from school to work by extending existing international science and technology and first nations internships , by extending student summer job programs , by sharpening their focus on relevant experience , by building on existing exchange programs and by creating a new national career mentorship program in partnership with provinces and the private sector .

while I am on my feet I wish to inform the House that it is the intention of the government to refer Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act that was presented to this Parliament earlier today to committee before second reading pursuant to Standing Order 73 ( 1 ) .
last year , the auditor general sharply criticized the federal government for the uncalled for - and I would say exorbitant - increase in the cost of disability benefits , an increase caused mainly by regulations that are too lax and a follow - up , let us face it , that is non - existent .
they want obligations of the CPP to be clearly defined .
the people of Tadoule still seek compensation for forced relocation that almost saw the total destruction of an entire people .
some things just do not change .
at the opposite end of the scale we have Ontario , with 448,065 per senator , and Alberta with 449,471 .
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to be able take part in this tribute to the memory of the late Hon. Stanley Knowles .
i must also thank my wife and my children for their support and for allowing me to be here to represent the Bloc Quebecois of course , but more importantly to look out for the interests of the Quebec people .
indeed contribution rates will rise in steps over the next six years from the current rate of 5.85 % to 9.9 % of contributory earnings and then remain steady , instead of rising to 14.2 % by the year 2030 as projected by the chief actuary .
does this mean that its financing will be maintained , cut , or that it will again benefit from the government ' s largesse ?
in addition to the changes that I have mentioned , all of the amendments made to Bill C - 72 in the last Parliament have been retained in Bill C - 4 .
Mr. Speaker , there was an inquiry by the RCMP and there were some problems that arose during that inquiry .
i will be sharing my time with the member for Waterloo - Wellington who will speak after me .
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the comments of the critic of the Conservative Party and thank him for his intervention .
by continuing to represent only the interests of the separatists , Lucien Bouchard is showing that he does not care about all Quebecers .
these are only two of many areas where Canadians are proud that there is not the want and the disadvantage and the need as in other countries of the world that are not as fortunate as we have been .
in partnership with the provinces we will invest $ 150 million over the next three years .
Mr. Speaker , the government clearly does not understand the depth of the problem .
it now houses a greater percentage of non - protective custody offenders who are defiant , aggressive and organized .
Mr. Speaker , it is always a pleasure to see you again .

Mr. Speaker , I looked at the statement made by the official spokesman of the Government of France .
it will be shared among those who will benefit both in the short term and in the long term .
what must be understood is that the problems very often differ from one region to the next .
does the Prime Minister realize that the fact that the premiers have chosen such inadequate tools for a consultation of this nature says a lot about how little importance they attach to their own Calgary declaration ?
the Canadian Wheat Board is a $ 6 billion enterprise doing business in 70 countries worldwide .

how does the Minister of the Environment intend to put a stop to this unacceptable negligence by her government , which , we must remember , puts people ' s health and safety at risk ?
Mr. Speaker , I would think that government members would have enough interest in the Canada pension plan and the future of our security that they would at least be in the House to participate in this debate .
it is there for all Canadians .
in my area of Erie - Lincoln there are many French Canadian people who have family in Quebec .
on top of that , it helps the tourist industry in an area which needs some help .
we will develop with the provinces a mentorship program , and we will partner with the provinces and communities to give the young at risk a better chance at acquiring the skills and experience they need .
we have had quite a bit of information on this matter .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on the same question of privilege to provide some clarity .
* * *
i believe it has done this very well .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
the CRTC , as an independent body with a transparent process , separate from the political process , is a model which we could only wish all of our trading partners had fully implemented .
British Columbians desire many of the same changes in Confederation that Quebeckers do .
i am confident that our new minister of agriculture from Ontario will serve Canadian agriculture with the same level of distinction as did his predecessor .
the government as I said takes the matter very seriously .
the demand should determine what grain goes where .
i am happy to talk about our priorities for students , for young Canadians whose parents are among the working poor and who need a break .
a very clear direction should be given from the Parliament of Canada that we want the fund invested in useful ways as opposed to a fund that will perhaps buy bank stocks which will have marginal impact on assisting the Canadian economy generally .
political CONTRIBUTIONS
yea .
we have also said that we will bring down the EI premiums as soon as and as fast as it makes sense , and we are doing that as well .
it is only through that approach that we will have a reasonable chance of getting some of these ideas into a debate with some credibility attached .
not only that , but for larger contracts we created a committee on which members of the advertising industry and government officials sit to choose the most competent bidder .
organizations such as Les Femmes Chefs d ' Entreprises Mondiales are vehicles through which private citizens can act as goodwill ambassadors and introduce Canadian products and services to other countries .

it is the growing influence of the new west , that portion of our country that stretches from western Ontario across the vast prairies and woodlands of Manitoba and Saskatchewan , into the plains and foothills of Alberta , across the mighty Rockies to the Pacific coast of the great province of British Columbia .
apart from the family income side of the equation there is more that the government can and will do .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur
oh , oh .
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the member ' s speech and agreed with a great deal of it except for the first bumpy part at the beginning when he was doing the hail the government ' s throne speech business about modernizing the health care system and all that sort of stuff .
they should get that money back .
our success depends on harnessing the energies of all Canadians , of all governments , federal , provincial and territorial , of the voluntary sector and of the private sector .
we had Meech , we had Charlottetown , now we have Calgary and tomorrow we may have Canada ' s Wonderland .
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) :
i guess they do not understand pension contributions but that is what they are .
but that would have been the lesser evil , considering that our entire democratic system would have benefited in future from funding from party members and supporters .
the government is still refusing to honour the $ 2 billion pay equity debt owing to 80,000 women in this country .
i will respond by saying that we did not tell the CRTC it must issue licences to any and all companies wishing one .
it is a policy that the former Conservative government talked about quite a bit but never did anything about it .
bill C - 2 .
i submit that a balanced approach is the best approach .
as far as public finances are concerned , we must refer to page 4 of the throne speech , which reads , and I quote , " This 36 th Parliament opens at a time when we have brought order to our public finances '' .

introduction and first reading
i was also very pleased to find out that the hon. member believes that now is the time to engage in serious debate about which direction we are going to take .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
i believe Canadians all across this country are very concerned and have some very grave reservations not only about the health of our country in terms of our national unity but also about the health and well - being of the many important matters that fall under this minister ' s purview .
thousands of civilians military workers have been affected by the government ' s policies to shove anything that moves into the private sector .
never did they speak that it would be better for the producers .
that is why the Reform Party today has spent a good deal of its time questioning the government about its priorities and about its sincerity in dealing with the issues that the new justice minister said in August were going to be the priorities of this government .
it is my belief that an economically prosperous community is able to better overcome other social problems .
after these public consultations , the premiers are then expected to introduce resolutions in their respective legislatures .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to acknowledge the full sponsorship of Horizons North of the NWT High Performance Hockey Program .
it was painfully clear that the previous government was not prepared to listen to the views of ordinary Canadians .
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) :
i requested this meeting to obtain information which is directly related to the preparation of a question which I need to ask the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development on behalf of the citizens of the Stony reserve .
the Speaker :
it is for those people who are not that we ought to have concerns .
participating municipalities were judged on the quality of their green spaces , the diversity and originality of their landscaping , general tidiness , environmental awareness , heritage conservation as well as the level of community involvement .
our program for growth has three main thrusts : sound management of taxpayers ' money ; quality of life for our fellow citizens and , finally , initiatives for a brighter future .
Mr. Speaker , last week Conservative Senator Pat Carney stated that the sovereignty of British Columbia ought to be examined as a valid alternative .
for example Canada ' s old age security and medicare benefits are regulated and funded by the national government and rightly so .
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron
Mr. Preston Manning ( Calgary Southwest , Ref. ) :
health
Mr. Speaker , first of all , I wish to welcome the Conservative Party leader , who is now back in the front row .
we must continue to cut the red tape for small businesses and entrepreneurs .
there are different approaches to the question of national unity and how the government should respond to the problem .
in fact , I thought it was not just immoral or unethical , I thought it was illegal for someone who is the Prime Minister of the country .
we have not gone through four years of very difficult times to forget that everything we do must be affordable and reflective of the fiscal reality .
the question I would have asked him pertains to his continued attacks on the MP pension plan .
while I agree with that plan , I also believe it is very much incumbent on business , large and small , to partner with us in the creation of these jobs by providing internships , providing youth with the skills and mentoring that gives them the experience and life skills to help them obtain gainful employment .
but he must tell the House the truth .
* * *
this special week reminds us all of the dangers of fire and promotes messages of safety and prevention .
except that the redistribution of powers , the federal power to spend , and the new mechanisms for co - operation affect not only Quebecers and westerners but also people in the Atlantic provinces and in Ontario .
considering it is very clear that all the contracts had to be tendered and also it is clear that all decisions had to be agreed to by the federal government , did the federal government agree to issue $ 113 million of contracts untendered , or did the province circumvent the terms of the agreement and do it by itself ?
the hon. member for West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , one question .
for me and for many Quebeckers of all generations that solution is sovereignty accompanied by an offer of partnership which will be made and will continue to be made in good faith by Quebeckers like myself .
with the premiers making the effort to make the change , now is the time for us to come together and build for the future .
the cost - cutting measures taken by this government were felt more deeply by women than by any other group in our society .
that is surprising .
i want to draw from it right now to explain how the Reform Party would approach the ad hoc debate that is occurring today in the country about what to do with any surplus .
standing ORDERS
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member mentioned in his remarks the need to resolve the national unity problem .
he is referring to the government side .
it does not provide a child rearing drop out provision and it will not provide indexation .
each year in Canada fire claims hundreds of lives and incurs hundreds of millions of dollars in damage .
his wording was something like there was a time when people had to trust their representatives or their officials .
there will be a debate but we want to refer it to a committee so that it will be studied .
the assets will be managed in a professional manner , independent of governments , by an investment board , which will periodically report to the public and to the various governments on its activities .
jobs have subsequently been created in Ontario , but I suggest that almost all jobs creation was created by lower interest rates which are directly related to the government ' s commitment to reducing its deficit .
we also advocated the increase in the GST tax credit for adults and children by 30 percent .
some hon. members :
people ' S TAX FORM ACT
Thursday , October 2 , 1997
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
should we be alarmed by the fact that the speech does not mention the CBC ?
let us not forget that during the last three and a half years of Parliament this Liberal government , this very Liberal government that is going around looking for pats on the back for its balanced budget prediction , increased taxes in this country in 36 different areas .

claimants dissatisfied with the board ' s decision may then ask for a reconsideration within 90 days but this would entail more waiting and would likely be to no avail .

hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
canada has winning sectors , sectors on which we can build and grow to world leadership , for example , aerospace , environmental technologies , biotechnology and telecommunications and information technologies .
given its constitutional history , what makes the Prime Minister think that Quebecers can trust the Liberal government ?
the government is talking about democracy .
our federation makes the most of these talents .
however , because of the regulations governing RRSPs , they are unable to get the best return on the market for their money .
that is absolute nonsense .
after 1965 , and even more so after 1968 , when Pierre Elliott Trudeau became Prime Minister of Canada , Quebec could no longer get its powers back .
some hon. members :
i would point out that , in 1980 , a referendum was held in Quebec on that question and , as far as I know , the Government of Quebec honoured the choice of the majority of Quebeckers .

we believe that Canada is at a crossroad .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
oh , oh .
one of the reasons why we are successful is because it does not matter which part of the world we are going to trade with , we are going to have Canadians coming from those backgrounds who can open doors that would not be possible otherwise .

Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :

we went through the evolution of supply management and the transformation from hand milking to mechanical milking , from stanchion barns to loafing barns with milking parlours , all the time subject to the cost - price squeeze that has become characteristic of trying to operate a family farm .
if the media and the official opposition did not push for answers I doubt the government would have told us about this situation at all .
as I worked on the text of this response to the throne speech , I spent a great deal of time and energy struggling with the semantics of the complex concept of sustainable development .
they are shoving the unemployed onto welfare because of the cuts , but paying $ 12 million for a national forum which leaves no room for the provinces .

i think she had better say whether or not she is prepared to go as far as recommended by the royal commission on Indian affairs .
it is not like the OAS or the GIS which are available based on your level of income .
i think we might resume debate .
Mr. Speaker , later today I will have the honour to attend the Asia Connects Youth Conference being held in Winnipeg this week to mark Canada ' s Year of Asia - Pacific .
Mr. Jim Jones :
Mr. Gilles - A .
he can no longer call us the third party .
we have seniors concerned about their future socioeconomic well - being , despite their many years of solid contributions to our society .
the second principle is compassion for the underprivileged , a principle which is the underpinning of a social safety net which Canadians of all parties speak of with pride .
the greatest legacy we can leave to our children in the new millennium is a vibrant living legacy that will make Canada a better place : a stronger country with a brighter future and greater opportunities for its young people .
we are continuing our efforts to establish an international criminal court which as a court of universal and general jurisdiction would replace limited geographical sectoral bodies like the recent ad hoc jurisdictions as the former Yugoslavia and also Rwanda .
the committee will go right across the country and will consult with Canadians from every sector and every walk of life on their budget priorities .
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
hon. Andy Scott
is it fair ?
i hope that this institution will respect Quebeckers ' upcoming decision .
name the countries that have it .
because the future means 44 Bloc members .
we have already invested heavily in research support and infrastructure renewal , and we intend to continue our role of supporting and jump starting the Montreal economy in the years to come .
that is the way the system works .
the House met at 11 a.m.
my advice to the member is that if he thinks that argument has any sway at all , keep on using it while he still can because the days are counted .
Mr. Gary Lunn
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea .
call in the members .
already we see a margin of error of 80 percent in the forecast of the contribution rate .
it is not the way to build a strong country .
this will show leadership to employers in the private sector and facilitate the development and professionalism of Canada ' s citizen soldiers .
similarly , this administration and its leaders with a wealth of knowledge and expertise has done many things .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
why was the minister ' s own policy at Correctional Service Canada not followed in the Machell case ?
all those opposed will please say nay .
i am quite happy to leave the payroll taxes to the neo - Cons on the opposite side of the House .
if he can check the blues , I believe he will appreciate my clarification on the people in our society who are being left behind .
but all of that is history .
Mr. Speaker , family reunification for all immigrants who have already come to Canada is a departmental priority and it goes without saying that all these cases will receive priority treatment from the Department of Citizenship and Immigration .
am I to understand that we will fight together for the same cause ?
who am I to trust ?
people must not be allowed to do that in government .
that is how big the surplus has to be and these goons are talking about -
the finances are coming together but I think we have a little further to go .
this seems to be a very honourable motive .
hon. Don Boudria ( Glengarry - Prescott - Russell , Lib . ) :
hon. Andy Scott
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Pierrefonds - Dollard , Lib . ) :
it is unacceptable that the former justice minister refused to remove Ted Thompson for his professional and unethical misconduct despite Reform urging him to do so .
it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings at this time and put forthwith the question on the motion now before the House .
house OF COMMONS
that is right .
what is the record they are applauding ?
when the Tory government raised CPP premiums six times from 3.6 percent to 5 percent over the period 1987 to 1993 , the Liberals then in opposition labelled these increases as tax hikes .
there are not enough fish in the water to sustain a viable fishing industry .
i must point out right now that , on the whole , the Bloc Quebecois agrees with the general principles of this reform .
is that not the goal of the NDP ?
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) :
question PERIOD
we often hear in the House that the measure of a country is how it treats its most vulnerable citizens .
we do not pay more than other OECD countries for our public pension plans .
it is truly an honour to be sent by the people to this House to represent their concerns and aspirations .
i could go on and on with this , folks , but I can assure the House that Atlantic Canadians will not stand for it any longer .
the Reform bill does much more .
the language councils are to be consulted prior to the establishment of the schools needed for the students of the linguistic minority .
with the recent downsizing of the regular force the demand on reservists will undoubtedly increase .
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) :
it reminds me of the old saying that when you throw a rock in the dark and a dog barks , you hit a dog .
these folks have borrowed one hundred thousand million dollars in the last four years .
will the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health commit to explore such ways to eradicate child hunger by the new millennium ?
we are not going to be fooled by the finance minister ' s crocodile tears .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
since then however the slowdown in wages and workforce growth and higher real interest rates have completely changed the circumstances in which the CPP must be financed .
when will it stop ?
Mr. Peter MacKay :
first , does he not find it strange to be about the only cabinet member who did not know ?
all of us on this side of the House wish you well .
in December 1997 we will ride that current together .
we will build on the mutual respect Canadians have for one another to achieve our common aspirations for a better future .
i wonder if you are ruing the day you got the appointment to be in the chair .
the Reform Party is proposing to have a constituent assembly comprised of the entire province of Quebec .
what I am hearing across the floor is funny .
there are going to be surpluses .
in the past three months we saw gains of 52,000 jobs for young Canadians , but it is not enough .
the chief actuary has shown that if we do not move fast the CPP will be bankrupt in 2015 and the rates will have to soar to 14.2 percent by 2030 .
hon. Jean J . Charest
the Speaker :
madam Speaker , although there was not a question there , I thought I made it pretty clear without really spelling it out that the surplus was there as a result of the Government of Canada not paying its dues to its employees and not paying its dues to the people who were unemployed .
but something bothers me a little .
we in the NDP find it ironic that while we debate sovereignty in the House , whether it be Quebec sovereignty or Canadian sovereignty , the government may be negotiating away our sovereignty in Paris , as we speak , in the multilateral agreement on investment .
to have the taxpayers believe that their future , comfort and security depends on it , the federal government will try to start investing again in health , education and social assistance , all of which are areas under provincial jurisdiction .
fortunately the next day the Prime Minister spoke on the Speech from the Throne , and I found his remarks full of eloquence and ideas .
maybe I am too partisan .
but first , since this is my maiden speech in this new Parliament , I want to take 30 seconds to thank the constituents of T 茅 miscamingue for renewing their trust in me and tell them I will do my best to represent them adequately during this Parliament .
the hon. member raised a lot of different issues .
provinces and territories are understanding there is a role for them to play as we try to make life better for aboriginal Canadians .
i want to congratulate you on your elevation to the Chair .
bill C - 2 .
that is why we went on to sign NAFTA , and a free trade agreement with Chile , and a free trade agreement with Israel .
i can assure you that both my party and I will support you fully in this task and the other important functions of your office .
if there are any further accidents , injuries or losses due to the prime minister ' s callous partisanship in delaying this purchase , Canada will hold him personally accountable .
they must have made CPP contributions in four of the last six years prior to becoming disabled .
let us continue to follow the wisdom of the pioneers who built our post - secondary institutions .
why ?
whenever the member appears to get to the end of his questioning he lapses into the thing I tried to have him avoid .
the Speaker
it seems that the question period is progressing very well thanks to you because you want it , not because I want it .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
the Deputy Speaker :
the 1993 election report that was published states that the riding of Abitibi received 29 donations , for a total of $ 9,400 .
Mr. Speaker , I have just a brief comment .
for example parents in Alberta , Saskatchewan and Manitoba with a keen interest in ensuring a religious based education for their children are watching both with interest and apprehension the precedents being set in educational reform and changes to minority rights in both Newfoundland and Quebec .
let us review some of the changes to the benefits and their administration I indicated earlier .
or the government can let itself go and drift away from democracy , this has already started , driven mostly by the anti - sovereignist phobia of the Prime Minister and his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs .
the last member said " Hey , this is an honourable place '' .
Mr. Greg Thompson
indeed , Canadians are greatly concerned about any changes to the plan which might have an adverse effect on their economic stability .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien
it was beautiful .
Mr. Speaker , the prime minister has done it to health care .
starting in February , we were forecasting that the deficit for the year ending March 31 , 1997 would not exceed $ 10 billion and that , by 1997 - 98 , the deficit would be zero .
* * *
madam Speaker , I believe the person who will be correcting that will be the third in line in this segment .
when we look at the per capita representation on a provincial basis , there is only one province which is near the national average , Quebec , with 297,450 people per senator .
the business community of Canada is lining up to be on the trip .
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen ( Windsor - St.
he said that we needed to work closely with the business community .
we enjoy going there .
did we do it the old fashioned way ?
( motion agreed to )
section 93 ( 1 ) as it currently stands does not prevent Quebec or any other province from reforming its educational system or from implementing reforms that affect minority rights , but conformity to the rule of law as provided by section 93 ( 1 ) does require that the Quebec government demonstrate that any proposed reforms do not prejudicially affect the rights of those who desire a religious orientation in the education of their children .
a zero deficit does not mean Canada ' s debt burden has been made any lighter .
Mr. Speaker , since this is questions and comments , I will refer to the remarks made by the member for Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford .
the Deputy Speaker :
* * *
the result of these consultations and subsequent federal - provincial discussions is the legislation that is before us today with respect to the Canada pension plan .
Mr. Speaker , in the light of the very serious allegations in the matter of influence peddling , how does the Prime Minister explain the government ' s ethics section not ordering an immediate internal inquiry in the offices of ministers who may be involved and the fact that it has taken over seven months , questions from the opposition and from journalists and a report by the CBC pointing the finger at an employee of the minister to discover that the minister still has not found out what was going on in his office ?
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
what about survivor benefits ?
Mr. Monte Solberg
it will establish Centres of Excellence to deepen our understanding of children ' s development and well - being and to improve our ability to respond to their needs .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , we just mentioned the devolution of powers from the RCMP to local police forces .
we said clearly and loudly during the election that when we achieve a surplus , 50 percent of that surplus will go to the kind of social spending that the NDP talks about and for tax relief , and 50 p . cent will go toward debt reduction .
in the last four years there has not been a fish plan , the only four years when there has not been a fish plan agreed to by Canada and the United States .
the value of community impact statements must be acknowledged , particularly in the case of alleged victimless crimes such as drugs and prostitution where the impact on the community is significant .
four years later , the people of Quebec and Canada as well as the auditor general are still waiting for this shameful waste to stop .
i promise I will not be rending my shirt in here .
i enjoyed working with the warm people and progressive municipalities of the town of Pelham and Welland South .
men and women want an economy that creates jobs , not sheds them .
also leading on into the agreement another clause states that all contracts shall be awarded to the qualified and responsible tenderer submitting the lowest evaluated bid .
madam Speaker , I too would like to congratulate you and the other Speakers who will occupy the chair and rule on our debates to ensure that we conduct ourselves with the level of decorum that Canadians expect of their parliamentarians .
they are a part of Canada .
what I have heard in response troubles me .
Mr. Nelson Riis
how about Nothing Fancy stores , $ 89,000 .
madam Speaker , I guess what I would like to know then is how are the Liberals planning on finding out those statistics ?
it culminated in a set of recommendations made by the Western Grain Marketing Panel in July 1996 .
regardless of what unanimity may exist in the National Assembly in Quebec , obviously a variety of concerns if not viewpoints have been expressed here this afternoon that point out the reason why we have due constitutional process in this place .
resource development is taking place .
i submit that the changes I have outlined propose moderate and balanced changes .
on division .
of course he completely ignored the fact that the Harris government in Ontario is introducing similar legislation .
they will not see a reduction in their benefits .
Canadians both delight in our magnificent environment and fear for its future .
we have achieved a most significant advance in joint federal , provincial and territorial social policy in the last 30 years .
i think , however , that he should not question our sincerity , as we are democratically elected members from Quebec .
all provincial governments agreed to the legislation and this government is committed , along with the provincial governments , to having the legislation passed by Christmas .
- industry , Votes 1 , 5 , L 10 , L 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , 40 , 45 , 50 , 55 , 60 , 65 , 70 , 75 , 80 , 85 , 90 , 95 , 100 , 105 , 110 , 115 and 120
that is what I call democracy .
the first one is from a group of residents of my riding of Cypress Hills - Grasslands who are petitioning Parliament to ensure that section 43 of Canada ' s criminal code is retained in its present form so that parents will still have their existing right to discipline their children in a reasonable manner as they see fit .
motions FOR PAPERS
he always paid attention to Parliament and cared about Parliament and cared about what Parliament was doing and how it was doing it .
Mr. Speaker , let me first inform the House that Bradson Security has negotiated a tentative agreement .
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) :
the next referendum will be the right one .
nay .
our domestic economy has been on its back for the last four years .
if we act to sever that artery by replacing or opposing a central role for government , we cease to be individuals and revert to the status of subject .
that is the least partners can do , celebrate with pomp and circumstance the occasion of an event as important as the arrival of a new country among the nations .
canada has learned the lesson over the last 10 years that doing business without agreements and without a level playing field can be a very turbulent thing indeed .
access TO INFORMATION ACT
quite the contrary .
the government will continue to fight this insulting legislation and it is my belief that it will soon win Canadians a well deserved exemption .
* * *
victims of crime are not alone in feeling their loss , society too experiences a loss - that of the potential of a young life .
government members will say that it is a government bill and they have to vote for it .
* * *
not some partisan petty little shot in order to score political points , but people who are out there to critique .
i do not recommend that the big government , high spending , high taxation Liberals uncover their ears just yet .
Mr. John Solomon :
no one in the House will be surprised to know that if nothing had been done by the government in Bill C - 2 , it is conceivable that in a few years the pension system , the program that helps our seniors , the disability benefits , the maternity leave which many , including my wife , take , would not be there .
the government could have offered a different course to the country .
there is no procedural significance in this case either , Mr. Speaker , and I ask that you consider my points accordingly .
we have consistently had from the New Democratic Party of British Columbia rejection of the contacts with Americans that I have made , with every senator from Alaska , Washington state and Oregon , with representatives of the White House , representatives of the state department and the governors of Oregon , Washington and Alaska .
i can say that it is very very good to see so many shining beaming faces .
Mr. Speaker , I hope the Prime Minister attaches a little more importance to this , which I am sure he does .
however , a vision and a plan are not enough .
instead , the citizen is reduced to the status of a subject at the foot of the throne of the marketplace .
could she assure us that she will take to Kyoto in two months time a specific detailed plan that lives up to Canada ' s promise to reduce emissions by 20 per cent from 1988 levels by the year 2005 ?
at present , the maximum is set at $ 3,580 for a person receiving survivor benefits .
how can he ignore the miraculous turnaround of an economy that had been called an economic basket case ?
food AND DRUGS ACT
they will receive the disability benefit until they reach age 65 , at which time they will commence collecting the normal pension payment .
by painting pictures of things that may not happen is not serving the interests of Canadians .
reformers also stress that programs must be soundly designed and managed .
they claim it is irrelevant , as was the Liberal government ' s Motion No. M - 26 in the last Parliament .
* * *
in Erskine May ' s 21 st edition , at page 115 , it states that an offence for contempt " may be treated as contempt even though there is no precedent for the offence '' .
the Prime Minister ' s use of the Senate as the first house to consider his government ' s legislation is insulting and offensive to the dignity of this elected House .
i will do my best to ensure their trust in me has been well placed .
it is my pleasure to continue to be of service to them .
it spent $ 19,400 for a study for policing the boundaries of male sexuality from 1880 to 1930 .

i feel that it is too bad that other members of his party when they had the chance to bring these reforms about 10 years ago did not see the light as he has .
some hon. members :
oral QUESTION PERIOD
if the government is going to have considerable financial exposure , then it is only reasonable that it have some window into the board ' s operations .
he ought to know it is incorrect to say the Reform is out to take away anyone ' s pension .
not only has this not been discussed , but the House of Commons finance committee strikes out next week to go on a tour across the country to hear from Canadians on completely different issues .
the issue of national unity continues to be of paramount importance to the residents of St. Paul ' s .

the Government of Canada solemnly affirms that the same requirement would be indispensable in the event that another province called for an amendment with respect to guarantees for minorities within its territory .
many of these are producers who are uncomfortable in having to deal with the complex and ever - changing market forces of the international grain trade .
accordingly , members who favour smaller and more responsible government must vote in favour of this motion .
decorum IN CHAMBER
either all producers join the Canadian Wheat Board or they ' re out .
the hon. member mixed up a company from Winnipeg with a company from Montreal .
they are basically satisfied with the government .
the board will be more flexible .
if this were to be permitted , a dangerous precedent could be set under which restrictions that had been placed on the powers of all provincial governments could be stripped back unilaterally from one province or another .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
every new Canadian that I spoke to understood that we are in a tight financial situation .
" changes are needed '' , he said , " if we want to ensure the Canada pension plan ' s ability to meet the income security needs of Canadians '' .
we felt that this was clearly hostile to the board and we could not understand why this provision was in the legislation .
farmers in Canada will not survive because of government action but because of their own ambition , innovation and initiative .
bill C - 4 .
rather we believe government in the 21 st century is an efficient , effective partner to make wise and strategic investments in areas that really count for the future prosperity of our country .
in my opinion the nays have it .

i have every confidence that the team assembled possesses the necessary skills and abilities to successfully oversee the affairs of this 36 th Parliament of Canada .
does the hon. member have an explanation for this ?
no other federation in the world permits such a situation although all federations allow provinces , states and cantons to establish their own constitutions so that citizens of each of these units can impose further restrictions on their own governments if they choose .
stewardship and accountability was a concern that has been responded to .
such a situation will not occur any more because last Friday we went out for new tenders .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
in the province of Quebec , politics serves the citizens , and Quebec is a model of democracy around the world .
there is one single mention in the throne speech .
throughout the preparation and debate on the legislation we have done everything possible to ensure that everybody with an interest in this complex issue has a had a full and fair opportunity to voice an opinion .
there is much work to do with all of us working together in our communities , our ridings , for the betterment of our country .
i declare the motion defeated .
what about the amendments to the Canada Labour Code ?
team Canada was playing against the sport ' s top ranked team .
they tabled a condescending report which was a total endorsement of federal interference in the health field .
i say to this House that the overwhelming majority of Quebeckers reject this narrow and dangerous vision , which dates back to the last century .
in the throne speech they mentioned the word partnership many times , over 10 times .
the first thing I would like to hear coming from the Minister of Finance is an ironclad commitment , a guarantee that the increased value of sheltered funds will never be taxed while they remain in RRSPs .
American author John Irving who with his Canadian wife has an apartment in St. Paul ' s , pointed out that it is the expectation of the Canadian social system to look after the people who cannot look after themselves .
we kept no balance of payments because we knew that Canada is more than a ledger of debits and credits .
there are other ways to continue putting our fiscal house in order .
the Bloc Quebecois has , moreover , never called for termination of the Canada pension plan , and I would refer you to my speeches in the House , which have always been along the same line : do not touch seniors rights .
Mr. Speaker , had I rewritten the question to please myself , I would not have written it differently .
is that agreed ?

the actuarial report in 1995 that the government used was based on some pretty low common denominator indicators .
the member who is now a member of the Reform Party changes his politics like a dirty shirt .
surely these people could not turn a blind eye to this .
by what mechanisms ?
the Deputy Speaker :
we would also like to see a review of the infrastructure system in Atlantic Canada to help it facilitate the worldwide market that we are finding more and more out there .
this will satisfy the needs of very religious people , but will there still be chaplains ?

the provisions in Bill C - 4 on this point are virtually identical to provisions that appear in the Canada Business Corporations Act which applies to all federally incorporated private sector companies in the country .
creating economic incentives and opening up markets while eliminating regulations , monopolies and protected markets helps to foster a new economy .
almost a third of our country consists of what we call baby boomers , of which they tell me I am on the leading edge .
there are a couple of things I would like to share with the House this afternoon .
the government ought to listen to the message that was sent by the voters .
Mr. Speaker , when you look at the way the federal government normally does its business , yes that is a fear in terms of patronage allotment of funding .
Robert Carlson of the National Farmer ' s Union said :
we want to ensure that does not happen again .
members
it raises the spectre of the return to surging deficits , a staggering debt and renewed taxation .
we should set the mechanisms up in advance .
that does not mean we will not have national standards or that people do not want them , but we need a new mechanism for the federal government to facilitate national standards for interprovincial agreement .
this morning let me touch briefly on three ways in which I believe the federal government can contribute positively and constructively toward restoring the confidence of Canadians in the quality of and access to health care .
naturally , we all have our own personality .
in this Parliament control of EI is an important lever that has an impact on the decisions young people make in the area of education and training .
Mr. Speaker , I sincerely hope the hon. member realizes it would be absolutely inappropriate to suggest that anybody would tell the RCMP to hold off on an investigation .
it is a great pleasure to speak to this House in reply to the throne speech , which outlines the government ' s priorities for the first session of the 36 th Parliament .

canada has roughly a 20 % share of the world market in grain .
i would also like to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on being re - elected to the Chair .
at the very least any provincial government demanding an amendment of this sort should be expected to refer the proposed amendment to the province ' s supreme court for a ruling as to whether the use of the section 43 amending formula is legally acceptable .
Mr. Ted White
we must not be seen as a haven for Nazi war criminals and others who have committed war crimes .
i did so in this one .
i think he should take another look at his history , including that of Quebec , because just because there were Liberal members from Quebec who were in agreement or who voted in favour of patriating the Constitution does not mean Quebeckers were in agreement .
in the last Parliament the NDP caucus opposed Bill C - 72 which is now Bill C - 4 which is before the House .

it is important to note however that if trade has been successful for Canada - and it has - we can attract investment and promote more trade as long as we are dealing in a transparent , rules based system of law .

i am not a financial expert in the slightest .
Mr. Gilles Bernier
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel :
i would also like to congratulate the leaders of the other parties who were re - elected in their ridings and who will have the opportunity to cross swords with all the members in this Parliament .
there is another reason for creating this joint committee , as the minister has pointed out in the past few weeks .
although my predecessors have set a very high standard , I will do my utmost to give voice to the concerns of my constituents in the House and its committees and I will work to ensure that their problems and inquiries with government programs and services are addressed with care and efficiency .
we have a high degree of unemployment in one of the most developed countries in the world .
you will understand that , in Quebec , we say no , no , no and no , as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs would say , to the Calgary declaration .
i would like to hear what he thinks about this and about the possibility of the New Democratic Party spearheading this original idea , that could be of much - needed benefit to Canada .
they knew that money spent on prevention was not money thrown away .
we also have to make changes to RRSPs so that they can plan for themselves and make decisions for themselves and for their future .
we still see the Liberal arrogance creeping into that member ' s comments .
will the solicitor general confirm that he indeed stated that he was aware that some of his colleagues knew ?
i would like to see him answer to my parents or any new immigrants coming to this country who will have to pay $ 8,000 for a family of eight to immigrate so they could receive the opportunities he has so eloquently described .
there can be no greater millennium project for Canada and no better role for government than to help young Canadians prepare for the knowledge based society of the next century .
it is precisely what I am asking you to consider here today , that this is an occasion where very early in this Parliament there is no reason to believe that the debate would have gone on and on .
it is a universal program .
i believe in investment , in investing in the development of original Canadian artistic product .

i also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the hundreds of thousands of volunteers across this country who worked in this campaign , whether they made donations , knocked on doors , printed flyers or put up signs .

does the hon. member think it is the responsibility of members of Parliament on both sides to seek public input on this prebudget consultation period and to hear from him where his constituents would like to see our government go .
in order to understand the similarities , we must start with a brief review of the history of ADM .
Mr. Deepak Obhrai
this is a part of the bill that might not seem to be that important to the ordinary person on the street but it will really affect Newfoundland and the other Atlantic provinces and to a lesser degree places like Saskatchewan and Manitoba which from time to time do not have the same bond rating as an Alberta or British Columbia .
had the government not introduced this legislation as it did on September 25 , action would have been deferred unduly and we would have found ourselves in a situation where the financial security of those coming after us might have been jeopardized .

when Quebec decides in a democratic way to declare its independence , it will be on the basis not of Canada ' s legislation but of international law as the Constitution makes no provision for such a scenario .

i am sorry but I did not see the hon. member for Abitibi second the motion when I read it .

privilege
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the member ' s comments and I certainly appreciate the way he laid out the issues .
this government ' s primary focus since taking office was to restore the hope to those who lost it during the early part of this decade , especially young Canadians .

Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) :

it is a quite imperfect comparison , but maybe the prime minister could explain to us why the unemployment rate in the United States is half what it is in Canada .
an hon. member :
those people will be less of a threat to our criminal justice system .
if there were a $ 1 billion cutback on personal income tax across the board , there would be 12,000 jobs created .
do not forget , my friends from Quebec , that as a Canadian I share your history and your dreams , and that I will share your future .
in an opinion submitted to the SQDM , some representatives of youth groups question the federal youth employment strategy , pointing out that if the federal - provincial agreement of April 21 , 1997 is a first step towards respecting the consensus in Quebec , the youth employment strategy put forward by the federal government goes in the opposite direction .
did any banks pay on that deficit ?
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) :
its incidence is 40 percent greater than that of breast cancer and only lung cancer kills more men than does prostate cancer .
Mr. Speaker , today the Supreme Court of Canada stated very clearly in a judgment it rendered that the meeting between Ted Thompson and Chief Justice Isaac which occurred on March 1 , 1996 was clearly inappropriate and breached the judicial independence of the courts .
if the CPP is going to be there for young generations , we have no choice but to start paying our way for the CPP now rather than passing on an insupportable burden to our children .
their attitudes could have significant consequences for society when our children and younger Canadians stand in our place and when it is their turn to make decisions affecting us .
therefore , the Government of Canada will provide increased support to the Canada Council and will make special efforts to support culture at home and to promote trade in Canadian cultural and educational products and services abroad .
is that agreed ?
does the member not think it is about time he recognized that he cannot ignore the majority ?
in fact the Government of Saskatchewan specifically allows a woman to sign away her rights to split her husband ' s CPP pension .

statements BY MEMBERS
national UNITY
farmers will have a direct role in shaping the operations and directions of the corporation .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
i know how they will respond .
resuming debate .
the National Assembly in Quebec City has voted overwhelmingly in favour of instituting linguistic school boards as soon as possible .
the federal , provincial and territorial governments will also continue to address the problem .
second , does it benefit all Canadians or cater to a special interest ?
reformers get sick .
we know the data is flawed and we know that readmission rates are not being tracked and that the women of this country are being left to pick up the pieces when patients are sent home too sick to look after themselves .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
this makes it almost impossible for the farmers to have access to the cars .
Canadians want to work but our current support system produces some strange results .
you can also count on me , as the new Bloc Quebecois critic on foreign affairs , to expose a government that puts its foreign policy at the service of national unity .
safe communities are among the hallmarks of our Canadian identity .
the amendments in the bill would also give the board of directors the power to exclude specific types , classes or varieties of wheat or barley from exclusive Canadian Wheat Board jurisdiction in the domestic or export market .
control and manipulation by government is what we should fear .
how does the Minister of Health intend to fulfil his legal duties under the food protection act if he has already eliminated the scientists who carry out those duties on his behalf ?
nonetheless we are here , opposition members from one point of view and government members from another , to debate the merits or demerits of the throne speech .
sadly the old school is so far barely letting the windows and doors crack open .
the first was that we were calling upon the federal government , since public finances are getting in better shape , to give back what it has swiped from the provinces , that is to say return the $ 4.5 billion it has stolen yearly from social programs in order to fund social assistance , postsecondary education and health .
i am pleased to know that the issue of sharing pension credits between two partners in a household will be on the agenda two years from now when the CPP is revisited .
i could read you dozens of statements made by foreign investors who say they are not worried about the political climate in Quebec .
with these and other measures , to be developed over the next few months in concert with the provinces , we will build on the progress made in the last budget to address the increasing cost of post - secondary education and the resulting debt burden on students .
no money has been spent on it , and today they want to transfer it to Charlevoix .
i would like to hear what he has to say on that .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay
i see a big grin .
the task of keeping together this country of ours , Canada , has to be our greatest priority .
the post - secondary caucus helped to ensure the future of post - secondary institutions and the hundreds of thousands of students were given high priority .
the plan will be fixed and I will be able to say to the next generation , to the young people of Thornhill and to the young people of Canada , that the Canada pension plan will be there for them in future generations .
the latter will be easier to achieve through the Canada pension plan investment board .
in his speech my hon. colleague said " we have to believe , we have to trust '' .
the Liberals were so concerned about projecting a positive image that they forgot that a code of ethics is not a makeup kit .
the hon. member sang a hymn of praise to team Canada and told us about all the wonderful things that happened as a result of its overseas missions .
for the two of us it cost 36 Deutschemarks .
some hon. members :
why ?
this bill represents a significant step toward preserving , as we said we would , the Canadian income and retirement system .
recently she brought to the front of the world stage the horrors of landmines and their tragic victims .
* * *
we have them here today as a testimonial .
it is time for the government to wake up and recognize that Canadians have a stake in this .
i am indeed delighted that the prime minister announced in his reply to the throne speech the millennium scholarship endowment fund .
in the meantime I ask our government to keep pressure on our friends south of the border to implement the amendments so that this controversial law will not cause havoc in border communities across Canada .
Mr. Mark Assad
the government is absolutely committed -
i am also honoured to stand before you as the recently appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry .
i think we should have a very serious debate on the matter .
Mr. Pat O ' Brien
we know from the draft , as it stands , that the MAI intends to drastically reduce the power of governments to intervene in the economy on behalf of the common good , the public interest , regional development , research and development and all the other ways in which governments have sought to act in the interests of the Canadian people .
i do not think the hon. member is rising on a point of order .
Mr. Grant Hill
Mr. Speaker , I could not answer that charge fully in 30 seconds .
these folks no longer show up in the official unemployment figures .
because of the difficulties of the problems being dealt with and the machinery they had to work with , they have become utterly cynical about whether there is anything they can do .
i would like to hear from the member of the Reform Party on where he stands on that .
this success can be attributed directly to the unselfish effort of highly skilled and dedicated search and rescue personnel .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak in support of the motion to strike a parliamentary committee to review the proposed constitutional amendment to reorganizing Quebec ' s school boards along linguistic lines .
one good example is the career edge initiative which demonstrates the private sector ' s commitment to helping youth .
we have committed 50 percent of any surplus to reinvestments in building a stronger society .
the hon. member for Macleod .
maintaining what is good , and improving what has been degraded , requires constant effort .
when we look at the bill we see a feeble attempt to appear to be reforming the Canadian Wheat Board without any real or substantive changes required to make real reform a reality .
there may be such groups , but the majority of Albertans in the consultation done with every household in the province came down four square for using that money to get rid of the mortgage on our future and our children ' s future .
the government has represented Canadians with an integration plan of action , a measured and deliberate plan .
we are giving work experience to young Canadians who might not otherwise have access to the workforce .
we have women , minority groups , individuals of differing sexual orientation all struggling to be accorded their basic human rights .
i draw his attention to the magnificent passage written by Claude Castonguay recently , taking Quebec ' s premier to task for breaking with Quebeckers ' great tradition of pragmatism in matters of social union , for not following in the steps of people like Jean Lesage and Robert Bourassa , who worked for the well - being of Quebeckers .
i , on behalf of my constituents , look for your assistance in the pursuit of serving Canadians .
we need a strong economy but it cannot and should not be the absolute in and of itself .
in particular , I have felt a great deal of consternation at the spectacle of hundreds of locked out security guards .
Mr. Speaker , when a warrant is issued , the reasons are stated on it .
our young people of today are our future of tomorrow .
what did we get instead ?
i conclude by commenting on the the dry bones throne speech once again .
Mrs. Maud Debien ( Laval East , BQ ) :
i would also like to take the opportunity to thank the people in my riding of Acadie - Bathurst for their support and their trust in the June 2 federal election .
the fact I am here as the member for Algoma - Manitoulin is due to the voters of my riding who expressed their support in me .
( division 3 )
the Chair rose because on that occasion , in the opinion of the Chair , the hon. member for Portage - Lisgar was straying from relevance to the bill on debate .
my question is a furtherance of a question brought forward by the hon. member from Saint John .
this is vitally important to high technology companies in Nepean - Carleton , the national capital region and , indeed , the entire country .
the Speaker :
Mr. Greg Thompson
my colleagues in their discussion of the speech from the throne and in legislation that comes before this House will endeavour to bring that muscle , sinew , tissue , spirit and body required to add some substance to the dry bones on economic recovery contained in the throne speech .
Mr. Speaker , to the best of my knowledge , no .
the money belongs to us and not to the government .
i think it is an important comparison .
Mr. John Harvard ( Charleswood - Assiniboine , Lib . ) :
bill C - 2 moves us partially toward a private plan .
Mr. John Reynolds
Cecilia and Tammy Grono were shot to death in front of Tammy ' s 2 and 4 - year old children .
it was the high interest rates , and now we have the lowest interest rates in 35 years and doing a remarkable job .
first , the Canada pension plan is in serious trouble .
there is great dissatisfaction and the polls are showing that .
what hypocrisy we are seeing from the Reform Party .
that is very serious .
Denturists received legal recognition as a profession in Canada in 1961 .
health PROTECTION BRANCH
when the Mulroney Tories tried to invoke closure on the GST , the Liberals cried bloody murder .
foreign AFFAIRS
the most vital criterion should be script quality .
an amendment was moved , a subamendment was moved and right after the subamendment was moved the government gave notice of closure .
we now have a more equitable system , a fairer system that takes people off a certain unfortunate form of dependency to help them get back into the labour market .
Mr. Minister , the ceasefire called for -
i have a copy of that draft report with me .
what we have seen this week is but the tip of the iceberg .
this flows from the government ' s election promise and from its throne speech of last week .
madam Speaker , all I indicated on behalf of the NDP was that we supported sending this to the committee so that all the various concerns could be examined .
Mr. Nelson Riis :
Mr. Speaker , like the member from the Conservative Party , I was a crown attorney for many years and we were trained to be very precise in our answers .
pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order 110 ( 1 ) these are deemed referred to the appropriate standing committees , a list of which is attached .
the government , egged on by the Reform Party , is standing aside to let it happen .
that seems to be implicit in this .

Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner :
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
all of us in this House had better dedicate ourselves to making sure that the electorate knows what kind of robbery this is for our young people .
if something goes wrong during the term of this government it is the fault of the past government .
they have not even heard the question yet .
the impact of these new technologies is changing the way we relate to one another .
if we continue with projects like this one , we will have a hodgepodge of agreements all across the country if we do not have a national highway funding program .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
Atom Egoyan was the most decorated film maker at this year ' s Cannes International Film Festival , with The Sweet Hereafter taking home three awards , including the Grand Prix , the highest international honour ever awarded to a Canadian feature film .
Mr. Speaker , I rise to tell hon. members about an exciting event that will take place in my riding of Sault Ste. Marie next year .
it is an important initiative .
earlier today we heard a member from the NDP talk about fairness in taxation .
the three pillars which the government sees are the Canada pension plan , the old age security and guaranteed income supplement , which will be replaced by the seniors benefit , and the registered retirement savings plan provision for tax assisted private savings .
nobody would want to save anymore for their retirement anymore .
when we add to that the debts and unfunded liabilities of provincial governments , local governments and other pension plans for public servants , we find my generation will be inheriting over $ 2 trillion in public indebtedness and liabilities .
for Canadians , the start of the new millennium represents an historic opportunity to celebrate our achievements as a nation and our hopes for the future .
there is no change to the maximum pensionable earnings .
hon. Jane Stewart :
there are a couple of quick things I would like to ask the member .
Mr. Speaker , most of the points raised by the member opposite speak to the need of the government to provide good conservation and management of the fisheries .
that is why it is a priority for me and this government to put forward the case for Canada and to remind people around the world that the country the UN found to be the best place to live is also one of the best places to work and to invest .
we could not afford the deficit and the ballooning effect on the debt .
that is all they ask .
i had the opportunity to actually speak to the commissioners of the Canadian Wheat Board .
they speak of it in terms of motherhood and apple pie .
we must ensure that we maintain a well - motivated , professional , non - partisan and efficient public service .
throughout the past year as a member of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs I was part of a group committed to studying the youth justice system .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
does the hon. member wish to clarify his comment that this is a minor adjustment ?
in fact if old age security , the OAS and the CPP are combined , in 1995 about 5.3 percent of the national income went into those two plans .
Mrs. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) :

it is time to reconcile Canada and Quebec in a new kind of partnership , a novel form of union between genuine sovereign states .
hon. Allan Rock
when we look at the various benefits that are attached to the CPP people can expect over the next number of years to have about a 10 percent reduction in the level of benefits .
now it is our generation ' s turn to become nation builders .
Mr. Jack Ramsay
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the hon. member ' s comments with interest .
the Government of Canada can help them by bringing together those who can best provide these services .
with low interest rates there was little value to be gained from building up large reserve funds .
it is for that reason that we put forward the amendment to lengthen the timeframe for the committee until December 31 , 1997 , to ensure that all Quebeckers who have a desire to make a representation before the committee have the opportunity to do so .
why ?
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
it was agreed between the Minister of Justice at the time and the lawyers at the moment of settlement that the bills would be presented and those that were justified were to be paid and they have been paid .
i will do my best to obtain it for my hon. colleague .
the Reform Party is attempting to suggest that a balanced approach would be fiscally irresponsible .
resumption OF DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS IN REPLY
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner :
Canadians realize that it is imperative for them to begin planning for retirement in advance .
we took opposing positions in the Meech Lake debate .
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) :
as for linguistic school boards , because that is what this is all about , the resolution says that religious beliefs have no bearing on the way Quebec will be organized or the selection of an administrative or management method .
one - third of Canada ' s population , 9.8 million people , are now turning 50 .
he was , like I , a Nova Scotian .
it is a matter of semantics .
we are at this moment in communication with the authorities in Israel and in Jordan to find out if it is true .
the government programs that have been put in place for the last three years have hurt us dramatically .
we point out the horrendous impact of the debt .
we also have to understand that we need to build a new fiscal relationship structurally different from the one we have now and more reflective of the need for predictable funding in an ocean of fiscal transfers .
it will have access to expertise and knowledge throughout the country .
it was put to the people during the electoral campaign and the majority of Canadians voted for the platform , as is evidenced by the composition of the House .
that is exactly what the farmers do not want and that is not what the farmers on their survey of western Canada said .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
the Speaker :
does the minister not find it embarrassing to have to tell so many citizens who have so much need that they cannot access training programs simply because of a shortage of money while he is sitting on $ 12.8 billion of their money .
second , today when a judge sentences a first degree murderer and says this crime is so heinous that this individual may not have the opportunity for parole for 25 years , what do those words mean ?
it has yet to be determined whether this is the right amending formula to be used in this case .
do members agree that we can reduce the deficit without cutting aid to the most disadvantaged and that we should continue to eliminate waste ?
the Bloc Quebecois lost more than 500,000 votes altogether .
i said during my speech at the very beginning that I would like to be on record as a young Canadian supporting a strong , fully funded retirement income system which ensures that no Canadians fall between the cracks in their older years .
i urge all my colleagues in this House to support the motion before us .
at approximately 75 percent of our gross domestic product the current level of debt is inoperative and must continue to come down .
it was far more detailed and more balanced than the one we heard a few minutes ago from the representative of the Reform Party , which expressed almost universal radicalism .
one company was kind enough to notify the minister and complain about a practice it found unacceptable .
request FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE
i would like the member to respond to that , if she can .
madam Speaker , in the context of the government ' s overall program I do not think there is any question that over the last four years the government would have liked to have spent money on areas related to children and youth and aboriginals and other areas of society that in many respects have been neglected .
citizens of the Stony reserve apparently accompanied him .
however , the Bloc Quebecois will not hesitate to condemn the positions of a government that constantly reduces its official development assistance , or whose approach is inconsistent as regards the linkage of human rights and international trade .
there is no excuse for this and I want to ask -
we will never jeopardize that achievement and the benefits that it has brought , low interest rates , impressive economic growth , hundreds of thousands of new jobs .
the fact of the matter is permission must be sought of the individual .
there will be a quarterly report which will show where their money has been invested .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom :
if we take $ 750 annually in additional payments out of each person ' s pocket , that removes a lot of disposable income from our citizens .
and the best way for them to get work is to ensure that the businesses in Quebec that feel they want to expand feel they will be able to survive in a very healthy , stable marketplace and not one that is under a constant cloud of separation .
WHITBY WARRIORS
those who advocate scrapping the CPP and moving to a privatized system with mandatory retirement savings plans do not understand two things .
what does that say of the support it has for its programs ?
the people who play there pay and that helps .
Ms. Susan Whelan :
debate is on the subamendment .
specifically I would like to thank the voters of Mississauga West for their confidence in sending me to Ottawa to represent them in this place .
there are desperate young people coming into my office who are being hounded by collection agencies to pay off their student loans .
as I reflect on both my colleague John English and Sharon Hayes , I can say that there is very much a sense of family values in the Chamber .
even during the last couple of months in Regina he was always very keen on ensuring that New Democrats represented citizens well in parliament .
i am hugely disappointed at the refusal by the members of the Bloc Quebecois to set aside their political goals and support a francophone from outside Quebec .
i want to assure all my constituents that I have ample access and little restrictions with regard to my input in voicing their comments or concerns to our government .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed . )
these changes in the CPP reflect the long held Liberal values of providing stability for and protecting those in need .
Mr. Inky Mark
- parliament , Vote 10
the petitioners state that in their opinion 38 percent of Canada ' s national highways are in substandard condition , that the United States and Mexico are engaged in the repair of their national highway systems and Canada should do likewise for the obvious benefits of job creation , lower congestion and better traffic flow .
if they are interested in the truth they should listen .
there are many pension plans facing the same challenges .
Canadians from all parts of our country are volunteering their time , money and compassion to increase public awareness of this disease .
crime PREVENTION
when I hear of the demands of the opposition that we should move away from a Canada pension plan and toward a system of RRSPs I have to remind the House that RRSPs do not have the great benefits that are shared by those who participate in the Canada pension plan .
then we managed to lower the annual deficit from 8.4 or 8.6 percent of the GDP in 1984 to almost half of that .
it would appear to me that the hon. member , who I believe is an accountant and well acquainted with actuarial concepts , may not have done exhaustive research on this subject .
it is rather despicable to see the Minister of Finance and government members place their hands on their hearts and talk about the plight of children , given that they themselves are responsible for a situation which has gotten worse over the last three years .
unfortunately for them , the Prime Minister has decided to dodge the embarrassing issue and take refuge behind the RCMP investigation .
i will give them 60 seconds .
this being my first opportunity to give a speech in the House during this Parliament , I want to take the opportunity to say thanks to my constituents for returning me to the House of Commons for a third term .
satellite DISHES
they should have known and anticipated this bubble in the demographic trends .
all the low and middle income people live in those houses .
all of a sudden I saw Liberals waving $ 5,000 cheques and saying " Vote for the Liberals and you will get compensation .
in all of this let me assure the House that our objective as a government will be not only to maintain medicare but to preserve it .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel ( Secretary of State ( Science , Research and Development ) ( Western Economic Diversification ) , Lib . ) :
national Unity
there seems to be something wrong with some of the basic logic .
maybe the member of the opposition went to the school of Orwellian politics , doublespeak .
they want a country where youth and adults can find gainful decent employment , a country where young people can realize their dreams .
i suppose Canadian merchants will be happy to know that this prime minister ' s government is keeping up its outrageous spending habits .
Mr. Speaker , I have a petition signed by constituents in my riding who ask that the prime minister and the Parliament of Canada declare and confirm immediately that Canada is indivisible , that the boundaries of Canada , its provinces , territories and territorial waters may be modified only by a free vote of all Canadian citizens as guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or through the amending formula as stipulated in the Canadian Constitution .
comments During Question Period
i think the last thing that any of us would want , whether we talk about the people in Quebec or people from outside Quebec , is for an amendment like this to pass through the Quebec assembly and to pass through this Parliament and then to have it be overturned in the courts as unconstitutional .
while the job creation figures are impressive , 947,000 jobs since October 1993 , and while many of these jobs are well paying , full time jobs , in my riding where unemployment remains too high , this is little consolation .
premier Tobin seized upon the public frustration and called a referendum .
i hope the government will learn .
yea .
a simple yes or no .
basically we want to know if the federal government agreed to allow $ 113 million of untendered contracts to go through and , if so , why .
it demonstrates without hesitation or equivocation how taxation or any barrier placed by government on small and medium size business , especially in a trading environment , prevents jobs .
we certainly need a larger portion of elected people who are going to represent those they are selling the grain for .
the hon. member for T 茅 miscamingue on a point of order .
this government owes it to the people of Canada and to the future of medicare to ensure that our cash transfer payments for health care reflect the needs of health care , ensure that we are able to meet our obligations and that every Canadian is able to gain access to the best quality care in this country by virtue of being a member of a civilized country .
the bottom line is that they went out and bought Japanese cars .
where is the parallel bill ?
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
that is a commitment the minister has yet to make .
this motion if adopted by the government would enable us to save the lives of hundreds of people in the country who are waiting for organ donations , some of whom are in the House today .
Abitibi covers 802,000 square kilometres , and has 92,000 inhabitants , 68 communities and 68 mayors .
Mr. Art Hanger
our citizens watch us daily and frequently they do not like what they see .
it was brought about by cutting the legs out from under the workers who were doing important jobs in their communities .
today is a rather special day for us in the House for a reason other than question period .
we are simply standing before you , Mr. Speaker , to claim the right to consider government public bills first in this place .
a very detailed analysis has been made that teams of officials have been pouring over to make sure that we get the best value for the Canadian taxpayer .
however , the Bloc Quebecois demands - I repeat , demands - that administration of the CPP be rapidly modernized in order to meet the harsh criticism recently formulated by the auditor general with respect to this plan .
an arbitrary boundary ?
supply
i would like to know what measures the government plans to take to alleviate this problem .
without this we will never get that opportunity to see our hopes and dreams reflected .
the year ' s basic exemptions , the first $ 3,500 of earnings , is no longer indexed to inflation which means that the low income workers , many of whom are women , would have to pay more in contributions .
the only difficulty is the contrast .
the member ' s last point was on dispute mechanisms .
they are engaged in information technology , environmental technologies , biotechnologies , aerospace and telecommunications technology .
last week the prime minister defended his government ' s handouts : $ 42,000 for a Latin song book , $ 100,000 for a military golf course , and $ 19,000 for golf balls .
today the auditor general gave us the straight goods .
a second concern for the committee is to ensure that the amendment meets the test of the rule of law .
i know many of my constituents are still apprehensive about their personal safety and their concerns are being addressed through crime prevention programs .
the cries for tax relief from Canadian families are dismissed by the Liberals .
and we will try to do it as Stanley Knowles would have done it , with honour and dignity and integrity .
did he talk about job creation and economic recovery ?
i thank the hon. member for Wild Rose for his intervention and for bringing this matter to our attention .
they will be running , walking and jogging in support of breast cancer research .
it did not have the courage to restructure government .
an amount exceeding $ 10,000 .
they are ripping up labour contracts and denying people their basic rights .
my government will enter into discussion with the provinces aimed at a comprehensive overhaul of our pension system -

the member for Saint John claims that we do not have a quorum .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to second what the member for Sarnia - Lambton and the member for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve said .
when I hear the Leader of the Opposition make an extravagant statement like that , I say he should wait for the investigation to finish .
the federal government is neither party to nor responsible for Nova Scotia ' s public - private agreement with the developer .
we know that lobbyists for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of Canada , which is fighting to scrap a national drug plan , are coming from former employees of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board .
will it be used to benefit our economy and our standard of living ?
i must confess I do not have a good sense of exactly where they sit on some of these issues .
i wish the hon. members across the floor could understand this .
prayers
in Canada , the arts play a leading role in enabling Canadians to define themselves in relation to one another and to the rest of the world .
it is only logical that if we point to small businesses being the cornerstone of our domestic economy , if we speak to small businesses creating the jobs in all of our communities , it stands to reason that by increasing and encouraging more small businesses to join our large ones on the international field we will reap the very same benefits that these enterprises give our communities domestically .
tax reform is extraordinarily important .
the federal government is experiencing many difficulties in implementing its disability benefit .
i can also tell you that we are watching the system ' s results very closely but we feel that , for the time being , it is in the interest of Canadians to move from passive to active measures within the system .
consider Aaron Fyke , a 25 year old resident in my riding , who writes : " Please explain to me that I am not simply funding someone else ' s retirement at the expense of my own '' .
but right now , the Liberal government seems to be favouring a formula that would once again shift the responsibility onto the provinces , which would be left with the dirty job of making cuts in health , education and social programs because the federal government has apparently decided to use funds earmarked for the provinces to repay its debts .
i am very grateful for the vision and direction of my colleague , the Minister of Finance .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
however , for this to be successful , the federal government should not meddle in these areas .
Mr. David Chatters
however the Reform Party also believes that the majority has an interest in minority rights .
points OF ORDER
a Reform government would hold a binding national referendum on capital punishment .
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy - Royal , PC ) :
family ties are precious things , whether it be in our families at home where parents and children work together for the common good or in our Canadian family .
after the next Quebec provincial election we will be faced with one of two prospects : one , a federalist government in Quebec which will require that Canadians be prepared for another constitutional initiative or two , a separatist government which will require Canadians to be prepared for another separatist referendum .
it starts to change the economy in Atlantic Canada .
if the hon. member for Wild Rose feels he has some additional facts , new facts , that he has not laid on the table already to add to this discussion , then of course I would recognize him at this time .
we want to be able to say now to the government , in various public ways , what it is it should be insisting on in those negotiations .
i commend my colleagues on their achievements .
Mr. John Reynolds
madam Speaker , my bill is quite straightforward .
i thank my constituents for the privilege of representing them at this crucial point in the future of Canada and Nunavut .
a new term 17 to amend the Constitution of Canada is something that is very important to the people of my province .
many of my constituents are federal public servants .

props have been mentioned .
this fall more than 100 nations will come to Ottawa to sign a treaty banning forever the use of anti - personnel landmines .
we talk about what to do with the " surplus '' , the government ' s prize at the end of three and a half years of starving Canadians and at the end of 13 years of women fighting for equal pay .
i too look forward to working with him in seeing that this government is held accountable .
he commented on the suffering of Cape Bretoners faced with an unemployment rate of 17 percent .
what Montreal retains is the true essence of Canada ' s multicultural make - up .
Mr. Jack Ramsay
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
my question is for the Prime Minister .
Mr. Speaker , on behalf of my colleagues in the New Democratic Party , I would like to pay my respects to the memory of J . Chester MacRae .
this is a marketing agency that must be able to assume its deficits in the long term if there are annual losses .
it is a wonderful opportunity for the House to make submissions to the government .
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) :
if you understand pyramid schemes or the chain letter concept , then you will understand the concept of the CPP design .
while members opposite enjoy parliamentary privilege day after day in the House of Commons , they would have farmers be susceptible to prosecution regardless of how frivolous the charge .
Quebec ' s National Assembly acted on that desire for change by unanimously passing , on April 15 , 1997 , the resolution to amend section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 , with respect to its application to Quebec .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :

" the House of Martin Guerre " a critically acclaimed production by Canadian composer Leslie Arden , brings people not only to the Canadian Stage Company but also to the restaurants , bars and hotels nearby .
these allegations of influence peddling are extremely important .
i am part of an honest , sincere group of colleagues who are competent and ready to govern and who are ready to inspire to take this country to a new level of democratic freedom , justice and social and economic prosperity .
Mr. Chuck Strahl
i would like to make it clear to the former Leader of the Opposition that , at the first ministers ' meeting in June last year , all the provincial governments and premiers in attendance , including the Premier of Quebec , agreed to our establishing a child credit program to help poor families .
we are not going through simple machinations .
i recently returned from Bosnia - Hercegovina where tensions still run deep .
but what has this Liberal government been saying to us now that we are facing the prospect of a surplus ?
i also want to remind the minister that when I was vice - chairman of the committee , I had the privilege of presenting a motion that was accepted by the government , as a result of which we spent three years examining the whole issue of AIDS .
yet there is a sense of urgency because of the fierce competition that exists at the international level in the area of research and development .
i decided to put off any action until the end of question period .
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
they have not changed their minds .
i am wondering what his position is .
i find not only depressing but sad that they do not realize the harm they are doing to others , outside Quebec , who do not share their interests .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau ( Repentigny , BQ ) :
that member must not for one moment suggest that his party has even close to the amount of support and credibility that we have with the aboriginal people .
i am referring to a national longitudinal survey we have been doing for several years .
* * *
it is absolutely vital that Canada continues to look outward not inward , because if the world moves without you - and make no mistake that the global march is very much on - then who really gets left behind ?
it is a humbling experience to stand in this great Chamber of democratic deliberation for the first time and experience what the veterans are familiar with .
we only protect what is weak .
we have given Canada our artists and our musicians .
we realize that in order to be strong we have to deal with the issue of separation and national unity .
we must , in particular , protect the accumulated moneys against the erosion caused by the price increase which , for many years , Canada , like the other countries of the world , has been unable to avoid .
this is the boost they need to overcome this lack of experience and thus meet employers ' requirements .
today , together , parents , communities and governments must assure the barriers are not so high that young Canadians do not make it to the other side of the fence .
it is time that this government finally came down on the side of fiscal responsibility , growth , hope and opportunity for Canadians by providing them with real meaningful tax relief .
it was an occasion for all of us to remember that part of the reason why we live in this secure and safe society is because of the dedication of professional police and peace officers who work across this country .
of course , I do not have to remind the House how much the objectives of our parties differ .
as the minister has stated to the member , the government ' s only involvement is to match the funding provided by the province .
the federal government retains considerable control over the board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board .
that is our plan .
i will say one thing .
they are willing to take the write - offs for RRSP , increase the limits radically so that wealthy people can make a lot more money and let the poor wander around all by themselves .
we do believe in ensuring a sustainable future for the Canada pension plan .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday in the House the solicitor general denied any knowledge of an RCMP criminal investigation into the Liberal Party of Canada fund raising practices , despite the fact that his cabinet colleague , the Minister of Human Resources Development , brought the matter to the attention of the RCMP six months prior .
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) :
in 1996 , seniors groups met at a summit in my riding .
i also remind the hon. member that the role of government is not to balance the budget as an end in itself .
they are the people who are going to be affected by this the most but let us also include seniors who have children and grandchildren .
Mr. Monte Solberg :
knowing this , will the prime minister clarify how the Calgary declaration will be communicated to the people of Quebec and by whom ?
the leadership within the Indian community has , for the most part , been responsible and moderate .
introduction and first reading
it is tremendously important to know that our great country with its millions of square kilometres will be the most connected country in the world by the millennium .
the Israeli government was not in a position to reply to the government but it communicated with the Minister of Foreign Affairs as soon as possible , according to what the minister of foreign affairs of Israel said to my colleague .
those individuals have shared their opinions with me .
in either case the decision making authority lies where it should be , directly with producers themselves .
Mr. Mac Harb
he said " Tell everyone that we will make Ottawa rock '' .
the access to information people are now at the point where they will have to proceed to court to try to get this stuff , because the member of Parliament cannot represent the people who sent him here .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is with appreciation and admiration that I pay tribute to the millions of Canadians celebrating the international day of older persons .
therefore the government ' s throne speech in view of this reasonable standard is a disappointment , especially from a justice system perspective .
before I conclude my remarks I would like to repeat those tests which the committee must address .
for decades the Canadian Wheat Board has earned the confidence of farmers because they knew that they would all be treated equitably in the purchase of their grain .
the principles of Canadian parliamentary law are : to protect a minority and restrain the improvidence or tyranny of a majority ; to secure the transaction of public business in an orderly manner ; to enable every member to express opinions within limits necessary to preserve decorum and prevent an unnecessary waste of time ; to give abundant opportunity for the consideration of every measure , and to prevent any legislative action being taken upon sudden impulse .
Mr. Jason Kenney
cultural GRANTS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ACT
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan :
why is acting like a hypocrite ?
second , why does his department totally disregard the very high level of satisfaction of its managers with the current location of the employment centre ?
the CMA was born on October 9 , 1867 , under the leadership of Dr. William Marsden , who was soon considered to be the father of this association .
it is another thing to see the law itself create that feeling where the peace of mind is destroyed , where they cannot be at peace knowing that the justice officials are not going to interfere with the judicial independence of a judge that they may have to appear before and that they will get a fair hearing , that the individual who commits a crime will be punished in a manner according to the circumstances surrounding the offence .
only British Columbia and Saskatchewan abstained .
it is now 6.15 p.m. and we are out of time .
Canadians believe that governments can play a positive role , but that role does not involve handouts to profitable corporations .
canada ' s initiatives to ban antipersonnel land mines , promote human rights and protect the environment are definitely good measures and will get the Bloc Quebecois ' support when , as in the previous Parliament , we feel they are compatible with Quebec ' s interests and those of the international community as a whole .
the Reform Party and hopefully some of the new parties might bear that in mind .
my question is obvious .
trade is a tenet of our party ' s policy .
Mr. Speaker , that is precisely why the multiculturalism program exists .
Mr. Speaker , His Excellency the Governor General desires the immediate attendance of this honourable House in the Chamber of the Senate .
the Speaker
this has gone on now almost 15 or 20 minutes over the allotted period .
what action did he take from that point on to ensure that neither he nor his ministers were compromised during the election campaign with someone about whom there were serious suspicions and who was under investigation by the RCMP ?
i urge people over 50 in my riding of Brampton Centre and throughout Canada to add at least one extra serving of dairy products to their daily menu to help keep their bones and teeth strong .
is that an insensitive way to spend money ?
how are Newfoundlanders expected to participate in this new economy when his department in Newfoundland is completely devoid of any funds for the rest of this fiscal year ?
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
i am pleased with the government ' s commitment to build on this success with a focused strategy .
Mr. Eug 猫 ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) :
i do not believe this is good enough .
he appears to believe that this plan can go on indefinitely without some sort of a restructuring of how to finance it .
Mr. Louis Plamondon :
members
first by increasing contribution rates now , they will not have to rise to the much higher levels predicted for future generations .
* * *
to secure our future as a society , our immediate challenge is to make sure that our young generation makes a successful transition to the world of work , that young people who want to continue to learn have access to education , and that young people who found it difficult getting started in the workplace get a second chance .
we know that .
that is what the specificity of Quebec is all about .
consumer AFFAIRS
nay .
and I hate to think what Quebec would be like now .
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett
why ?
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) :
he is far too arrogant to suggest that therefore he has permission to vote a certain way on every single issue that comes up in this House .
i want to be very clear on the record that this is not a tax issue .
my constituents and in particular the small business community have expressed this to me .
we will continue to be frank and open about the consequences of what those who seek to partition Canada are proposing .
it will report to Canadian contributors .
i think we should have better service than that .
i am waiting for his answer .
if we meet this challenge , if we restore the confidence of Canadians in the public system of health care , if we ensure that our part of the public bargain is kept then we will have achieved what I believe is within our grasp , the achievement of a generation .
Mr. John Finlay
the reason I ask that is I have been here for four years now and cannot understand why law and order is not more of a priority for this government .
you probably know that , as a party , the Bloc Quebecois believe it is important not to have financial ties with business or corporate interests .
Mr. Jason Kenney
i would like to ask the party leader who spoke these words to withdraw them .
the government has done nothing to act on that .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday in the Speech from the Throne , the Prime Minister wanted , he said , to launch an appeal to citizens to work together to save Canada , except that nothing about the speech is likely to please Quebec .
* * *
i have given the reasons .
however , we have to make the necessary changes to ensure that the Canada pension plan is there in perpetuity .
Mr. Speaker , are the minister and the government insensitive to the pain and suffering inflicted upon these families ?
personally speaking , I am one from a family of ten .
i have heard very few complaints about the plan not being effective .
we do not believe in passive income support .
whether it be textiles , tourism , retail sales or home care , there are businesses doing well and hiring people .
while the government through words says that it shares this pain and wants to do something about it , when given the opportunity to act decisively it consistently fails to demonstrate the vision these young people need .
madam Speaker , there is certainly a place within the criminal justice system , within the corrections system , for rehabilitation .
each and every one of these promises has not been fulfilled and to this date I would suggest they have been broken .
not only did Chester MacRae serve Canada and Parliament but he was a decorated war veteran who served in both England and France , having participated in the D - Day invasion of France .

this is the same bill that I introduced in the last Parliament and which was passed unanimously by the House and sent to the other place where it was also referred to committee and then unfortunately died an unnatural death because of the call of the election .

with this I am going to recognize the hon. Leader of the Opposition .
some hon. members :
we need to ensure that campaign fundraising activities are no longer shrouded in obscurity .

the recent bikers war in Quebec underscores that organized crime is not something intangible , something that happens in dark alleys hidden from view , but can and does have a direct impact on our neighbourhoods .

there is probably a riot in front of your office of people saying " please move them in '' .
Ms. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr 芒 ce - Lachine , Lib . ) :
this represents just over 100,000 jobs that would have been created if payroll taxes had not been increased .
Mr. Peter Adams
like all children do , I learned from their words and their deeds .
one of the difficulties happens to be that we may not always find ourselves on the same side of an issue as our constituents .
Mr. Speaker , it is finally clear why the officials of the health department were digging around in Dr. Brill - Edwards ' file .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Justice .
she is prepared to take her money and let somebody else spend it for her more wisely than she is able to spend it .
subsequently it was decided that it would be more appropriate if provisions in the CWB act relating to the duties of directors and officers were the same as those in the Canada Business Corporations Act which applies to private sector corporations .
yes it is true the deficit has come down .
i would like to speak today about how the Liberal government has set forth a bold plan to lead the country into the next millennium , a plan that will benefit Canadians and the people of Perth - Middlesex .
Ms. Alexa McDonough
the CPP must be changed now if it is to provide pensions in the future .
Mr. Werner Schmidt
Mr. Speaker , on the same question of privilege , I think you should give positive consideration to the proposed motion because , in our evolving parliamentary system , it is extremely important to give more authority to the elected and less to those who are backward - looking and who do not reflect today ' s reality .
the point of having a common investment policy was to attempt , with the help of the best people in the field , whose integrity was absolute , to maximize the rate of return on the public ' s investment and achieve a better balance between safe and high yield investments .
it is made up of all the town of Whitby including the heritage village of Brookland and the southern portion of the town of Ajax .

if there is question about how a committee proceeds , I suggest to all hon. members the matter should be raised in committee so that they provide for this information to be available one way or another , if they feel it is needed at some future time .
the Deputy Speaker :
they did not have time , like the tax - funded special interest group friends of the government to come before those hearings and to ask for more money from their grandchildren and great grandchildren .
speech FROM THE THRONE
we want to wish him well .
for the past two decades Canadian governments have been tearing apart the social programs that men like Woodsworth , Knowles and Cyril Keeper fought to put in place .
Mr. David Iftody
he certainly did not return with the majority that he was hoping for .
it is a bit of an intimidating experience .
they were not given that option .
moving Forward into the 21 st Century
if there are members in the House who still think they can justify a CPP pension of $ 9,000 per year after 35 years of payments , they had better give their heads a shake .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
since then we have built retirement income , old age security , guaranteed income supplements , the CPP and public assistance to the tune of $ 14 billion a year to people ' s private retirement savings which has ensured each and every Canadian a retirement income which allows them to live at a modest level of dignity .
i do not know if it comes from being a woman , but her image is completely different from that of the former Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , who came across as very aggressive .
he said " A politician plans for the next election '' .
where there is no vision , the people get out of hand ; blessed are they who keep the precept .
i spent four years in this place listening to this government make commitments to maintain existing regulations once a mining company has invested substantially in a mining project .
i think they are trying to use smoke and mirrors .
it was more likely the vision of Lester B . Pearson that he carried abroad than the Conservative vision of things .
Mrs. Pauline Picard
just because they have the name Reform in their party title does not mean they are the only MPs who seek reform .
twelve days later the affected research labs are still sitting idle , knowledgeable scientists are leaving the country and Canadians are unprotected in the event of a bacteria attack in Canada ' s food system .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , the liberal member for Bourassa gave another very subtle analysis of the national question and its impact on the economy .
i think this is wonderful , but what is not so wonderful is that some Canadians would destroy our country for purely selfish reasons .
the failures of past and present government policies have driven them to complete despair and destroyed their proud and historical way of life .
we have to address that issue in this Parliament and I think we have had a good start with some of the recent statistics and job creation figures that we have had in that area .
unlike the 29 proposals found in the throne speech , these are changes that do not cost the government money .
Mr. Jim Abbott
Mr. Regan landed on his feet .
the University of Toronto boasts one of the world ' s greatest programs in astrophysics and with continued support , not only from the federal government but also from committed private supporters , I am sure we can look forward to maintaining Canada ' s leading edge discoveries and contributions to international space exploration .
Mr. Bernard Patry
what is incredible is that the situation at the federal level has not changed .
they should be able to do their business and not do things which are contrary to the laws of Canada as has been suggested , not to do things which are contrary to the best interests of farmers .
too often , requests for information are not responded to in a timely manner .
hon. Jane Stewart
it is also critical to my riding of Peace River and its economy .
the truth is the Conservative Party has been making all kinds of innuendoes , all kinds of false accusations , God knows for what purposes , but the fact is there is somebody under investigation .
the Government will work with its provincial partners and other interested parties to improve Canadian health information systems to improve decision making about health and health care across the country .
policing OF AIRPORTS
it has been brought our attention that pilotage charges are expensive .
i am hoping that with co - operation from all sides we can do the same and get it through the House this time .
the good news as we are pulling out a difficult period of downsizing is that while putting our house in order to reduce our costs , we have also changed our methods and approaches in order to get better results .
Mr. Paul Steckle ( Huron - Bruce , Lib . ) :
when it started making cuts to transfers , to social programs , to health , to education and to social assistance , the government talked about devolution and about respecting the powers of the provinces .
the Speaker :
i would remind the member , who is drawing a pension on top of his salary , that he cannot use props .
can the hon. parliamentary secretary explain how the new board of directors themselves will be held accountable to the farmers who elect them when they will not be able to tell them anything about the top secret Canadian Wheat Board operations ?
the changes reflect the long held Liberal values of providing stability for and protecting those in need .
i should also point out that the Canada community investment program has been an endeavour which 20 communities across this country , and all provinces and territories have at least one , have been using to improve access to capital .
i am absolutely convinced that is true .
taking into account inflation and any possible changes in policies , today ' s young Canadians are faced with small or even negative real returns on their retirement investment under the Canada pension plan .
recently once again , the newspapers have reported - and this was really not a new discovery , since the auditor general has been saying so since 1993 , without the government doing anything about it - that the auditor general has spoken out against the fact that they are trying to put a new computer program in place for processing the old age and income security pensions .
when I look at the bill I am reminded that we are dealing with the principal source of income of people who are no longer in a position to add to their income .
we express this responsibility by the questions we pose in committee .
Mr. Speaker , my supplementary question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
hon. Allan Rock
governing is about making choices and sometimes these choices are difficult .
this built - in disincentive is called the welfare wall .
he asked if the people of Cape Breton have often sent the wrong people to represent them .
it stands to reason .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
either cabinet has no confidence in him - in which case it would be very difficult for the Solicitor General to do any sort of sensitive work if his cabinet colleagues did not trust him - or the Solicitor General is not on top of the issues .
liberals do not seek to avoid tough choices , we face them head on .
it was a Canadian who invented the telephone , although considering the fact that I have two teenagers , I am not so sure about that invention for the time being .
that is what he has not understood and he has not understood that the throne speech addresses it directly .
i think the suggestion was made somehow that people who cut taxes do not necessarily increase the employment of people .
second , the hon. member spoke about the contributions made in Abitibi in 1993 .
let me say that I too welcome the debate on what the government is going to do with greater revenues as a result of a growing economy .
some hon. members :
in its 40 years it has gone from mud and dreams to an institution of excellence and world renown .
i want to assure my constituents and all Canadians that this is not simply a cost saving measure .
i would also like to correct the hon. member on her position which seems to say the Liberals have somehow done a good thing with health care .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Health .
Mr. Randy White
hon. Anne McLellan
Mr. Amerasinghe said in relation to Ted Thompson ' s motives and the real reason for approaching his friend was not to discuss general administrative matters but to alert his close personal friend of the proposed supreme court reference which would embarrass Chief Justice Isaac who had been working to improve the reputation of the federal court .
