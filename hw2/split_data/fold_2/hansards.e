clearly , the aim is political visibility rather than efficiency for the public .
we invested in areas where there was growth .
it stretches from Val d ' Or , the mining sector , to the Raglan sector in the east .
i have proof here that senior department bureaucrats have unethically opened her personal , confidential files in an attempt to smear her just hours after her public disclosure .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
paired
it is important to understand that those roots exist and also to utilize them .
Mr. Mauril B 茅 langer ( Ottawa - Vanier , Lib . ) :
we will follow the advice of Mr. Roy Romanow who spoke in front of the Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce .
what else did we do ?
what has he found about his officials ?
they have been enrolled in the cause of interests that have no particular concern for citizen ' s welfare .
i am proud of a government that recognizes this is how the economy is evolving .
these actions and positions are a matter of record , just the fiscal turnaround we have worked so hard to put in place .
national UNITY
Mr. Philip Mayfield ( Cariboo - Chilcotin , Ref. ) :
in 1994 we announced that we would put in an additional $ 2.5 billion over five years into Canadian student loans .
that is what the federal government will do .
if there was not a special joint committee with members from both the House of Commons and the Senate , then the alternative would likely be that both chambers would hold committee meetings on their own .
when I was growing up , I was taught in school that I was a French Canadian .
my parents are seniors and they are always happy , so obviously they do not need any books .
the federal government is more than happy to provide bonuses of $ 12 million to its top bureaucrats .
this being the day on which Parliament was convoked by proclamation of His Excellency the Governor General of Canada for the dispatch of business , and the members of the House being assembled :
why is he not asking his party to support Quebec ?
the hon. member for Wild Rose claimed that as their financial advisor he was entitled to the same information as the band members themselves .
it is therefore not surprising that Quebec is the most bilingual province in Canada , with 35 percent of the population speaking both English and French .
* * *
the Speaker :
members will have the chance to see how it can be done at the federal level when I reintroduce my private member ' s bill on initiative and referendum hopefully next week .
in recent years the number of applications for CPP disability benefits have increased dramatically , thereby necessitating that these payments be paid in a timely fashion .
perhaps this explains why we in Canada have over twice the unemployment rate of the U.S. We have a significantly higher unemployment rate than that of the U . K . We have three times the unemployment rate of Japan .
i will do whatever I can to push that idea .
therefore people can ask in which direction it is going to look .
now he is back there saying to the people , because he may be coming up for a byelection soon , that they will re - think the HST .

why does the Liberal government condone the CRTC violating its guidelines ?
this is my first opportunity to reply .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
it will eliminate the deficit in 1998 - 99 .
he says the reason it should have a preamble is so the courts will know how to interpret the legislation .
public acceptance for what the courts give is at an all time low .
it continues the important work of prudent financial management while , at the same time , directing resources to strengthen the social and economic fabric of this great country .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 213 , an act respecting the designation of a Louis Riel Day and revoking his conviction of August 1 , 1885 .
hon. Don Boudria
does the hon. member have permission of the House ?
when the UN names Canada as the best country in the world to live in , it is partly because our seniors now live much longer lives , and are more comfortable financially .
why will the finance minister not admit that he is ramming through this tax to avoid the stink of this bad deal sticking to his own political ambitions ?
agreed to and so ordered .
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) :
it is only after writing to Commissioner Murray , on March 5 , that later in the evening I informed my colleagues of the decision and action I had taken , so they would be aware that some allegations affecting organizations for which they were also responsible were circulating .
Mr. Peter Stoffer
* * *
the polling booths are now open .
the Quebec we dream of and want to build will be inclusive and will include the people of all nations and all the immigrants who come here in search of freedom .
to say that we are angry is a simplification .
that was the fault of the government of the day .
i look forward to working with all members of this House and I look forward to working with local communities all over this country to ensure that we have in place the strategies and policies to help Canadians feel safer in their local communities .
[ editor ' s Note :
this government keeps promising jobs for all Canadians , but its proposed changes to the CPP ' s financial provisions mean more power for the big wigs and more hardship for ordinary people .
few Canadians even met others more than 50 miles away .
the House will continue debate on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne today , tomorrow and Monday .
it is not very good question for people who do not have means .
i represent a large number of senior citizens and am proud that now I may serve these people who have spent a lifetime building this great nation .
may I ask the government House leader if he is going to include the other two immediately ?
i can tell both members have great futures ahead of them in this House .
in today ' s society where most families have both spouses out working , it is more and more difficult for families to contribute to the home care of their loved ones .
it is simply scandalous that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans would stand here and tell us that is what he did .
that is the true test and will be the true test of this Parliament .
i want to very briefly comment on the very fiery speech given by the hon. member for Crowfoot .
reform is pushing for improved democracy
say that outside .
our colleague has just referred to the great difficulties now faced by the near - majority of Canadian families , whose children go to school without breakfast .
this place is a disgrace because of those people across the way .
we focus on economic development .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
when CPP was introduced in 1966 it was financed essentially on a pay as you go basis .
i invite him to do so and he may continue his answer .
i would like to outline the approach of the official opposition to this amendment .
i ask the government what specific actions it will take to ensure this will not happen again .
presence IN GALLERY
Mr. Speaker , on September 2 the Ontario advisory committee on housing reform reported to the minister of housing in Ontario .
and we all grieved .
however , we know what the fate of the resolution will be because the government has said that it intends to pass this resolution .
there is a third test which must be applied to any proposed constitutional amendment and that is the test of the Canadian national interest .
that says to me this government is on the wrong track , that the majority of Canadians recognize the huge threat to the Canadian economy , indeed to the security of all Canadians , that $ 600 billion of debt represents .
then the increase in premiums could be significantly lower .
another concern we have as New Democrats is that changing the way the fund is invested from providing funds to provinces into an investment fund will have an impact on some of the poorer provinces of the country .
with a common sense of purpose we as legislators can begin the process of paying off the national debt while making strategic investments in our children and our youth , our health , our communities and our knowledge and creativity .
why would the minister allow politics and profits to take precedence over public safety ?
Mr. Speaker , I too share the frustration of the hon. member who just commented .
what I would like -
hon. Paul Martin
he served his province and his region , especially as an advocate of free trade and private enterprise .
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) :
i would like to point out that in 1982 there was not all this nitpicking about a referendum .
Mr. Speaker , in 1995 , 70 percent of the top contractors with CIDA made significant donations to the Liberal Party of Canada .
it was afraid that the truth would be revealed and Canadians would realize that with the new seniors benefit , single seniors with an income exceeding $ 31,000 would be disadvantaged , as would couples with a combined income of $ 26,000 .
our plan is a balanced plan .
is that really what we want to do ?
while a Reform government would devolve many powers to the provinces where they can be administered better by either the provinces or the municipalities , this is one area in which the federal government has to show strong leadership , and it is not currently doing so .
Mr. Peter MacKay
the theme of partnership permeated the Speech from the Throne ; partnership between governments , provincial , territorial and federal ; partnership between the public and private sector , large corporations , small businesses , communities and individuals ; partnerships which will provide a well - rounded , multifaceted approach to program development and delivery .
those parliaments did great things .
edited HANSARD * NUMBER 8
government can help small business by encouraging banks , including the Business Development Bank of Canada , to lend money to these entrepreneurs .
there must be some goodness left in this government .
we have been debating the Reform motion which refers to the returning to the last 27 years of our history .
when we look at the CTV - Maclean ' s poll , farmers are in the most honourable profession in Canada .
the Presiding Officer , having vacated the chair , and the mace having been laid under the table , conducted Mr. Parent from his seat in the House to the chair .
longer term marketing relationships are to the benefit of farmers and all of Canada .
the hon. members across the floor have frequently accused us of not going to the people with a book full of promises and undertakings to cure all the ills of Canada .
the time is long overdue to move away from protectionist policies and toward those that allow Canadian products to compete in the global market .
more important , this is against an amendment proposed by a member of the House and in favour of the version proposed by the other place .
access TO INFORMATION ACT
i now recognize the hon. member for Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac .
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
how big of a government do we really want ?
nothing in any such Law shall prejudicially affect any Right or Privilege with respect to Denominational Schools which any Class of Persons have by Law in the Province at the Union .
we all know that .
what they have presented so far , their super RRSP would bring in a rate of 13 percent , roughly 4 percent and 5 percent higher than the premiums that we have agreed to with the provinces , including I might point out the province of Alberta .
what exemptions is the government seeking ?
i want to wish Sharon a lot of strength and good luck .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
we cannot just wait for it to happen or it will be a disaster for pensioners .
it cut $ 4 billion from medicare , ending important community programs .
Mr. Speaker , we have been informed that there are allegations to the effect that two persons were carrying Canadian passports in this situation .
i have to concede , hesitantly , that they have made some progress .
the hon. member should know that French Canadians deserve praise for their efforts and that they did not wait for the Bloc Quebecois and its paternalistic statements to fight for their identity .
the government commitment to keeping the country united was quite clear in the throne speech .
we were told in no uncertain terms to keep the CPP .
there is a need to multilateralize .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
motion agreed to
maybe I cannot use that word in the House , but I know the words people on Main Street use to describe the MP pension plan .
Mr. Ted White
earlier I mentioned British Columbians ' under - representation in the Senate .
the Government of Chile did it .
second , it will give some acknowledgement to the long suffering taxpayer .
debate .
another area which was brought to our attention by industry people is the contingency fund .
i spent some time on the government operations committee when we scrutinized a number of departments and found a number of flaws .

motion for concurrence
Mr. Speaker , I want to assure the hon. member and the House that Revenue Canada staff provides no preferential treatment to Federal Express over any other carrier involved in the departmental courier program .
madam Speaker , I would like to congratulate you on your elevation to your new position .
we now have a premier who is unelected , Mr. Russell MacLellan .
if someone is lifted from a social program , becomes a taxpayer and is given the opportunity to make decisions , it will help their fellow Canadian .
the present government supports this policy .
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the justice minister .
i would like to submit to you , Mr. Speaker , that the minister should be required through you to table the letter that he quoted from and referred to .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
at committee we have to come up with some amendments that will try to make this bill more progressive , that will lessen the burden for young people , lessen the burden for low income people and reinstate the death benefit and the disability benefit to where they are presently in the Canada pension plan .
mention has been made of the high honour the House gave to Mr. Knowles by making him an honorary officer and giving him a seat at the table .
then of course Videon made this $ 5,000 donation to the Liberal Party when it never had done so before .
all MPs on all sides of the House share this responsibility .
but I will not be faulted for preferring to be a Quebecer to being a French Canadian .
some issues are reviewing survivor benefits to make sure they reflect changing realities in the needs of today ' s families and considering the mandatory splitting of pension credits between spouses during marriage .
Mr. Speaker , first I want to congratulate my dear friend and colleague from Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot on his election .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
however , the minister will realize that I was responding to a question from the Leader of the Opposition .
the time has come to reawaken Canadians to our history , to remind them of our roots and to acknowledge the contribution of men and women across this country , men like Sir John A . Macdonald and Sir Wilfrid Laurier .
youth cannot get enough money for education .
it reflects what Canadians across the country continue to support .
it is an interesting House in which to sit and listen to these people talking about democracy , accountability and equality .
as part of this national agenda , the federal government will undertake three new initiatives :
Mr. Greg Thompson
thank you , Mr. Speaker , for recognizing me immediately after my distinguished Liberal colleague from the beautiful riding of Stoney Creek finished his speech .
the Speaker :
to show the total disrespect for democracy , we now have closure being used on this bill that affects almost all Canadians .
Ms. Marlene Catterall :
the Chair always takes any matter concerning the privileges of members , particularly any matter that may constitute a contempt of Parliament , very seriously .
nowhere is this better displayed than in the Liberals ' mismanagement of the Pacific salmon dispute over the past four years .
Mr. Cochrane developed a plan to increase subscriptions and attract additional advertisers as well as a new and more aggressive marketing strategy .
so it is a concept that is worth imitating .
Mr. Eug 猫 ne Bellemare
so , if a nitwit is appointed , board directors will have the power to decide that this person ' s salary will be one dollar per year .
canada PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT
i hope it would be to critique insightfully and sensitively a document such as the Speech from the Throne and say " Here are the initiatives we think are pretty sound .
i would like to continue on that point which he opened the door for and reiterate very firmly so all Canadians understand , that we will have a fund .
Mr. John Reynolds
the government will have its position , as reflected in the legislation .
Dartmouth is a community of 70,000 - plus souls on the Atlantic coast , which is now part of a larger amalgamated region including Halifax , Bedford , Sackville and surrounding regions .
i want to repeat that it is important that Canadian who want to speak out on this issue , those who want to make representation , have an opportunity to appear before the joint committee between now and the end of November .
it was gone .
this enactment amends the Criminal Code and provides that a person is guilty of an indictable offence and must be sentenced to one year imprisonment if the person operates or uses a motor vehicle that the person has stolen or knows has been stolen while committing or attempting to commit an offence or during flight after committing or attempting to commit an offence .
parliament OF CANADA ACT
it is what Canadians asked for and it is what we will do .
Mr. Speaker , good afternoon .
our work in this place over the next four years will be difficult .
we really should .
it does not pertain to the administrative responsibilities of the government .
the Deputy Speaker :
we are not prepared to nor do we accept that proposition by the opposition .
main ESTIMATES , 1997 - 98
better pensions at lower cost seem to make too much sense for the Liberals opposite .
we believe very much in investing in Canada ' s human capital .
hon. members across the way have , in fact , tried two methods , each one as unsuccessful as the previous .
i believe we should start with the GST , reduce it .
the rules say the hon. member cannot read the petition .
there will be no dilatory motions subsequently .
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I want to thank the member for his question .
the reply from the minister of foreign affairs came a couple of days later because of the religious situation in that country .
Mr. Speaker , you can also be sure that I will be raising , as much as possible , issues pertaining to health care .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
order , please .
once it gets here I am sure the Essex County lobby and others can make sure that the request gets the significant attention it deserves .
part of what we have been doing over the last 10 years in trying to emphasize and push Canadian governments into getting our economic affairs under some sort of rational control is targeted to sustain the social security we have enjoyed in the past and enjoy now .
similarly , Canada touches my heart and affects my thoughts as I discover the grandeur of our history .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
she said that I was acting on behalf of these people from the Stony reserve as a financial adviser .
miss Deborah Grey
the premier of Newfoundland has stated that his consultation on the Calgary declaration would be done via the Internet , a 1 - 800 line , or at riding meetings .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
i will cite a couple of examples .
* * *
canada PENSION PLAN
i hope my speech gives the Liberals something to think about .
as well , building up large reserves in a world of real low interest rates would not have been much help .
every day , Quebeckers tell me how satisfied they are with the progress made in renewing Canada ' s social union , of which a few of the main characteristics were mentioned earlier .
it cannot be said that CPP premium increases are a tax increase when Tories do it but not when Liberals do it .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
this is done for national security reasons or in an emergency .
i congratulate the Right Hon. Prime Minister .
the prime minister has already committed the government as surpluses become available to investing one - half of any future surplus in social programs where need can be shown , and health will be among the first priorities for that spending .
that is exactly what we intend to do day in and day out in this Chamber .
i would like to ask him whether he realizes that about $ 2 billion crosses the border into the United States every year with wealthy Canadians who buy medical services in the United States .
here is my question :
this may well not be the government ' s intention , but we must point out that it is unacceptable that those waiting for disability benefits must wait up to four years for a settlement .
trying to keep illegal firearms out of this country is going to be a huge problem when we have municipal police officers trying to do the specialized job of policing ports .
one might think that the leader of Quebec ' s separatists , who never misses an opportunity to do battle on the linguistic front , has two different personalities : one international and one local .
on behalf of my family and the official opposition I wish his family well and thank them for the public service they and their family shared through Claude Ellis .
these people are mostly involved in the movement of goods , services or capital .
survivor benefits .
i listened with great interest to the points made by the previous speaker from the Bloc .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
it is not their fault if lobster catches are down .
points OF ORDER
dissenting voices have the right to make themselves heard .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy :
i have talked with the premiers and they are doing , in a very different way , the way they want , their own consultations before they vote on the issue .
what help do we need from the federal government to ensure that we have job creation in business ?
we like to see the young given a fair start .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Public Works .
the motion of the Reform Party talks about irresponsible spending as though we all know what it is .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
frustrated with the Harris government smokescreen , my constituents demand an independent public inquiry to clear the smoke and to produce recommendations which might prevent an environmental tragedy like the Plastimet fire from ever happening again .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
this vast and untouched area has great potential for a natural resource based economy .
once again , concern about saving money took precedence over common sense , and government assistance was cut by $ 7 billion over four years with the results that we know .
if you come to my home and to my family and ask me for some money to examine major league baseball in Detroit , I would not give it to you .
the hon. solicitor general .
further to this , it is my belief that government does not create jobs , the private sector does .
the Liberal government has betrayed the people of British Columbia by time and again standing with the United States instead of with the province of British Columbia .
happily this is not so with the Quebec pension plan .
the people judge us based on our performance , results , programs , etc. I bring back that word today in response to the question , unaccountable .
however , those who can give the most intelligent opinion , the one most closely reflecting day to day reality , are the people who are 65 or 70 years old today and are living with the current program , those who receive the guaranteed income supplement , who can tell us how it would be if they had to live from day to day on an income that came solely from the new form of allowance the Government of Canada is proposing , and can tell us there would be major problems .
when the day was done and they had finished their work , they wanted to drive those same trucks into Dawson Creek , which was the nearest community , to stay in the hotels there overnight and eat in the restaurants .
they also believe the more people that are involved , the better it is .
environment
it is our responsibility .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i await my hon. colleague ' s comments .
that is the pressure from the economic right and the strategies it employs to undermine our ability as parliamentarians to represent fairly the needs of people .
it is not surprising to hear the NDP say that it is opposed to our motion today , considering that it was part of the coalition that started this whole spiral back in the late sixties to begin with .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
the next issue implicit in the government ' s decision not to consult people is its belief that the money from the Canadian public actually belongs to the Liberal Party .
i was called outside the door and given notice that he was on his way downstairs to give notice to the House .
he is no doubt as perplexed as I am with the Liberals ' about - face on this matter .
hear , hear .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅
if I can briefly survey what we have found over the last number of years it can be summed up in three positions .
the article goes on to state :
these two sets of initiatives are indicative of a commitment to children and an approach to children ' s issues which is comprehensive and structured .
when $ 700 - plus is taken for every employee in a firm , that takes a lot of money from that firm .
we have the money to give huge tax breaks to profitable banks and corporations .
the Speaker
this strategy builds on an investment of approximately $ 2 billion in Government of Canada programs for young people .
i suggest that the people of Canada recognized and rewarded the Liberal plan of achieving a balanced budget before considering irresponsible tax cuts that could risk increasing the deficit and the debt .
Mr. Speaker , since we have taken office we have already put a million Canadians back into the workforce .
at the same time as we have this problem going on , we are going through a process of studying our immigration laws that satiate some of the demand of high tech companies in Canada .
was the obscene amount of money spent on keeping a poorly thought out campaign promise worth it ?
house OF COMMONS
i am honoured to be able to pay tribute to the extraordinary efforts of the thousands of courageous and determined men and women volunteers and Canadian military personnel who fought the Saguenay floods in Quebec and the Red River floods in Manitoba .
if members do not believe me they can ask the banks .
access to information documents reveal that on April 18 , 1997 the industry minister and industry department officials were in possession of draft copies of the fifth report of the Standing Committee on Industry .
health and Drug Act
this area is a priority for me .
no less an authority than the former premier of Nova Scotia in his speech to the Empire Club last winter said that 16 percent of all federal spending cuts had fallen on Nova Scotia , a province with about 3 percent of the country ' s population .
money is no problem .
i certainly applaud the intervention of the Progressive Conservative member .
i bring these experiences to my new role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada .
it is these same people , including members of the Bloc Quebecois , who criticized the government ' s spending .
i have not checked with my colleagues but I suspect I could get unanimous approval .
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain :
we feel many of these things have to be done through the criminal courts , not the civil courts .
Mr. Paul Szabo
* * *
we have any number of programs that are there to ensure that young Canadians who graduate from any number of disciplines can have internships that will permit them to hold and refine the skills they have polished over the years .
it is not news to members , certainly on this side of the House , of the wisdom that was shown by the hon. Minister of Finance in providing a new regime that will ensure sustainability of the pension system .
during the 35 th Parliament , the government demonstrated that culture was not one of its major concerns .
it is an important question which has been raised .
sitting Resumed
who knows in 20 years what the premium levels or what the benefit levels will be .
Mr. Peter Adams
Mr. Speaker , I would like to question the member about one thing in his speech .
we need real leaders who can look beyond today and inspire us with a vision of substance of a better Canada , with hope and real belief that we can do so much better than what we have politically .
legion members across this land take up the torch daily to enhance the lives of seniors , youth , veterans and the disabled .
it seems to me that is ignoring the democratic rights of the people of Quebec .
a federation is not static , but rather constantly changing .
the debate concerns obviously Quebec ' s ability to withdraw from the effect of section 93 , especially subsections 1 to 4 .
that is why the House must reject this motion and the philosophy that it represents .
i do not think that what we are doing here is extraordinary .
we are there to help them .
the Canadian public pension system is a crucial part of the Canadian social security net .
it began under the Tories and has been continued by the Liberals .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie
Mr. Peter MacKay
in raising this point I am not trying to be obstructionist in any way .
governments can better increase the profitability of businesses by reducing their costs , rather than by subsidizing certain activities .
in my riding almost everything we produce in a basic industry line is exported and is vitally important .
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua
could the solicitor general indicate how many times CSIS has wiretapped individuals in the past without seeking proper judicial authority ?
in the speech from the throne there is virtually little or nothing on the subject of how to fix the problem of the debt and how to fix the problem of excessive taxation and how to ensure that future spending will not get out of control the way it did in the past .
why are we changing it to unique character from distinct society if both mean the same thing ?
madam Speaker , I wish to advise the House that I have written to the Speaker this morning seeking leave of the House to introduce a motion in accordance with Standing Order 52 , for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter requiring urgent consideration .
that is the second benchmark .
Mr. Speaker , I ask that all Notices of Motions for the Production of Papers be allowed to stand .
then there is the Canadian information system .
if I may , I would also like to thank the active Liberal party members in my riding , and the party executive , for their warm support of my nomination as a candidate .
what about the Canadian public not all of whom have the sophistication of the investors sitting opposite ?
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
will this government stop stealing money from the unemployed by using the surplus in the employment insurance fund to reduce the deficit ?
Mr. Preston Manning
let young people set up a private plan .
canada is recognized world wide as the world capital for money laundering .
in my riding in New Brunswick I have seen what the EI reform did to the citizens there .
i want to provide some evidence with respect to what I say on he who pays the piper calls the tune .
greater capitalization of the CPP will result in significant growth of the assets from approximately two years of benefits to four or five years of benefits over the next twenty years .
Mr. Yvon Godin
those who are from Quebec will know that , in Montreal , the Taverne Magnan is almost like the agora , except that alcoholic beverages are served .
if the hon. member has listened well , what I said was that we must work together for a federation that will be more modern and more democratic , and will include all Canadians from the Atlantic to the Pacific .
what we are asking this government to do is to make decisions that go along with the wishes expressed by the local or regional stakeholders and to stop playing party politics with these issues .
there are two things in particular that have been done .
i may remind the hon. member that the province that benefits the most per capita from the Canada Social Transfer happens to be Quebec .
first of all , since Liberal members were involved , he should have been on his guard .
we already have a tremendous example of consultation .
bill C - 201 .
this is why the Liberal government introduced public health care 30 years ago and that is why the Liberal government will secure it for another 30 years and beyond .
these people are asking for help through demonstrations and other measures and they are getting no answers .
i am therefore inviting the minister to sit down with the Government of Quebec to find the best way to get the most out of these funds while respecting the respective governmental jurisdictions .
i would like to bring them back to earth to tell them that France ' s Prime Minister , Lionel Jospin , confirmed that , in the very unlikely event of a yes vote in a hypothetical referendum in Quebec , France would have to assess Quebeckers ' decision , as well as Canada ' s assessment of it , before taking a decision .
Mr. Speaker , the recent announcement in Oslo , Norway that nearly 90 countries had agreed on a treaty that would ban anti - personnel landmines is a tremendous achievement for Canadian diplomacy .
in fact the Financial Post indicated that current pensioners are getting about $ 7 out for every $ 1 in .
Mr. Norman Doyle
the government is now suggesting that the human resources development minister is some kind of a boy scout because he called the police on this fund - raising extortion scandal .
to come back to the issue at hand , Madam Speaker , even the director of the employment centre deplores the minister ' s decision .
i am referring to Brian Mulroney , who was the member for Charlevoix and Prime Minister of Canada .
the ruse he found to lull some Atlantic provinces was the harmonization that Quebec had already carried out in 1991 - 92 and that should bring in to Quebec about as much as was offered to the three provinces that agreed to harmonize their taxes .
we need policies that support parents as they raise their children not which put them at a disadvantage .
impaired Driving
we can do three things .
section 5.5 says that decisions of the management committee will be in writing and will be acted on only if they are unanimous .
this pressure on the essence of government is also explained appropriately by John Ralson Saul in his book The Unconscious Civilization :
an hon. member :
the member talked about not reinforcing those heritages .
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅
we in the Bloc Quebecois , we Quebeckers , know what we want and where we are going .
when a society reaches a clear consensus regarding the administrative structures required to educate its children , it is then up to the government to react .
as a government we must strike a balance between the present and the future .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed . )
the other point is that the member for Calgary Southwest probably meant we should be seeking more accountability from government machinery .
until now CPP contributions not needed to pay for benefits have been lent mainly to the provinces at the federal government ' s interest rate on long term bonds .
government BILLS INTRODUCED IN SENATE
Canadians from every part of the country responded generously to appeals for assistance .
no formal complaint has been filed .
speech FROM THE THRONE
this 9.9 percent rate is also substantially lower than the Reform Party proposal to replace the CPP by a system of mandatory RRSPs .
from time to time I hear the criticism that this speech contains nothing new , nothing dramatic , that it is a rehash .
i did not know that was the policy of the Reform Party , to increase Canada pension plan benefits .
the Minister of Finance has completed the first task .
in reality it should have been looking at it more pessimistically given the input it got from its own financial actuaries who said that under the Canada pension plan structure it was doomed to failure by the end of this century .
a vast majority of western Canadian grain farmers whom the bill will affect and I hoped the minister and his government would have listened to them .
i replied in advance , with reference to the people that make up Canada , of course , that this included the people to which we belong in Quebec , and as French Canadians as well .
benefits are withdrawn if they work for over three months .
now it is devolving it to the municipalities .
the Speech from the Throne does chart a course for entering the 21 st century .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
he was right .
the panel hearings were far from efficient , drawn out over a period of three years .
Canadians want smaller government .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
similarly , it is presumably acceptable to use section 43 to remove any such special restrictions .
why did this happen and why did he feel it was necessary to bring it to the attention of those two particular ministers ?
the Minister of Finance in his last budget reminded us that a government relieved of its deficit burden is not a government relieved of its obligations .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
when the time comes for them to determine their future , they will realize there is no risk involved in having one own ' s country and being sovereign , in exchanging the maple leaf for a fleur de lys , since all the money will stay in Quebec and be used to meet their own needs .
i do not wish to interrupt the hon. member but he must address his remarks to the Chair .
i would ask the hon. member to -
Tuesday , September 30 , 1997
we should be acting now to turn the CPP into something worth having instead of leaving it as a massive tax grab which promises only poverty after 35 years of payments .
it will be more difficult for some people who now qualify and will not qualify under changes to the legislation .
statements BY MEMBERS
as their member I vow to work with my colleagues and in partnership with the private and non - profit sectors to address the challenges which we face today and in the future .
i listened closely to his speech and I feel he will make a good MP - or at least I hope so .
some hon. members :
as members of Parliament , we have a duty to monitor legislation , and this one in particular .
my constituents have indicated to me that we must start by solving problems , and must treat all citizens of this marvellous country on an equal footing .
i am especially pleased to have been reappointed international trade critic because it is critical to Canada .
as a founding member of the Women Entrepreneurs of Canada , I know first hand about the strength of women - owned businesses .
we will put the debt to GDP ratio on a permanent downward trend .
it was not directed at an individual .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
we are putting in place a plan for the future .
the very first time we put the question to the prime minister he said that Canadians had nothing to do with this mission .
when this Parliament made the mistakes and changed the law , we now have street prostitution from one end of the country to the other .
Mr. David Iftody
madam Speaker , I found it rather unusual that in the member ' s speech she mentioned health care in Ontario , and of how people are sent back home too soon as if it was just happening in Ontario .
however , I would like to ask you to consider joining with me in the days and weeks ahead in the following manner .
but what did the government do for victims , those who have not deliberately decided to offend society ' s rules but just happen to be in the wrong place and the wrong time ?
i come from Alberta .
i notice I have one minute left , Mr. Speaker .
also a very special thanks goes out to our riding president , Ernie Chaplin , for his dedication and continued support .
i think that in relative terms compared to anywhere else in the world , where would the hon. member prefer to live ?
he also referred to two referendums .
bill C - 236 .

presence IN GALLERY
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
when we take the bill to committee we will tinker around to see if we can make it agreeable to everybody .
in my home town of Elliot Lake , starting in 1990 we experienced a job loss of some 5,000 in the uranium mining industry .
Mr. Speaker , I am a little bit curious about the hon. member ' s comments about the referendum section of the amendment proposed yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition .
it has now come up with all the figures for changing the Canada pension plan .
it will be noted that the Quebec assembly goes out of its way to state that its proposed amendment in no way constitutes recognition by the National Assembly of the Constitution Act of 1982 .
many Canadians fail to realize how fortunate we really are in comparison to other countries .
during the national consultations on the CPP , Canadians told their governments to go easy on changes to the benefits .
that is very important if the other spouse stayed at home to manage the family home and care for preschool children and , therefore , does not have a sufficient number of working years .
while he might want to say that I said we were there , he knows full well it is an objective that will be best achieved through the efforts of this government no doubt with the co - operation of the opposition parties .
Robert Bourassa , a Liberal , was not a sovereignist but a federalist , yet he never agreed to sign the Constitution .
instead of moving legislation or proposing a private member ' s bill , what the Reform Party has done is that each one of the class of '97 has written to Treasury Board saying they want to opt out of the MP pension plan .
was she asking for a comment from you ?
the fact that these amendments include the creation of a board to ensure the CPP fund is invested in the most appropriate way for Canadians makes a lot of sense .

this insurance would be expensive .
Mr. Bernard Bigras :

this is why a great deal of care has been given to the vital matter of fund governance in the drafting of this bill .
i am from Ontario and I have never in my life stood up here and talked about the fact that Ontario feels gypped by Confederation .
i want to tell you that in the previous years , I was travelling with the Quebec government , the Liberal government in Quebec , aboard its F - 27 .

we took the challenge of dealing aggressively with the deficit and we met it .
every woman who died this year was someone ' s wife , mother , daughter , sister , grandmother , aunt or cousin .
on this occasion I would like to wish him and his family well .
madam Speaker , the member for Bourassa shows how narrow - minded he can be .

Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) :
this report went beyond the Prime Minister ' s expectations , and here he is ready to spread his tentacles further out into this area of provincial jurisdiction .
this legislation will allow that to happen .
as you know , Quebecers have long debated the two roads , and continue to do so .
that is about 33 cents of interest charges for every dollar in revenue raised by government .

in 1994 the deputy prime minister and former environment minister committed to further cut CO 2 emissions by 20 per cent .
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅
DND knows very well it is impossible to integrate women fully by 1999 . All I have to say to that is : too little too late .
i listened with interest to her comments on the reform of the Senate .
canada is well - positioned to be a world leader in the global knowledge - based economy of the 21 st century .
we must continue to work at it in this mandate .
as many as 11,000 jobs in Canada are supported by every billion dollars in existing exports .
petitions
the debate to which the hon. member refers is a discussion over the natural rate of unemployment , the rate at which inflation would take off , and there is , in fact , a difference of opinion .

hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
the Speaker :
her riding kept its centre .
we have a duty and an obligation in the House to plan for the next generation .
some hon. members :
all this week the radar technicians have been in Ottawa for what may be their last reunion because many of their operators may be too old to keep it going .
Mr. Speaker , the throne speech neglected to acknowledge and invite municipal governments , the governments closest to the people to help keep Canada together .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :

this was what my constituents had accepted as a very real priority .
Mr. Gary Pillitteri
finally the Speech from the Throne emphasized the leadership role that Canada plays and must continue to play in liberalizing trade around the globe .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
madam Speaker , I was really impressed with the hon. member ' s speech .
the motion goes on to state that the committee is to make its final report no later than November 7 , 1997 .
it is also a reversal of policy for the Reform Party .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
changes have been made to the EI benefits to address seasonal workers , especially in Atlantic Canada and other areas .
the provinces are being treated like so many municipalities .
it is imperative that the government strive for fairness with the pension system .
Mr. Jack Ramsay
the bad news is that Canadians will not see a penny of it .
as we enter the 21 st century the government will begin to reinvest the fiscal dividends that will come from the elimination of the deficit .
yes the Labour Party which took power had to clean up the mess because within a few days of taking power , those investors who had been prepared to buy government bonds deserted en masse .
we are moving out .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
the CEOs of this country are really learning directly from the recent grads .
it is very clear .
and of course , the Canadian Wheat Board directors , as I said , those who were duly elected , would have to agree and farmers would have to approve it by a democratic vote .
another troubling issue is that recipients of CPP disability benefits who try to work are penalized .
this reform of the Canada pension plan is of particular interest to me because I am the Bloc Quebecois critic for seniors and also because it affects me as a member of that generation .
why does this government refuse to reduce job killing payroll taxes such as the surplus that we have in the EI fund ?
it did not even think for a moment about the implication and the threats this placed on Canadian passport holders travelling abroad .
if they do not , then an arbitrator can be imposed on them .
he did not say that .
i appreciate the opportunity to extend my condolences to his widow Bessie and their family .
Mr. Peter Adams
Yes.
since plutonium with its immense radioactive longevity and carcinogenic qualities cannot be disposed of , " disposition " is used to mean moving plutonium from one place to another without actually eliminating its danger .
is the Prime Minister not aware that these elements combined together oblige him to submit the case of his minister -
while these statistics are alarming , we have made great strides in the fight against this disease .
that is only 38 days from now .
if there are questions and comments , I will allow them ; if not , we will move on .

the debt that we inherited in 1993 was what the Reform Party , when it first came into the House , talked about incessantly .

despite general prosperity , many seniors found themselves victims of inflation and of the fact they had not been able to save much during the hard years of depression and war .
just this morning , it was reported in Le Journal de Montr 茅 al , Le Journal de Qu 茅 bec and The Globe and Mail that a poll by L 茅 ger & L 茅 ger indicated that 45 percent of Quebecers said the Calgary proposal was clearly not enough , while another 35 percent could live with it .
hon. Paul Martin :
i think the member should be a great deal more modest in his analysis of the election results .
madam Speaker , would you please remind the hon. member for Abitibi that everything that is being said here is recorded in Hansard .
Mr. Bryon Wilfert
as many of us maintained , the port was not utilized to its fullest for years .
British Columbia is the most under - represented province in both this House and the other place .
the Chair will know that the time allocation motion has to do with the amendments to the Canada pension plan .
as it pertains to political parties , they receive 22.5 % of the reimbursement .
in 1980 , and here I will give a little course in history for those opposite who so quickly forget , the Prime Minister was Pierre Elliott Trudeau .
at issue is the potential loss of some $ 30 million in economic benefits these major cultural and sporting events generate in Quebec , mainly in Montreal .
back then , Quebec did have all these businesses , with important businesses , even in certain cases multinationals , controlled and owned by Quebeckers .
it is robbing from many Canadians the ability to have the kind of standard of living that they legitimately expect .
* * *
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member .
i would also point out that the number one priority for Canadians from the government ' s own survey is the reduction of government spending .
presence IN GALLERY
the Reform motion clearly demonstrates their lack of concrete ideas on the question .
it is no longer possible for an economically viable nation to live in isolation of world affairs and events .
it is this difference of opinion that divides us into five parties and which will lead to spirited debate in this Parliament .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the next week in Courtenay , B.C. a six - year old girl was sexually assaulted and murdered by a sixteen - year old neighbour who was on probation for molesting a young child one year earlier .
in any deal no one expects to get their own financial adviser ' s top dollar .
it would appear from what I have heard that this issue pertains to the Privacy Act more than to the Access to Information Act .
madam Speaker , first I would like to congratulate the hon. member on a heartfelt speech , one that raises some very interesting points about the direction in which our country is going .

would the cost of that insurance put jobs in jeopardy ?
no decision has been made yet .
i would have thought the government would have recognized this deficiency and have begun to address it in the initial throne speech but that was not to be .
this recognition is not simply based on rhetoric .
Mr. Speaker , as I said last Friday , the decision to move flights from Mirabel to Dorval was made by A 茅 roports de Montr 茅al.
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic ) , BQ :
the hon. member for Willowdale who spoke on behalf of the Liberal Party stated that one of the things he was proud of was Canada Council grants provided by the Liberal government .
Mr. Speaker , the first thing I should report to the House is that we contacted the hon. member ' s office for information about all these calls and we have yet to receive any of that information .
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain :
we must not forget our family , whether it is a traditional family , a reconstituted family , an extended family or a single parent family .
Mr. Alex Shepherd
i am saying that if this type of thing is allowed to happen , as we are talking about in question period right now , surely to heaven the member would like to see it cleaned up .
i think my hon. friend misses the point here .
what concerned us most was that Bill C - 72 allowed for the exclusion of grains from the wheat board ' s jurisdiction but made no parallel provisions for grains to be added to that jurisdiction .
Mr. Speaker , we are very concerned about the situation the member describes and I would appreciate it if he listened to the reply , because it is important that he tell his constituents and all those living in his riding what to do .
however , I found the last two or three sentences not only disturbing but literally frightening .
on the issue of reforming the Canada pension plan , there was an accrued liability and we could not afford to continue on a pay as you go basis .
Mr. Peter Goldring :
the hon. member for Simcoe North speaks good French since he is a francophone , but he is also the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs .

Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
hon. Don Boudria
i will be splitting my time with the member for North Vancouver .
the multicultural community can play a very important role in the unity of our country .
if I may , I will quote the President of Treasury Board who , in the March 8 , 1996 edition of Le Soleil , publicly admitted the federal government ' s strategy , a strategy which consisted of dumping its problems of public funding onto the provinces , getting the provinces to do the dirty work , so that it can come out looking good to all of the taxpayers .
one thing I am really getting tired of is hearing all the warm fuzzy talk .
on a personal note may I say that I know the area of the country that the minister comes from and I am sure he will be conscientious of working with all of us .
i want to thank you , Madam Speaker , and again congratulate you on your appointment .
the prime minister has recently appointed the minister of HRD as the lead on the post - TAGS issue .
does the Prime Minister not find it unacceptable , as much for the sake of the Supreme Court ' s credibility as for that of the judicial system , that the members of the highest court in the land are appointed by a single person without any sort of public consultation ?
our young people are the future of this country .
Mr. Speaker , we have always been especially careful when we have had to deal with the contracting process in whatever portfolio I have been responsible for .
they remember what he did for the Legion , for veterans and for his community .
we avoided the increase of 14.2 % that was actually estimated by the chief actuary .

some hon. members :
they voted for kept promises and they voted for a better tomorrow .
Mr. Speaker , I acknowledged the good things in this country .
Mr. Speaker , I do not know whether to laugh or cry this afternoon .
the chief actuary has basically advised Canadians that although we pay at a rate of 5.85 percent , which is split equally between the employer and the employee , this rate will have to increase to 10.1 percent by about the year 2015 , and by 2030 it will have to be raised to 14.2 percent .
finally , part VI of the Canadian Wheat Board Act allows marketing plans for voluntary pools to be established for grains , varieties , grades or classes that are not required to be marketed through the Canadian Wheat Board .
canada pension plan premiums will rise at a faster rate than originally planned .
you look great .
why would we ?
women - owned businesses are a significant sector of our economy .
this afternoon , in this House , the Reform member for Calgary Southwest said that he believed millionaires in this country paid too much in taxes .
i am going to permit the hon. minister to answer the question but the specifics are getting a little bit tight .
Mr. Speaker , I want to convey to you and to this House that it is a great honour to represent Vancouver Kingsway in this Parliament .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
we will know what the rate will be in the future .
this bill is a last ditch resort and is an attempt to ensure that women who continue to take substances that are injurious to their unborn children can be put into a treatment facility against their wishes if necessary .
i have outlined many initiatives pertaining to people , innovators , businesses and communities at work across this country .
some day in the House I would like to discuss in detail the inequality that exists in the country with respect to the exercise of the federal spending and taxing powers .
because of a lack of democracy ?
prior to Tuesday of last week no privileges were claimed .
there were very few changes to be made to this bill as it had been submitted in the last Parliament .
Mrs. Monique Guay
i am happy to be here in the House for the member ' s maiden speech .
i am surprised because we are dealing with a system that connects the federal government to the Liberal Party of Canada as far as financing is concerned .
we want a safety net if disaster befalls us , but believe we could better protect ourselves and our families against that if there was less government meddling in our lives , however well intentioned .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to indicate that I will be sharing our speaking slot with my hon. colleague from Winnipeg North Centre .
my question is a very simple one :
canada is an independent state , recognized as such by the United Nations , and it has the same rights as other countries .
we have dealt with the deficit as we have said we would .
the Churchill riding is home to a number of communities where seasonal work is the only way of life .
over the course of the last several years we have moved on at least 60 different cases of eliminating overlap and duplication in mining regulations .
i am aware of the significance of what I am asking you to do .
he might want to address that in a question during question period to the Minister of Health .
however , to succeed in today ' s economy young people need more education , better skills and relevant experience .
the Speaker :
both those reasons are for safety .
Mrs. Sharon Hayes
oh , oh .
corporations have had to cut costs .
i am also familiar with a small , family owned restaurant whose owners find themselves unable to hire the staff they need because payroll taxes are too high .
the Speech from the Throne was the opportunity for the government to say to Canadians what it is about this new century , this new era that it cares about , that it wants to focus on .
the constitutional amendment tabled by the minister takes account of that evolution .
i could spend the rest of the day talking about our many contributions and how proud I am to be a part of Simcoe - Grey riding but time does not permit it .
the Speaker :
the end of the 20 th century as an era of historical transition has seen a remarkable convergence of two contradictory historical forces : the movement toward supranationalism and political and sometimes economic integration on a regional or at least transnational basis and the revival of local nationalism and ethnocultural particularism sometimes on a pathological basis that finds its outlet in internecine conflict within the one state .
like any parent , father or mother , perhaps there is a need for insurance that the future for our children will continue to advance .
i heard from the seniors .
simply reporting it is not enough .
unless I am mistaken - and I have not had a lot of time to examine precedents , as you will agree , Mr. Speaker - I have not found it in Beauchesne ' s .
it goes without saying that you would never accept that third party to be someone appointed and paid by your neighbour .
i oppose that and our party opposes that .

Mr. Peter Stoffer
Mr. David Pratt ( Nepean - Carleton , Lib . ) :
in an economy based on knowledge and innovation , many Canadians see outlets for their ideas and new horizons for their children .
Mr. Jean Dub 茅 ( Madawaska - Restigouche , PC ) :
we on the other hand choose to speak about priorities .
if there is time available between the tax treaty bill and the customs tariff bill , after completing the latter we will consider Bill C - 5 , the co - operatives legislation , second reading of Bill C - 8 , respecting the Yukon , and second reading of Bill C - 6 , respecting the Mackenzie valley .
this is particularly true for rural Canada .
there will only be one vote per producer .
i wish he would explain it to me .
it never had any surplus in the unemployment insurance fund .
Mr. Speaker , for the past two years , private and foreign investment in Quebec has reached record proportions , in spite of the constitutional debate .
agreed .
we believe and it is legally enshrined in law in this country that the family is an economic unit .
ASIA CONNECTS YOUTH CONFERENCE
the House met at 10 a.m.
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
when we came to power , the rates of contribution were going up , year after year .
Mr. Art Hanger
that is how ridiculous this bill is .
cuts to the last post fund have made it more difficult than some of the other cuts because it costs a lot more today to bury a veteran than it did 10 years ago .

pacific SALMON FISHERY
Mr. Grant Hill
we do believe this message has been heard in Israel .
even if the sovereignists lost the battle by 50,000 votes , we are a democracy , and the Government of Quebec is democratic .
the purpose of this bill is to include the terms " nutrition services " in the definition of " insured health services " within the present Canada Health Act .
is the Prime Minister now telling us that once again he is going to change his story and not fulfil the commitment he made to the voters of Quebec ?
if people become disabled they would have to make use of his benefits earlier than anticipated .
year after year , the squandering of billions and billions of dollars by the federal administration is denounced in the auditor general ' s reports .
the minister ' s response was no .
the people of Voisey ' s Bay are saying that .
the bottom line is that they could all get those jobs twice over .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
what numbers are available ?
Mr. Speaker , I wish to inform the House and all Canadians that October is breast cancer awareness month .
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
the national child benefit system will provide more support to low income families struggling to provide their children with a good start in life .
recently we have seen a slight evolution of the federalist approach to the issue of Quebec ' s secession .
as we move forward into the next millennium , changes will continue to take place in our economy .
Mr. John Finlay
that is the position of the government to this point .
Mr. Speaker , as a physician , I am pleased to mark the 130 th anniversary of the Canadian Medical Association , or CMA .
hon. David Kilgour
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
provincial governments that have made the hard decisions know differently .
would that be acceptable to you ?
a bunch of the good old boys , like Turbot Tobin and Walleye Woodward , were out with their chum the Federal Fisherman .
fairness and equity are important issues and important challenges .
the commitment to invest 50 percent of the budgetary process to these social and economic initiatives shows the government ' s willingness to practise fiscal responsibility while it addresses these pressing problems .
the surplus is there because those people are not paid unemployment insurance premiums the same way they would have been prior to this government .
we share the member ' s concern .
Canadians must know that they can count on their health care system .
however we have never lost sight of the companion obligation to use the resources that we do have in intelligent and effective ways to strengthen our society and advance our economy .
i know that is a new idea on the government benches , but it is one that is critically important to the young Canadians who are with us today .
it is outrageous and unacceptable that this has happened within the highest levels of the justice department .
i have yet to find a single Canadian who says they are not prepared to provide more premiums if they are guaranteed a pension when they retire .
the reverse would have been surprising .
i have to disclose that Reform members were not there to listen to Canadians .
my hon. colleague from North Vancouver alluded to a survey in the Financial Post .
it is a great honour to be able to represent them again here in the House of Commons .
on behalf of the Government of Canada I would like to extend deepest sympathies and condolences to the family , the children and grandchildren of Stanley Knowles .
this bill would allow spouses to split up to $ 25,000 of income between them so that one could stay at home and care for preschool children .
central Canada was largely strengthened when tariff barriers went up and the regions paid a huge price .
let us commit to working toward , not simply planning for , the new millennium .
imagine , $ 500 million for something which initially was supposed to cost $ 260 million .

we are well educated .
i can only go on record and say in this Chamber what I have said publicly , that I personally did not support a proposal in the policy platform for a department of sustainable development .
a key aim of this strategy is the immunization of every child and the eradication of polio and measles worldwide .
in my role as the direct democracy critic for Reform I will continue to apply pressure for change in this place , changes which would make it more effective and deliver real value for those who pay our salaries .
they must be responsible if they are responsible for their own pay , benefits and working conditions .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
no actuarially sound insurance plan would have high risk users pay the same or even less than low risk users .
the bottom line for trade should be and must always be people , and their bottom line is jobs .
these are all issues of great concern to Canadians and issues which Reform intend to pursue with vigour in this session of Parliament .
i am pleased to note that the amendments were retained in the new bill .

they should be heard .
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
what we saw on This Hour Has 22 Minutes the other night was bad enough .
it was kind of a rant , I thought .
perhaps you could respond to this in an answer for me .
that is also positive .
by connecting Canadians to each other , to their institutions and governments and to the rest of the world , we will all better understand who we are and Canadians will have the tools they need to maximize their potential .
speech FROM THE THRONE
SAGUENAY AND MANITOBA FLOODS
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the President of the Treasury Board .
it takes the liability away from the government , which is forcing this bill on farmers and placing the liability on producers .
community ACCESS
they will have the capacity to look at equity and in so doing , they will be able to earn a greater return from the pension plan funds that are invested .
this was not something I dreamt up during the campaign .
they only talk about the deficit because they are speeding up at a slower rate .
not more than two days afterward , he said he consulted with the members and Canadians .
shame on the government '' .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
this is another subject to follow .
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate the member for Winnipeg North Centre for her maiden remarks in the House of Commons .
other large corporations in the oil and gas industry are also making tremendous progress in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions .
i would have thought that in all the talk about partnerships in last week ' s throne speech , this is one way to work with the provinces and territories to develop a true national transportation policy .

i believe Canadians appreciate that the many years of sacrifice will pay off in the end , and that end is soon .
we fought and signed the North American free trade agreement .

Mr. Yvon Godin
i cannot say the churches were completely happy with that , but as we say in Newfoundland a half a loaf is better than none .
last summer the Tax Court of Canada struck down a cruel effort by the minister ' s department to impose back payroll taxes on Mrs. Janice Collingridge , a severely disabled , low income , non - verbal quadriplegic .
the minister of fisheries knows perfectly well that Canadians were invited to testify and they failed to testify .
i did not specify that it would be for Quebec alone and that it would not go outside our province .

the police have even raided the Liberal Party headquarters .
rather than feigning indignation , the member for Laval West should be blushing for having enjoyed the pleasures of cronyism .
i would be happy to table them in the House .
the point he was trying to make was that increases to CPP premiums are a tax .
Mr. Philip Mayfield
we said we would and we will .
Mr. Maurice Dumas
i guess it would do very well for all the friends of the Reform Party , their investment brokers and counsellors .
let us examine those .
the Speaker :
both of these parties say that the Calgary declaration is worthless and does not come anywhere close to addressing Quebec ' s grievances .
certainly we welcome any positive conditions that they will introduce to further business in Canada .
i do not think so .
i have made a special commitment to my riding , one that I hope all residents will join me in no matter what their party affiliation .
Mr. Dale Johnston ( Wetaskiwin , Ref. ) :
far more crucial than any notion of equality among the provinces is the fundamental equality of Canadians , Canadians as citizens , equality before the law , equality of services , equality of opportunity .
this is wrong .
her employer let her go because he did not want to have to field phone calls from thugs any longer .
i hope that the member will come around to that way of thinking .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
this is a false story and a cover - up described within Mr. Amerasinghe ' s internal documents to his superiors .
we promised in our election programme that we would help rural Canada share new technologies and we will keep that promise .
some of the information can be provided , however , to individual members of the band , as they are entitled .
can the minister assure this House and the people of Canada that this program will be driven by the local communities as it should be and not by bureaucrats from Ottawa ?
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate the hon. Liberal member for his throne speech .
it is irresponsible for a government to artificially determine optimal government size and taxation levels and then drop the ball in order to achieve those goals .
Mr. Peter Stoffer
we never say that , the day after a yes vote , the first people interested in sitting down with Quebec would be my friends across the way .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i have spoken to many stakeholders across the country and I can say that they have very divergent needs .
Mr. Ted White
it is all so much trickery , like using the five billion dollars - five billion , that is 5,000 million dollars - from the employment insurance fund to reduce the federal deficit .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I understand that I have only a few seconds left .
hon. Jane Stewart
he had more to say outside the House , but what he said was nonetheless interesting .
and all the while , Canadian workers , children and the elderly have been paying the price .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
today , we have learned that in fact the minister spoke to several cabinet colleagues , including ministers from Quebec .
it was a perfect picture .
i want to thank the constituents of Malpeque for having the confidence to re - elect me to this 36 th Parliament .
when he talks about investment does he really mean squandering ?
it takes a profoundly irresponsible government to forget , as the Liberal government is doing , that , while the deficit could apparently be reduced to zero by the year 2000 , this government , this country is still $ 600 billion in debt .
( motion agreed to )
it came about as a result of a lot of hard work .
i have been very vocal and very upset about the issue over the last couple of months .

statements BY MEMBERS
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
the government achieved the first annual surplus since 1982 .
i know that these are issues that many of us deal with in our constituency offices .
the Speaker :
the aim of this amendment was essentially to restructure the school system along linguistic rather than denominational lines .
one of the fundamental functions for which Parliament was created was specifically to constrain arbitrary taxation and actions by the executive .
the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has 30 seconds to respond .
i wonder why he did not run in Yorkton .

saint - R 茅 mi de Lac - aux - Sables is an outdoor tourism centre of great attraction to boaters and sport fishers .
for example , on referral after first reading , we have tried to increase the influence of this place and of ordinary members on legislation in committees and otherwise in an attempt to bring the new political reality we are all talking about to bear on the 1990 s and into the next millennium .
motions FOR PAPERS
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
bill C - 2 also illustrates the government ' s failure to consult with young Canadians and to look after their interests .
those are three key benchmarks that we as a political party certainly believe in as we assess the changes we bring forward for CPP .
Mr. Speaker , the premier of Newfoundland is the one answerable to the voters of Newfoundland , and it is up to him to defend his proposal .
i do not think so .
third the government ' s view that the 77 percent hike in CPP premiums proposed to fund the CPP investment fund is not a tax is flatly contradicted by previously published reports of the government itself , including the finance department and its advisers .
No. Mr. Bouchard , how will you justify to Quebeckers the high cost of your trip to France if you do not talk about their priorities ?
members who sat in this House who were members of that government were under investigation on charges of abusing public funds , the Commonwealth Nanaimo federation .
i certainly respect his Hungarian heritage .
Mr. Derek Lee
- whatever duty a Member has to his constituents , before a valid question of privilege arises in respect to any alleged interference , such interference must relate to the Member ' s parliamentary duties .
we think market forces should determine what grain goes where and when .
as the official critic on seniors issues , I also made the following statement in the House , again in 1994 , and I quote :
the idea of an annual celebration of rural women originated in 1995 during the fourth United Nations conference on women held in Beijing .
i pointed out a number of things a moment ago : the basic difference between a donation and a loan , but also the fact that he said he did not get any contribution from companies whereas the list shows the contrary .
that is not our style and that is why he is on that side .
the Deputy Speaker :
and we know that we can , and must , do even more .
i obviously think not .
the fund will grow in value from about two years of benefits currently to about four to five years of benefits .
my presence here as the member of Parliament for Oxford is an incredible honour for me but it has made my father , who came to this country so many years before with a wife an two young sons in tow , a very proud man .
Mr. Speaker , the Government of Canada has an obligation to protect the good reputation of Canadians overseas .
it is home to the Sayisi and the Northlands Dene nation , a nation that is still disputing land claims north of the 60 th parallel .
give the chief executive officer the opportunity to put his or her positions forward on the basis of the board , not on the basis of politics .
as well , I extend my heartfelt thanks to the constituents of Halifax West who expressed their faith and confidence in me that I will work for and represent them in the House of Commons during this 36 th Parliament .
the Deputy Speaker :
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. minister .
he could choose to support out of control bureaucrats on a witch hunt or he could choose to support the scientist who has allegations of truth .
it is unfortunate the hon. member who spoke before me found it necessary to engage in overblown , overheated partisan demagogic rhetoric .
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
the minister of finance of Ontario , a hero to many Reformers , on February 15 , 1997 stated : " We have protected benefits for pensioners and secured a sound financial future for the plan and the people who need it '' .
a deficit is the amount of money the government blows more of every year over and above the amount of money the government takes in .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
when we landed at the airport it was a red carpet that greeted our arrival .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
this , he argued , constituted a contempt of Parliament .
all Canadians have a stake in meeting that challenge successfully .
throughout that period Bessie and Claude were advisors to me .
we were not against free trade as such , but we felt that the agreement as negotiated needed improvement .
they really set the stage for the total collapse of a welfare state .
only an open judicial inquiry would allow scientists from within the department to state openly their concerns without fear of job retribution .
fire PREVENTION

Mrs. Carolyn Bennett :
Mr. Speaker , it is always a pleasure to sit in the House , listen and learn , and then give the opposition some good advice and perhaps explain a term or two .
i have yet to hear anything too insightful or thoughtful on the part of the Reform on how to address the problems of Atlantic Canadians .
as a result , unlike certain members of the preceding Parliament , he understands that the Bloc Quebecois members who are here today are not an anachronism and are not completely out of touch with Quebec realities .
we have learned that one of the top officials of the Minister of National Revenue is trying to gag Mr. Coffey , threatening him with disciplinary action and making these allegations public before the appeal board .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to be able to speak today in response to the throne speech .
except for their trained seal capacity to vote as told they have all been spewing the same bland stuff that was in that throne speech , and there is nothing there .
the member seems to have his facts in error .
Mr. Yvan Loubier
the Speaker :
with budget surpluses within reach , the Liberal government is wondering if it could not carry on pleasing people , without their noticing what is going on .
there was a reference in our throne speech to bringing down those walls .
because time does not permit I do not want to go into an in depth analysis and talk about how , when the Liberal government took office in 1993 , the unemployment rate was at 11.5 percent and today as we all know it is 9 percent and dropping ; how we inherited a $ 42 billion deficit from a Conservative government that had never met its budget targets ; or how we inherited a country so weakened from all aspects that we were being described as a third world economy .
MACKENZIE VALLEY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT

Mr. Peter Adams
if I understood correctly , our friends in the Bloc Quebecois are going to vote in favour of the Reform Party ' s motion .
perhaps there was a good reason for his return to debate the retirement system of Canada .
it is the key to growth and jobs in years ahead .
Mr. Speaker , the last member gave us a history lesson .
if the government does not believe in that it does not believe in this country .
many of their employees are now on a contract basis to enable them to escape payroll tax .
indeed we want peace , the peace that results from a resolution to the current dilemma that some Quebecois are unconvinced that their future is best realized within the framework of the Canadian Confederation .
it is 17 years since my predecessor rose in this House to give his first address and 36 years since his predecessor ' s .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
i congratulate Dr. Bolton .
the Speaker :
i say back because in 1975 I sat here in the House of Commons as a student participating in a model Parliament in seat 113 .
income TAX ACT
it seems to me that it would be natural to want to know whether he is consulted as part of the overall government procedure , not just that for one department .
that is one of the reasons the amendments before the House are calling for an increase in premiums .
there were two division bells .
in conclusion , Quebec society has succeeded in reaching a consensus on a constitutional issue which touches upon such vital issues for citizens as schooling , language , religion and the Constitution .

third , if the proposed exclusion is significant there must be a vote among producers to approve it .
the SENATE
this bill provides us with the necessary tools to prevent future occurrences of document tampering .

hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
it is also less than what private sector plans earn .
global WARMING
Mr. Paul Mercier
the entire program is aimed at enabling people to come to terms increasingly with the need to prepare for retirement .
reserve FORCE ACT
this makes for a welcome change .
there was a lot of adjustment , but in the long run the changes which took place have shown that Elliot Lake and that region will survive and do very well .
division on motion deferred
it is a good plan .
if the federal government is to exercise its responsibilities in a global and highly competitive world , then certain traditional provincial powers might be better exercised at the federal level .

on top of it all , women CEOs are creating jobs at a rate nearly four times the national average .
Mr. Peter Goldring ( Edmonton East , Ref. ) :
instead of ranting and raving for the benefit of the cameras , instead of turning this into a public circus and saying things like the federal government is destroying something it has built , perhaps the hon. member would entertain a constructive suggestion .
moreover they hide the fact that 54 percent of the cuts made were to social programs , health care and education .
i want to say a little bit more about that in a bit more detail .
Mr. Speaker , all ministers were instructed that if charges of this nature are brought to their attention , it is their duty to inform the police immediately .
this bill amends the Immigration Act to prevent the assessment of the right of landing fee on immigrants in addition to the application fee .
in subsequent years , these fell by 13 percent to $ 105 billion .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :

there was a time when a majority of the members of the House had rural and agricultural backgrounds .
we enhanced longer sentences for young offenders convicted of first and second degree murder .
Mr. Louis Plamondon
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
only a government and a minister hopelessly committed to the status quo would regard the tinkering in the bill as substantive change , to use the words of the minister .
Mr. John Solomon
privilege , on the other hand , can be divided into two finite categories : the rights extended to members individually , and those extended to the House as a collectivity .
we cannot bring the program back into balance without making some adjustments .
on April 22 the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs proposed that members and senators analyse the proposed amendment by asking and answering three fundamental questions .
we want to make sure that they have a good retirement pension plan .
perhaps it started with the Liberals and the national energy program , an arrogant , me first initiative that gouged the west and catered to the east .
Yap , yap , who cares ?
the Deputy Speaker :
can the Minister of Human Resources Development explain to us why his government is intent on punishing a generation of Canadians in retirement when it has taxed them to death during their working years ?
this was due in part to an increase in employment insurance premium revenues ( up $ 0.3 billion ) attributable to the acceleration of monthly payments .
we have been addressing this during question period over the last several days and we will continue to address it in question period and every other chance we get .
we know the government ' s view on this subject has changed since it was in opposition .
madam Speaker , I have many comments to make on the biased and twisted speech just delivered by the hon. member .
i am pleased to take part in today ' s debate on the Speech from the Throne , but before beginning , Madam Speaker , I too want to congratulate you on your appointment as Acting Speaker of the House , and to wish you good luck .
from the moment that it came to the attention of the justice officials that Ted Thompson had been to see the chief justice , steps were taken to find out exactly what happened , to get copies of the correspondence and put them in the hands of the lawyers involved in the three cases .
Mr. Speaker , the reports in this instance seem to imply the involvement of a number of foreign governments , the Israeli government , the Jordanian government and perhaps other governments .

does this amendment meet the test of Canadian national interest ?
with respect to contributions , the rates will rise over the next six years to 9.9 % of contributing earnings .
agreed .
i seem to be hitting a nerve .
other federal ministers will also attend .
* * *
i suggest one of the other ingredients which the premiers are starting to talk about is a rebalancing of the powers and also institutional change .
it is breaking the barriers of time and distance , and it is magnifying the role international developments play in our prosperity .
even if the government revamps the Canada pension plan , if spending is out of control , it will get nowhere at all .
with respect to the TAGS issue , first and foremost , the Atlantic groundfish strategy is under the purview of the Minister of Human Resources Development .
what should the federal government do when tax revenues begin to exceed our costs ?
Mr. Speaker , five months after condemning in this House the civil war in Algeria , the Canadian government has yet to call upon the international community to find a peaceful solution .
thank goodness the majority of the Canadian people oppose going off in that direction .
it is simply scandalous that the hon. member for Durham , with the cheerleading crowd from Ontario , and Reform members can stand and say that there should be more tax cuts .
some hon. members :
who in cabinet vetoed her for the throne speech ?
our youth are enticed through a wide open legal door into prostitution and the supply of dangerous drugs has not been stemmed .
as stated in Erskine May , 21 st edition , at page 115 :

i can also inform hon. members that there are many difficulties involved in this job .
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
there in the Senate Chamber there was no sense of need or desperation , no sense that so many people out there are stretched to the limit .
i have no qualms about it ; I say so publicly .
because the government was shortsighted and unable to sort out its own priorities .
the government has finally listened to the Bloc Quebecois , which has always stressed the importance of rehabilitation .
Mr. Gilles - A .
we will discuss this and more at the first ministers meeting this fall .
was this search warrant executed at his ministerial office ?
Mrs. Pierrette Venne
my argument this morning is that the restructuring of the plan in terms of the increase in premiums is regressive , too much of a burden on low income people .

he spoke about making it more progressive .
this government is no stranger to consultation .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis

he said we should not shift the burden of the price to the youth coming along in the future .
why was Pierre Corbeil not immediately suspended ?

in spite of losing the first two games to the Burnaby Lakers they persevered and came back to win their next four games to take the best seven championship round in six games .
the budget surplus we are about to have is built on the sacrifices of all Canadians , and they all deserve to reap the consequences .
Mr. Speaker , Michael Campbell , host of the Saturday morning radio show Money Talks recently presented his listeners with a startling example of the effect of compound interest .
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) :
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett
Mr. Speaker , the Liberals are on the take and they just keep on taking .
are these kind of spending programs really more important to the Liberals than offering some prospect of tax relief for the ordinary Canadian citizen ?
the Liberals talk about job creation .
i urge members to gives some thought to the concerns my colleagues and I will be raising .
Mr. Wayne Easter
before I become too involved in my speech I would like to congratulate you on your election to the Speaker ' s Chair .
is it not wonderful that the Prime Minister does not subtract days spent fishing in Labrador from a minister ' s shelf life .
we want leaders to be forthright and have character .
to distribute the administration of these funds to hundreds or thousands of fund administrators across the country makes very little sense at a time when we should be looking at better ways of spending our money .
canada rallied behind a team that refused to give up even when defeat seemed inevitable .
Mr. Speaker , I assure the minister that this party is just as happy with all the immigrants who come into this country legally as her party is .
instead , the government has gone back to the traditional , old 1970 s Liberal policies of bigger government , chequebook politics , trying to buy the votes of its special interest friends by opening up the treasury yet once more for all its pet projects .
yea .
our amendment reflects a difference of opinion in the House , an alternative to be debated .
i pledge today my party ' s support to further the goals of that treaty and rid the world of all inhumane weapons of war .
what are the Liberals doing about it ?
arthritis MONTH
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) :
what I said to my provincial partners is that we are going to work toward pharmacare as a long term goal because this government believes that in the long term the partners should work with us in creating a system where every citizen of this country should have access to the drugs they need and should not be kept from them because of price .
that is a solid controlling majority .
earlier the minister took great pains to justify his rush to get this recycled bill back through the House .
we were informed , accurately so , that this plan could not continue as it is without getting into serious financial difficulty .
youth unemployment is certainly far too high .
the United States has already passed similar legislation to defend the institution of marriage .
with the help of all Canadians our economic fundamentals are now the best they have been in 35 years .
multiculturalism
there are some people who argue that the principal function of government is to clear the decks , clear the obstacles out of the way of the strong and the cream will rise to the top , whether that cream be rich and powerful individuals or rich and powerful regions of the country .
before closing let me touch on a separate but related issue , Canada ' s children .
adjournment PROCEEDINGS
i would like to draw to members ' attention the presence in the gallery of His Excellency Viktor Petrovich Orlov , Minister of Natural Resources of the Federation of Russia .

that is why this Speech from the Throne is important to them .
there is no penalty for non - performance .

along the same lines is the issue of resources available to committees .
just like our industries must be capable of innovation , so must our Parliament be ready to change .
i think there was a time when some Canadians were buying into that type of rhetoric , that kind of down talk .

i beg the indulgence of members of the House to hear me out this morning .
my constituents call upon the government to enact legislation to wind down the Canadian pension plan and allow Canadians to contribute to mandatory RRSPs of their own choosing .

it has reduced the deficit from $ 42 billion to under $ 14 billion .
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre .
it is important that we look at the reality behind the words .
when the government spends $ 42,000 on a musical study entitled " The Social Origins of the Medieval Latin Lyrical Song , " why should ordinary Canadians believe that the government will ever be able to give Canadians the tax relief they deserve ?
little did I know that her answer would touch us both in such a profound way .
in the words of defence counsel quoting Lord Denning , " Had this occurred in England , it would have brought down the government '' .

the share of all such taxes in voluntary labour income , a term which can be interpreted as an effective payroll tax rate " and he goes on and on .
a change of statute , a vote in this Parliament , is required for the MPs of the class of '97 to have the option of opting out of the MP pension plan .
four years later , the cost has reached $ 365 million and the computer system is still not operational .
this failure clearly shows that the will of Quebeckers means nothing to the Conservatives , that their leader would rather speak for the rest of Canada than for his constituents and the Quebec people .
i hope that by pointing out this fact to the House we will be able to instil these principles into the collective political conscience of the House .
Mr. Speaker , yes .
this is very much a plan that requires a joint effort .
the Denturists Association of Canada seeks to promote nationwide standards and common legislative treatment in all provinces .
the fact that benefits received will be based on the average of the past five years ' earnings instead of three means that for most recipients pensions will be 3.7 percent lower than in the present system .
i will try to explain .
Mr. Grant Hill
my hon. friend is right .
i want to tell members what my parents told me .
canada may have had its rough spots and tough times , but I am willing to give everything I have to addressing the concerns of Canadians , whether they live in Quebec or British Columbia , and to preserving the country I love .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
it is important to get them on record so that Canadians know the consultation with respect to the CPP is just beginning and will be ongoing .
teachers
from agriculture and forestry to manufacturing and the service industries , each sector is well represented in our economy .
there is also another company from my riding that opened a plant in Quebec , Arriscraft .
Quebec however has a way out : relaim all its powers and achieve sovereignty in a hurry .
asbestos INDUSTRY
i invite my friends to consider what the Reform Party would do if it was in government .
it is a government able to exercise its obligations .
i am very happy to be here today .
conseil QU 脡 B 脡 COIS DU PATRIMOINE VIVANT
we would bring in an improved survivor benefit .
these things just are not true .
he still has a lot of work on this file , though , in returning to the shelves products that have been removed arbitrarily and also in shutting down these Codex activities .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
speech FROM THE THRONE
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
this study reveals that this group is much more entrepreneurial and positive than usually depicted .
we must create a new balance of powers if we want the Confederation to be adapted to the needs of its provincial partners .
i would like to point out to the hon. member that the government , in the throne speech , far from giving up its power to spend , the spending power of the federal government , has just shown that it intends to do the opposite .
speech FROM THE THRONE
my life was not that much different from the lives of most Canadians of my generation .
these scholarships will make post - secondary education more accessible and affordable and will help young Canadians prepare for the knowledge based society of the next century .
many members have indicated that the current beneficiaries of the CPP are getting a high amount .
the changes would provide the board with more flexibility in the acquisition and the pricing of wheat and barley enabling it to operate more efficiently , increase returns to farmers and reduce the risk to government .
it is indeed comforting to know that we can count on our colleagues .
i forgot to tell you I was sharing my 20 minutes with my colleague for Broadview - Greenwood .
he supported the establishment of the Canadian study of the parliamentary group and he represented this institution in the Parliament of the World with distinction .
are we not under an obligation as members to bring that to the House , including the relationship between the House and the Senate ?
we must equip our children with the capacities they need to be ready to learn and participate fully in our society '' .
in understanding that , and in reading the report of the royal commission and in understanding how we are going to make life better for aboriginal Canadians we know they have to have concrete autonomy .
employment
there has been a benefit of $ 17 billion in taxes from free trade .
it means responding to emerging issues in health care .
changes will limit the extent to which these benefits can be added together .
thanks largely to tax increases there is a huge and growing surplus in the employment insurance fund , subdued growth in public debt charges and cuts in provincial transfers for health , education and welfare .
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia )
he used to be the member for Ontario ; that was easy enough to remember , but I forget what his new riding is called .
Ms. Val Meredith
of course I am going to recognize the hon. member for Charlotte .
the government ' s premise that it is important to get this legislation to committee for debate is simply false .
Mr. Norman Doyle ( St. John ' s East , PC ) :
better yet , the CRTC should be completely revised from the bottom up so that we can get on with the business of building Canada as it should be built , as the technological centre that it could be in the world .
there is no change in the contribution rates past the 9.9 % that is being set now .
pursuant to Standing Order 108 ( 3 ) ( d ) , this document is deemed to have been permanently referred to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
first , the CPP will be refinanced at the expense of low income people , particularly women .
as more countries industrialize we cannot assume that our share of global investment will remain constant .
i believe that member is now the House leader for the Reform Party .
if they are not satisfied with how the CWB deals with farmers or its sales strategy or the way it does business , they will have the authority to change things as they see fit democratically .
i can say however that it is urgent and very important for our community to see support from the government for the automotive industry .
the majority of Albertans in the consultation said that any surpluses in the Alberta government coffers should go toward paying the debt of the province .
i was elected in my community , which is a disadvantaged community in downtown Toronto , on the basis that we have been through a lot of belt tightening .
we need to plan for them .
we talked to him last night in Amman .
bill C - 227 .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
it is not just democratic consent , it is also the rule of law , which I would have assumed .
madam Speaker , perhaps the best way to answer the question would be with another question so that the members could get the meaning .
a recent study by the International Bureau of Education confirmed that the quality of life and social status of 50 million teachers across the world had dropped drastically .
will he answer the question directly ?
we ask where are the commitments in this speech from the throne to debt reduction targets and tax reduction targets ?
as a fellow New Brunswicker , Mr. MacRae served the people of New Brunswick well .
to their knowledge , there is currently nobody working for me who is under investigation .
later on we will see very briefly , through excerpts from Mr. Scraire ' s report , that this was not the case , although the Caisse did play an important role in a number of businesses in Quebec .
he formed a vibrant partnership with his beautiful wife Bessie , who for many years has been a tireless worker in the community .
Mr. Julian Reed :
moreover , the new investment fund will grow gradually in its first few years .
my wife Gloria would ask too , has she done what she set out to do in being the best leading example of motherhood to our sons .
on this matter , unless the member has some facts to put on the table he should not rely on reports and allegations which are not true .
there is an opportunity now to challenge ourselves with the task of building a truly profoundly important future for ourselves and our kids .
the current government has steadfastly refused to take action .
if they funnel the money to Toronto we will be in a lot of trouble throughout Canada , Quebec being a special case because we have our own organization there .
that is why things are lively .
the same section was applied to New Brunswick to enshrine the equality between the francophone community and the anglophone community .
i declare the motion carried .
Mrs. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) :
the Reform members who are chirping from their seats are concerned about being brought into this debate .
CSIS
those publications talked about a more democratic Canada .
the government of Canada worked with the provinces and through Parliament used the flexibility and creativity of our federal system to confront seniors ' poverty .
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
bill C - 4 .
nothing will stop the determination of my people , the Quebec nation , to reach liberty , to become a sovereign country .
i have every confidence in the citizens of Saint John and the other ridings of the Atlantic provinces .
the Constitution Act , 1867 , is amended by adding immediately after section 93 , the following :
i urge him to reread the history of political parties a little more carefully .
nationhood needs to be nurtured much like children need to be nurtured .
i look forward to the continuing debate .
they spoke with pride at being elected to this place .
this evokes memories of a time when some form of co - operation with the federal government was possible .
statements BY MEMBERS
this is not what being a responsible government means .
the official opposition may worship at the altar of laissez - faire , but we and the majority of Canadians know that laissez - faire economics can too often become the let them suffer public policy .
in Stornoway .
who provided him with this information ?
the argument is if it is mandatory , if it is taken off a worker ' s payroll , then it is a tax .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
speaking again of false comments made by the government , its members seem to want to imply that Reform ' s plan is to scrap CPP and instead simply have people put their money into RRSPs .
is this progress ?
i want to serve notice that I will be watching .
this morning , I read in the newspaper that the Minister of Finance himself had a meeting with volunteer organizations and urged them to apply for federal funding .
the changes put forward by the federal government were approved , as the act provides , by at least two thirds of the provinces representing two thirds of the population of Canada .
Mr. Mark Assad
that is what the minister has tried very hard to do .
are these the kinds of programs that he thinks are wasteful and ought to be eliminated ?
they do not want self - employed entrepreneurs to know that they will soon be paying a tenth of their earnings straight into the finance minister ' s slush fund .
those were the very documents Mr. Dubin had access to during his investigation .
almost every family in Canada has in some manner been touched by this disease .
however , if there are new facts members would like to bring forth , I will listen to some brief comments .
let me share a secret with the Prime Minister .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
the Department of Human Resources Development has about six million Canadian clients to whom we are trying to give a break which will allow them to have a better quality of life .
however , the Bloc Quebecois denounces the fact that , in Canada , the onus of bilingualism is on the francophones .
Mr. Speaker , I share the concerns of the hon. member .
it has taken us 27 years to get out of a deficit situation but the government , ignorant of the 27 years that have gone before us , now seems intent on going back and starting to spend all over again .
Mr. Speaker , we learned through the newspapers that the premiers , including the premier of Newfoundland , have decided to consult their fellow citizens regarding the Calgary declaration .
from now on - I am sure the members of the opposition will agree with this - whenever provincial governments borrow from the Canada pension plan they will pay the same rate of interest as they do on their market borrowings .
better news yet : these businesses are not all in high tech sectors .
the hon. member for Portage - Lisgar mentioned that his farmers are starving .
these people have to rely on welfare .
Mr. Speaker , all that warm fuzzy talk has simply served to delay this project two and a half years and place it in jeopardy .
edited HANSARD * NUMBER 1
that is an important reminder that the seat we occupy is not ours .
i close with the immortal words of Longfellow when he said , let us work and leave behind us footprints in the sands of time .
i will not let them down .
they should be recalled .
we should ever be mindful of the fact that our actions in this House are transmitted by television into the homes of the nation where the impressionable young minds of children witness our respect or our lack of respect for each other as we debate the issues of the day .
i am pleased the government ' s objectives are in the national pharmacare program , the maintenance of our HIV - AIDS strategy and the commitment to deal with the unique needs of our aboriginal communities .
the hon. member was asking whether or not the House recognizes the existence of a Quebec people ; given the importance of that question , I will turn to the NDP member and ask him if , as a representative of the New Democratic Party , he can give us an answer .
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) :
he said :
another thing this bill attempts to do involves harmonizing .
if his way to solve the problems of the nation is by mailing a letter , we better not have a post office strike .
Mr. Preston Manning
Mr. Speaker , we have been working with aboriginal communities and with my provincial counterparts .

oral QUESTION PERIOD
there is no such request from Manitoba and one finds it hard to imagine a unanimous request from Manitoba on such a matter .
Mr. Speaker , at the beginning of the election campaign we said that we would spend some of our fiscal dividend on health care .
i must give you the following information , which is important to the debate .
Ms. Sophia Leung
and for all of the social programs , every time a dollar was cut from social programs in Quebec , 78 cents of it were used to reduce the Minister of Finance ' s deficit .
it provided the attraction of low contributions to those first in and a high rate of return exceeding what could be expected in any normally funded investment plan .
fisheries
the Speaker :
a more smoothly operating federation is the key to our future .
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
minority rights are , of course , an important element in the balance of a community .
does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs agree with me that legislation was properly and duly passed in the Quebec National Assembly , which is said to be the only national redress act ever to have been passed in Quebec , and I am referring to Bill 101 ?
that will be a huge fund .
i also congratulate all members of the House on their election to the House of Commons .
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Pierrefonds - Dollard , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I think I got the gist of the question in the first 30 seconds but I am sure with the additional rhetoric that we really got it .
apparently the government has decided to spend $ 1.5 million to subsidize smokes for convicts in the Kingston penitentiary .
we are in the global economy and in order for us to create jobs and be competitive against the rest of the world we cannot afford to continue with high costs .
this is laughable , Madam Speaker , because regarding credibility , if you look at the facts , I won the election by 9,000 votes .
i want to speak now to the essence of the bill .
has anyone calculated how much money a person makes at $ 6.25 an hour for 35 hours a week and how much that person is paying for child care ?
there is a veteran customs officer we have just heard about who is going to be blowing the whistle on the corruption at Revenue Canada .
the income from the fund will reward academic excellence and will provide thousands of scholarships each year , beginning in the year 2000 for low and moderate income Canadians to help them attend universities and colleges .
we must each remember our own family , and those governing us must do the same .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
we ask the government to be more prudent and reduce its spending .
two years ago Dudley George was shot dead .
i give it to him for his information .
that initiative has been going nowhere .
these basic features of the CPP would remain the same but there are some changes that are being proposed by the legislation .
what about that ?
while Kitchener enjoys steady growth , the health of a community cannot be measured solely in economic terms .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
i regret to say that this legislation will not improve the situation significantly .
he provided me with a vision of a better day as well as a weekly allowance and occasionally the keys to the family car .
it is my duty to inform the House that a second ballot will be necessary .
in the early 1990 s New Zealand introduced citizen initiated referenda into its parliamentary system .
will they assist us to get a reduction in the HST to help the pensioners and those with low incomes in Atlantic Canada ?
Mr. Rick Borotsik :
petitions
BCE INC.
that is also what happens with the Liberal Party .
i am only a modest woodsman , but I fear he may have been hit on the head by a piece of wood .
the Chair finds it difficult to believe that that is a point of order .
it has contributed greatly to making Canada the best country in the world in which to live .
* * *
a consensus has been forged , and as the intergovernmental affairs minister has noted that consensus is sufficiently broad for us to go ahead with the proposed change .
the Deputy Speaker :
they want to take 10 percent of our wages for a program that will not be around when we need it .
we think those people who buy grain should determine when it moves , not the people producing it and not the people in the Canadian Wheat Board .
madam Speaker , I knew I was keeping him up .
everybody agrees that research and development is a key component for any society wishing to be fully prepared for the 21 st century .
in any event I am sure the hon. Minister for Human Resources Development would want to review the procedures in his department and take any necessary action .
it will not be fully funded but there will be more funding than we have had in the past .
amendment to the amendment negatived
the difference is that we wanted the government to reduce it by cutting its insatiable spending appetite , by cutting the grants and handouts that are rampant throughout the waste reports , by cutting the patronage organizations , such as the western economic diversification fund and the economic development funds that are in eastern Canada , all the hundreds of millions of dollars that it gives to Quebec companies to keep the Bloc off its back .
( official Version )
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
there is some relationship between our tax system and that of the United States .
Mr. Jerry Pickard
the amount of the pension will continue to depend on how much and for how long a person contributes to that plan .
there is a quorum .
more , more .
Mr. Ren 茅 Laurin
at the same time , I would ask that an order of the day be designated for consideration of a motion .
as their federal member of Parliament , my duty is to galvanize the will of the citizenry of the great riding of Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke , to represent their voice here on Parliament Hill bravely , with intense passion , fervent conviction and undying and unyielding determination so that we may travel through the 1990 s and into the next millennium proud of our noble heritage , supported by our family and friends , enriched by our diversity of talent , invigorated by our unity of vision , empowered by our infinite hope , our undying optimism and our indomitable spirit .
the Canada pension plan which came in in 1966 has as its hallmark the fact that it is a universal program .
the throne speech also speaks to the need to create opportunities for youth .
it was Canadians who came through the depression of the thirties , through the war in the forties .
we believe we will accommodate that concern through this bill .
he heard what the youth who came before us had to say .
subsidies designed by the government to entice people toward particular actions and to move them in particular directions are the exact opposite of taxes .
i move :
the budget is scheduled for the month of February .
an example of that is the Canada foundation for innovation .
when will we be told that a premier representing an English speaking province has decided to retain the services of Jojo the fortune teller to find out what the public in his province thinks ?
these various people in my riding have learned to work and celebrate together .
supreme COURT OF CANADA
will the Deputy Prime Minister tell us what concrete measures his government has taken to ensure that in future no one will have access to Department of Human Resources Development funding lists ?
before proceeding , the Chair feels that it might be helpful to explain to members , and especially to new members of this House , the difference between a contempt of the House and a breach of privilege .
Mrs. Pauline Picard
Ms. Alexa McDonough
we love to have the opportunity to salute their efforts .
this was to be done in co - operation with provincial ministers and representatives .
we also need to look at how the plan affects middle class Canadians and how it will affect their working years .
everything has been according to the chronometer .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
taxation
i know that opposition members of all parties will work with us to make Canada a better and better place in which to live where no one will be left behind .
Mr. Speaker , if the House gives its consent I would move :
people are no longer being taken in by this sort of antic .
when we came to power , there was a $ 6 billion deficit .
but the Prime Minister did not specify what kind of means .
we believe this money belongs to the Canadian taxpayers and we are going to acknowledge that by going and talking to them .
of course we will address these concerns when the legislation is considered in committee .
bill C - 4 stipulates as the minister said that 10 of the 15 members of the board of directors are to be elected by farmers with the minister naming the remaining five .
why wait for the near , or more distant , future ?
you certainly deserve it , having proven your mettle in the 35 th Parliament , and I trust you will be just as vigilant in the 36 th .
Mr. Speaker , if we had been given a chance , I think we could have changed it in a positive way .
i want to thank all hon. members who have taken part in giving me the information I have before me now .
i submit that we are winning this game .
liberal and Tory governments have gleefully borrowed everything they could get their hands on for the past 25 years .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i often point out to high school students when I talk to them that if they stacked up one hundred dollar bills about this high that would be a million dollars and if they stacked up our debt in one hundred dollar bills it would be about 1,200 kilometres high .
in view of that , my question for this member is , how is it then that he was reluctant to support the amendment that we put forward on the issue that was before us yesterday since the principle is identical ?
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member .
i would add , though , that marketing boards do not necessarily increase the price to the producer .
as my leader said yesterday , I also register a great deal of sadness at not being able to enter this Chamber and see my old friend and colleague , Stanley Knowles , sitting at the table .
hon. Andy Scott
however , I will get the specific details for him .
they are well represented .
the proposed changes will strengthen our system to permit it to continue to provide Canadians with the opportunity to create for themselves new and sufficient retirement income .
we were shown the passports by Jordanian government officials in the early stages of the investigation .
first , it is noteworthy that the Quebec government is not seeking to exclude any reference to religion in education , but rather to secularize the administrative structures .
they have a right to live fulfilling , independent lives and to travel about freely .
i will always be grateful for the trust and confidence they have placed in me over the years .
this is probably the most preposterous statement I ever heard .
does the minister have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motions ?
the Speaker :
hon. Anne McLellan
Mr. Speaker , that is in the bill exactly as the hon. member has said .
these issues are coming from Canadians , issues they want dealt with in the Canadian pension plan .
i want to explain that for a couple of minutes .
they undermine the federation .
more than any other reason it is because of the development of our resources .
truth is funny , sometimes .
the reforms are supported by Newfoundland , Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , Prince Edward Island , Quebec , Ontario , Manitoba and Alberta .
these social engineers have staked their reputations , even their views of the world , on this framework of centralizing more jobs , but the anomalies are overwhelming .
is it agreed ?
Mr. Speaker , it is with some emotion , and understandably so , that I address this House for the very first time .
we are one of the most accountable people in the land simply because if the people of Canada , the electorate , do not like us or are not satisfied with us they can fire us every four or five years , or whatever the case may be .
hon. Allan Rock
Mr. Jack Ramsay
i am sincerely sorry , Mr. Speaker , for using the word " stealing '' .
speech FROM THE THRONE
Ms. Albina Guarnieri ( Mississauga East , Lib . ) :
i am going to make a prediction , and this will be very short .
the hon. member has heard her colleague for Anjou - Rivi 猫 re - des - Prairies , in answer to my question as to whether he , as a member of the government , recognized Quebecers as a people , reply " Yes , of course '' .
our social safety net was also falling apart , not being able to address our needs today let alone the needs of the future .
that is why our party over the years has been a very strong supporter of the Canada pension plan , the Quebec pension plan and public pension plans in general .
madam Speaker , as a member of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri - Food , I am very honoured to take part in the House of Commons debate on Bill C - 4 to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act .
the Liberals bought off the provinces with promises of cheap loans that would be available due to the federal government ' s extra CPP tax revenue .
this is a concocted argument by the Reform Party in a desperate attempt to find some way of getting pubic attention .
the hon. member ' s government took $ 182 million away from the veterans programs in the last three and a half years .
now it has to be unanimous .
the question is on the main motion .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy :
as individuals we are tired of the tax burden that we carry .
the Canadians who risked their lives in 1942 in their raid on Dieppe and in June 1944 on the beaches of Normandy understood that .
it had a bumpy start in Newfoundland as well .
i do not recall any ads running based on the 50 percent spending promise .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
those who pay into the plan have their spouses protected in case of death or disability .
they have broken their promises .
i would now like to address one area about which I am particularly passionate , the arts in Canada .
this is a bill for western Canada , since 95 % of the volume administered by the CWB comes from the provinces of Manitoba , Saskatchewan , Alberta , and parts of Ontario and British Columbia , that is the region designated in Bill C - 4 .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Peter MacKay
consultation was done well before the election and when its recommendation came back one of its highlights was to restore funding to a base of $ 12.5 billion .
Mr. Grant Hill
at present the natural resources industry is confronted by many impediments to its continued contribution to Canadian employment and wealth creation .
madam Speaker , it is true that Quebec was the first province in Canada to limit the election expenses of parties and candidates and to reimburse candidates for part of their expenses .
these are very important initiatives .
that is not part of Canada ' s history , tradition or values .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member will have to take another look at the throne speech , because there are several references to what we are going to do and have been doing for some time now .
Mr. Hec Clouthier ( Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke , Lib . ) :
these Canadians deserve some equity .
the federal government has been trying to initiate discussions with the provinces .
that is the best way to respond .
since I will continue to act as health critic , my comments today will pertain mainly to the throne speech sections that touched on health issues .
Mr. Speaker , may I first thank the people of Madawaska - Restigouche who expressed their confidence in me on June 2 .
this is a savings plan , an investment fund that will be managed by an independent body .
as soon as I landed on its soil I felt at once a sense of security .
we normally let members deliver their speech without being interrupted .
this is just one initiative , the scholarship fund , but there are many others that we have engaged in through the ministers of human resources and finance who have put forward a youth strategy to assist the youth of this country .
the purpose of this bill is to target individuals who have clearly demonstrated to the Canadian public that they willfully disregard the basic essence of respect for another person ' s life .
perhaps they will stand and denounce this kind of irresponsibility .
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
and when -
Mr. Grant Hill
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased that the member for Qu 茅 bec East is questioning my memory , because my memory of the period when the GST decision was taken is very clear , exceptionally so .
i would have thought the number one issue would be jobs .
each year the rate of unemployment is somewhere between 16 and 17 % and the activity rate for young people between the ages of 15 and 24 is dropping .
madam Speaker , I rise to speak to the motion put forward by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs on the establishment of a joint committee of the House of Commons and the Senate to study matters related to the proposed resolution respecting the amendment to section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 , concerning the Quebec school system .
we can see that the Supreme Court , biased as it is , is under the control of a regime that puts partisan interests before ethics .
justice
twenty years after the Employment Equity Act was passed , three rulings in favour of the workers and two election campaign promises later , does the Minister recognize that the time has finally come to open the public purse and quickly settle the issue of pay equity ?
i am proud also to represent the area of Old Strathcona , a wonderfully unique Bohemian community of small business , artists and students .
i encourage them and all members to join together to deal with the many challenges facing our youth .
i would like to thank the people of Parkdale - High Park who have placed their trust and confidence in me to represent their interests in the House of Commons .
all the evidence suggests that federally sentenced women , having already suffered from male abuse , will suffer more in a male dominated institution .
the House should not have dispensed with its constitutional duty so cavalierly , without debate and without concern .
this mechanism would affect about 700,000 federal workers , people who do not necessarily work for the federal government but who come under the jurisdiction of the federal labour code .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
( 3 ) Where in any Province a System of Separate or Dissentient Schools exists by Law at the Union or is thereafter established by the Legislature of the Province , an Appeal shall lie to the Governor General in Council from any Act or Decision of any Provincial Authority affecting any Right or Privilege of the Protestant or Roman Catholic Minority of the Queen ' s Subjects in relation to Education ;
it is because of the orientation the government had toward its fiscal agenda .
they believe the future prosperity of the grain farmer lies in the direction of following marketing principles that have served well in the past .
in fact , we can think of nothing that was done at all .
when we listen to the finance minister I believe he assumes that since everything is well on Wall Street and Bay Street , that everything is well in the rest of Canada .
hon. Don Boudria :
my parents , in return , invested in Canada by running a group home for over 25 years .
this award acknowledges the success and initiative that Parkdale residents have taken toward combating crime in their community .
public SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION ACT
at times when we are paying tribute and at other times in the debates , I would hope we would take the time to listen to what we all have to say in the House .
it is not as if he did not know what the people want .
Mr. Rahim Jaffer
we are going to have a public consultation and we are freezing further cuts .
she should instead encourage francophones outside Quebec and show what is happening among French Canadians .
i have here some figures about the different options if we had a government expenditure of $ 1 billion .
Mr. Speaker , it is a health question in terms of making sure that the people who operate our search and rescue helicopters have the best possible equipment because they do save lives .
almost half of our caucus received 50 percent or more .
the announcement for students is excellent news .
members
another thing worth pointing out in the debate today is that each year there is supposed to be a fishing plan agreed to by the U.S. and Canada .
they therefore call on Parliament to urge the federal government to join with the provincial governments to make a national highway system upgrade possible .
Ms. Karen Redman
Quebec City helped promote a nascent culture that blossomed through its contacts with many aboriginal nations .
what about federal political parties that become government and interfere and manipulate some of these arm ' s length groups ?
i thought just now that this Canadian fund will be a powerful instrument of centralization and that , if the objective was comparable to Quebec ' s objective , the provinces - certain provinces - who , at this time , are showing an interest in taking charge of their own development , and who do not trust the central government , or not completely , could worry that this powerful central instrument is not to their benefit .
on a point of order , Mr. Speaker .
government is not powerless .
Mr. Speaker , support for the French language here in Canada and around the world must include participation in the new technologies of the information highway .
this is in no small way as a direct result of our having a single desk seller of wheat and barely that combines size , global reach and marketing clout to bring about the best possible returns from its world markets .
it is due to government interference that this situation has developed into the state it is in now .
we are determined to do that .
i am pleased to take part in the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne and I look forward to spending another few years representing the people of Burin - St.
as well , government can support small business by arranging trade missions such as the successful team Canada initiatives and the November trade mission to Washington for women business owners .
like the government ' s youth international internship program , this conference will help youth gain the skills and contacts they need to enter the global marketplace .

we have called in the Israeli ambassador here .
Peggy Witte of Royal Oak Mines stated in answer to questions that Royal Oak Mines left Canada because of the high Canadian taxes which made it difficult to attract top - notch talent to fill positions in the company within Canada .
it is quite a lot of money already .
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) :
as regards the trail of wrongdoings now plaguing the government and the Liberal Party , five corporations , five businessmen informed the Minister of Human Resources Development that they had been asked for cash contributions , and asked to keep quiet about it .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
as to the protection of the passports , we have one of the most advanced systems for checking the security of our system .
our plan reduces intergenerational transfers which will become a major source of social stress .
in January 1996 she was appointed to the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development , again at taxpayers ' expense .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
the Minister of Foreign Affairs has obtained a commitment from the Israeli foreign minister to set up a consultative process with us to ensure that we can have a common understanding to prevent misuse of Canadian passports in the future .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
" we , the undersigned citizens of Canada , wish to point out to the House of Commons as follows :
i encourage the hon. member to contribute constructively to the process .
we will build creative partnerships between the private and public sectors to accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies in all sectors of the economy .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
i will sit down and look forward to what the government member has to say .
i would like to mention some examples of this commitment , for instance a balanced budget no later than 1998 - 99 .
new realities emerge and Canadians see and understand them .
he is an anglophone who is not a sovereignist .
of course it is not perfect , as an institution .
it is interesting to note that some members opposite talked about payroll taxes .
the Mr. Roy in question has sent a letter to the CBC asking it to retract , because his lawyers are saying he was never under investigation by the RCMP .
Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos ( Ahuntsic , Lib . ) :
we must find ways , perhaps through the tax system , to motivate businesses to fulfil this role .
the former member of Parliament and D - Day veteran died this past Sunday after a brief illness .
the Speaker :
Mr. Dennis J . Mills ( Broadview - Greenwood , Lib . ) :
we speak past each other , we speak around each other , but we do not speak to each other .
the Liberals like to pass on to Canadians the myth that their finances are in order .
it was not very good .
it is no accident that Canada is expected to record the highest rate of employment and growth of all the G - 7 countries this year and next .
Mr. Rick Borotsik
Mr. Speaker , that is simply not so .
the fact is lower taxes , not higher spending , is the way to job creation .
its primary purpose is to deal with conduct related issues that can hinder the proper operation of our democratic institutions .
Mr. Speaker , many members would agree , I am sure all , that this Parliament is off to a good start .
the leader of the government in the other place is a fellow Nova Scotian .
maybe they should stay out of the OECD a little more , move away from Paris and Sweden or the Norwegian countries .
any speculation to the contrary is false , and I know the hon. member is not part of this speculation .
in Newfoundland two school systems are being combined to create one public school system .
simply put , the Speech from the Throne is an example of this belief in action .
in addition these young people do not consider $ 8,800 a year a meaningful pension when investment of the same contributions in an RRSP over the same period of time would give them a pension of $ 24,000 a year .
we have had an historic day today .
Mr. Speaker , I repeat , if the hon. member looks at what happened last week with the reduction in long term interest rates , mortgage rates have been at an all time low .
parliamentarians of all parties will be given the opportunity to suggest activities to mark the millennium .
in this respect we need to compare the ideas that have been put forward , some of them during the election campaign on our side .
procedure and House Affairs
i would be much more encouraged if I had heard a much stronger commitment in the throne speech to relieving my grandchildren of the burden of this national debt , giving my children the opportunity that tax relief would allow them in a more innovative and entrepreneurial environment .
an hon. member :
i would appreciate it if the hon. members were honest in what he says in the House .
the hon. member raised a concern about campaign financing .
Mr. Speaker , it is with pleasure that I rise today to recognize world teachers day which was celebrated yesterday .
first it was a report from the B.C. adviser on national unity warning of the potential of western separation .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
and it is obvious after hearing the throne speech that the government plans to deliver both to Canadians .
Mr. Speaker , I think most of that tirade scarcely merits an answer .
it could start by doing two things .
English Canada will not admit at all that Quebec is different .
it means that it is a higher burden on the Canada pension plan system to deal with it .
this came out of the Prime Minister ' s office .
standards often are not as high as we find in neighbouring jurisdictions such as the United States .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
those of you who believe the polls , who try to say that we are not legitimate and that the people of Quebec do not want sovereignty , are in for some surprises .
Mr. Gerald Keddy
the country is that much more vulnerable when the debt is $ 600 billion .
the hon. member for Kootenay - Columbia on one question .
that was an initiative with IRAP , the grape growers and the wine industry .
agreed .
the Liberal government will continue to create more opportunities for our youth , opportunities for better education , more employment opportunities , a healthier lifestyle and a secure public retirement income system .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :

Mr. Yvon Godin :
introduction and first reading
political CONTRIBUTIONS
i also want to express my regrets to those members particularly from New Brunswick who served in the 35 th parliament and were not re - elected .
i do not think so .
does the Minister of Health intend to keep his government ' s promise to make the legislation more flexible in order to satisfy international racing event organizers ?
October is breast cancer awareness month .
hon. Lyle Vanclief
i ask all hon. members to be very judicious in their choice of words .
we are competent , we are competitive and we are confident .
the federal government is not standing in the way of internal trade barriers .
Mr. Speaker , I first want to indicate to my hon. friend that the super RRSP solution is in our judgment not the answer .
there has been a flip - flop on the government side .
maybe what they should do in the Quebec legislature is look at how to refine and use the tools which we have given them , as opposed to exploiting them for their own agenda .
surely he acknowledges that people voted on many issues including primarily , I would argue , national unity .
income TAX ACT
i think your job is going to be interesting over the next four or five years .
we have some reservations about the proposed committee .
hon. David Kilgour
in summary , the hard work of all Canadians is beginning to pay off , but our job is not yet complete .
no wonder , Mr. Speaker , if he can keep buying his way into office .
our international competitors are not standing still , so neither can we .
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
and who has contributed over $ 70,000 to the Liberals in the past two years ?
instead of thinking about how life would be for Canadians stuck in this situation , the government was only hoping that no one would ask the difficult questions that would embarrass it .
for example , we share the view expressed by the member from Saint - Hubert in the last House that it is absurd to have senators who have no democratic legitimacy in either Quebec or Canada on a joint committee .
let us trust in producers as a group to make decisions which should properly be made by them because it has a direct impact on their livelihood .
the other is a compilation of selected quotes on Reform ' s fiscal policies and this is even better .
how does he regard their democratic rights understood in that context ?
the Prime Minister said that the federal government might consult Quebecers , going around the Government of Quebec and the National Assembly .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the comments and the question from my colleague from Frontenac - M 茅 gantic whom I worked with for some years on the environment committee in the last Parliament .
the Gronos would be alive today if the solicitor general ' s department had acted .
the system of initial in term adjustments and final payment has worked well .
as I said earlier , in my experience this probably makes good sense .
now that our house is back in order , it will be necessary for us to focus more strongly on these issues .
we see no acceptance of responsibility by the government in stonewalling the Krever inquiry .
now I am all cooled down and I can give a nice calm response to the speech .
Mr. Janko Peric
he talked about people who wanted to gut the benefits to the plan .
in a system totally dependent on RRSPs those with most of the wealth would be benefiting from most of the tax loss as a result of the tax deduction .
in the province of Quebec , we know that , for some time now , the S 没 ret 茅 du Qu 茅 bec has been taking on a lot of responsibilities throughout the Quebec territory .
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Government of Canada has a system called the open bidding system .
i would like these questions to be addressed , for there is a cloud hanging over intergenerational equity .
the appointment of any political representative is an archaic practice that should have been forever consigned to the history of the 19 th century .
a visionary group of young men started the local Kinsmen Club 20 years ago .
with respect to youth unemployment , certainly Canada ' s level of youth unemployment is extremely high .
those people are not philanthropists .
again , I thank the hon. member for his kind remarks .
it deals with what the government House leader said .
it is a lesson that we can share with other Canadians .
routine PROCEEDINGS
given that Revenue Canada has not denied Mr. Coffey ' s allegations , is the minister prepared to investigate this matter and if not , why not ?
this is obviously a serious contradiction , one that is furthermore irrelevant to the debate on the issue before us , which is the fact that Quebec wants linguistic school boards and , as far as the government is concerned , that is no problem .
if more members of Parliament would take to heart his words of advice we would certainly have a better institution and a far better country .
i intend to move in a forward direction and that is why I joined the Liberal team here on this side of the House .
who then would have believed that four years later all the international forecasters would be predicting that Canada will enter the next millennium with the best economic performance of the G - 7 countries ?
in Canada we are fortunate to have police forces who carry out their daily work with honesty and integrity and dedication .
i would also like to thank my colleague from Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford for sharing her time this morning and I would like to thank my constituents for re - electing me to serve another term in the 36 th Parliament .
i support the establishment of the health transition fund that will help provincial governments innovate in the areas of primary care and provide more integration in the delivery of health services and innovative home care and pharmacare .
on the Stoney Reserve we heard that an aboriginal woman is living in a van because she protested against the chief and council and mysteriously her house burned down .
we were , supposedly , a protest vote .
however , we realize that some changes have become necessary , because of the financial implications and of the plan ' s sustainability .
children need a substantial investment of time and attention for healthy development ; they need strong families ; they need safe , supportive communities .
as in the previous parliament we have the Canada Foundation for Innovation .
the crimes show a need for greater responsibility on the parts of both parents and young people .
it speaks exactly to the heart of the bill .
the government will work closely with provincial and territorial governments to further advance the progress made by nine premiers and the territorial leaders last week in Calgary toward the full recognition of the diversity inherent in the federation , including the unique character of Quebec society .
Rhonda Pomeroy of Carrot River , Saskatchewan wrote : " I find it appalling that families who have a full time parent at home are at a disadvantage compared to homes where both parents work '' .
i find it strange that , in the 1996 election , there are no contributions from individuals , none .
Jonathan Kesselman , professor of Economics at the University of British Columbia , in the Canadian Tax Journal in 1996 , a journal which is often quoted by the Minister of Finance in the House writes that " the distinguishing trait of all payroll taxes is that they apply to a base of labour earnings only '' .
it is unacceptably high .
the words which have been uttered about him by all hon. members are very fitting .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
why do we not give Canadians the chance to have their individual account where they can see the money going in every month and receive a statement every month showing the growth in the plan , which would be protected by both the government and the private sector ?
Mr. Rahim Jaffer :
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) :

when we first came here in 1993 our analysis was that the federal financial vehicle had four flat tires .
madam Speaker , as this is the beginning of the 36 th Parliament , I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people of Drummond for once again demonstrating their faith in me .
he may be aware that during the negotiations between the federal and provincial governments there was a proposal on the table from the Manitoba government , supported by our government , which would have seen mandatory credit splitting between spouses as CPP income is earned .
with this new fuller funding approach the CPP fund will grow substantially over the next two decades .
when they go about their riding consultation process are they going to point out that day after day as long as Reformers sit in the House , that they have indemnity from any sort of prosecution ?
there is some irony here .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
i think she would know that all of us in this House welcome members who are women .
we stand at a threshold , as we did in 1970 when the government last had a surplus budget .
i will argue that the sum of these two deliberate acts constitute a contempt of Parliament .
Mr. Jerry Pickard
would the Prime Minister or his minister agree that his program to measure the readiness of children to learn is , in fact , a foot in the door of the education sector , with all the consequences that involves : federal programs , federal assessment criteria , federal employees , and on top of that , taxpayers who will again pay twice as a result of this latest duplication ?
* * *
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand
Quebec is as important to us as any other province in which we have family members .
it must be clearly understood that , if we want to move into the new decade , the new millennium that is approaching , it is absolutely vital that we recognize problems before they arise .
at this time it is imperative that the prime minister proceed with caution .
on October 31 , like many thousands of Canadians , I was in shock and disbelief that our country could be lost for want of 100,000 votes .
not only are we restoring the treaty relationship in provinces like Saskatchewan and Alberta but in provinces like British Columbia where we did not get around to writing treaties we are now writing modern treaties .
i am sure the issue came up .
Ms. Paddy Torsney
the answer in the minds of many Canadians is no .
i have visited the areas to which she has referred and I have seen people who have died as a result of abusing drugs and using dirty needles .
regarding the information highway , the government talks of the urgency of making Canada " the most connected nation in the world '' .
we find Sesame Street economics .
we have the breakup of families .
recently we heard from a senior official who at one time was the assistant head of the health protection branch of the Department of Health , Dr. Mich 猫 le Brill - Edwards .
the Speaker :
parliament has too few friends .
that is what we are going to do .
he wants to sign deals with Israel .
much was made of the patriation debate or the Constitution of 1982 .
i find it really encouraging actually that the Reform Party has now come to the conclusion that the surplus is within sight .
we as a government have been able to do that over the past number of years not only effectively but efficiently .
we do not .
let me close by saying that all of these are but examples of things that must be done in the health portfolio in the coming years .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the comments of the hon. member .
paired
his contribution to the advancement of the Francophonie was acknowledged even by the government of Quebec which , in 1991 , inducted him into the Ordre des francophones d ' Am 茅 rique .
hear , hear .
in addition to thanking my constituents for their continued support I want to warmly welcome the new members to the House .
from my long experience I can say that the taste will be enormously satisfying , of course spicy at times but in the end satisfying .
the formation of a joint federal - provincial review panel to hear concerns regarding the Cheviot mine project in Alberta was an important first step toward establishing a national environmental assessment process based on nationally agreed upon standards .
is your department prepared to immediately conduct -

if he acts today he can put thousands of people back to work in the next few weeks by reducing employment insurance premiums , this tax , this rip - off on Canadians to the tune of billions of dollars .
Mr. Speaker , I can confirm in answering the question from the hon. member that in fact I did not speak to the RCMP about this case .
Mr. Yves Rocheleau
Mr. Peter Mancini
it was a beautiful sunny afternoon .
while I cannot speak to the specifics of the hon. member ' s expectations , there was no promise at that time to release confidential financial information of the band to him .
Mr. Speaker , are we to understand from what the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has said that , as far as he is concerned , Ottawa is home to the international standard of democracy and , therefore , every country in the world should consider that democracy in Ottawa is better than democracy in Quebec ?
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
at this point , allow me to make a short digression and to offer my most sincere condolences to the families and friends of the four teenagers who recently committed suicide in my riding .
that is very different from the private grain companies that often work on exploitation of primary producers , the kind of system that Reform members opposite seem to support .
i look forward to your ruling .
today , for every person of retirement age there are five persons of working age .
pretty smooth .

investing in our youth has the largest return for Canada .
the Speaker :
i would like the government to be more attentive in the next consultations than it was in previous ones , such as the consultations on the employment insurance reform .
it is hard to imagine how universities and hospitals , already faced with considerable budget constraints resulting from cuts in transfers to the provinces , will manage to meet this major challenge .
order , please .
our government has determined that youth employment should be a priority .
if it is a vision at all , it looks like we are sailing into the fog with faulty forecasts , with a ship they have not maintained and with an ill - prepared crew .
we do not have to look simply at the money we put in and the pension we will get out .
ordinary Canadians have no confidence in the future .
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew
he worked with union and management in order to try to bring about a settlement .
shippers are accountable for loading the grain at the right time in the right place .
we know what is relevant on this side of the House and we are going to preserve medicare .
technology Partnerships Canada , an investment fund with more than $ 250 million a year , will work with business to keep the development , marketing and production of new technologies in Canada where it will create jobs and foster new growth .
i put these points on the table to show what I believe is one of the greatest pressures on this institution .
in order to deal with that -
as such , he advised those present that if they pursued the matter legal advice would have to be sought before the meeting could continue .
i know that my leader expressed similar sentiments yesterday when she spoke to the Speech from the Throne .
the minister just said a couple of minutes ago the words " other people have seen the passports '' .

federal - provincial reviews will take place every three years , instead of every five .
i have had people visit my office who have been fearful for their lives .
i think that the farce now taking place -
the money to be managed by the corporation established by the bill belongs to the workers and future pensioners of Canada who are putting up the money .
he said , " The Canadian economy has the potential for a long period of sustained growth in output and employment , with rising productivity and improving living standards '' .
then there could be a stable predictable retirement system for Canadians in the future .
obviously it is anxious to get on a plan to go with the Prime Minister to another team Canada mission in Latin America .
in the past , Quebec ' s anglophone minority relied heavily on the Protestant school boards to ensure its development .
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to be able to respond to the question posed by my friend from Prince George .
first SESSION - 36 TH PARLIAMENT
possibly they did not work .
the Reform Party is very much against government programs that help ordinary people , but it is certainly in favour of spending billions and billions of dollars to subsidize the wealthy .
if it is necessary for me to get back to the House I will do so after a brief delay .
why is he playing Robin Hood in reverse in this country ?
honourable Members of the Senate / Members of the House of Commons :

we care about social housing problems .
i do think I speak for a large number of young Canadians .
there is a component for co - ordination , and there is , of course , the laboratory centre for disease control which is more concerned with epidemiology .
did they not see these things ?
if this were used extensively for a particular grain such as feed barley , the result could be that prices for feed barley in Canada would differ from prices in the United States only by actual transfer costs .
it is forecasting 9 per cent , 8 per cent next year and 7 per cent until the year 2015 .
Mr. Gilles - A .
one of the things I talked about spending money on was students , universities , research and development .
the member for Calgary Southwest complained this devolution was done purely for administrative means .
i look forward to working together with my colleagues for the betterment of Canada .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment to the amendment ?
i would say to him that the deep cuts to health , education and the important programs that people care about are directly a result of the commitment that the Government of Ontario made to cut personal income taxes by some 30 % before the budget was balanced .
the national child benefit process with the provinces produced a federal commitment of $ 850 million of investment in the Canadian child tax benefit .
first of all , I would like to express my surprise and disappointment at the throne speech ' s complete silence on women ' s concerns .
the opposition leader in his speech said that we have to make the survivor benefits fairer and that there should be a fairer distribution to middle and high income Canadians .
Canadians recognize the need for adjustments but they did not want to see a drastic change .
we would like to see the new system have accountability .
it is therefore difficult to believe that a new American immigration law will soon require that all Canadian travellers entering and exiting the United States complete a visa information card .
Mr. Mike Scott
so here are a few of the ideas of things that we believe in .

the Deputy Speaker :
the process was interrupted by the calling of the election .
certainly that was there when I was at university but now the social safety net is being torn apart .
we must make it law that politicians balance the budget .

we must initiate public policies to restore the confidence of Canadians in our health care system and I pledge to do my utmost to achieve that end .

speech FROM THE THRONE
interest rates are the lowest in 30 years , inflation is under control , the dollar is stable and investment is constantly increasing .
Mr. Speaker , Brian Mulroney used to run the government like his own personal club , making sure that Tory friends were well taken care of .
he will be very much missed .
Mr. Deepak Obhrai
it made me think that this is the last refuge for the vaguely talented on the opposite side .
however Canadians do have a right to know whether their government did act properly in response to the allegations that are before the Commons .
their policy was to bring it under control and these spendthrift Liberals as they call us could never do it .
our crime rate is lower than it has ever been .
i am also pleased to mention that the last federal budget provides for a $ 100 million increase , over a three year period , under the Canada prenatal nutritional program and the community action program for children .
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is interesting that this minister himself is responsible for the cuts that he is now undoing .
the Canadian Wheat Board affects primarily the people in the prairie provinces .
Mr. Speaker , the root of the problem is that a provincial government does not have the authority to proclaim itself the government of a sovereign state .
hon. Sheila Copps
that is what he would have us all do if we were to follow his advice .
there have been a lot of cuts .
Mr. Denis Coderre
he spent about 25 distinguished years in the House and I am delighted that the voters in Qu ' Appelle have decided to send him back to the House .
i think it is worth mentioning .

plain LANGUAGE ACT
Mr. Lorne Nystrom
he is making certain allegations and I want to know the names , the amounts and the companies who made contributions .
parliamentary privilege does not go much beyond the right of free speech in the House of Commons and the right of a Member to discharge his duties in the House as a Member of the House of Commons .
it is quite legitimate for the government and for this House to want to listen to ordinary Canadians , people from the private sector and the provinces as to why this measure is necessary in order to ensure a pension plan for our children and grandchildren .
they are contributions toward pensions .
the employment insurance system must be put at the service of the objectives we pursue in this area .
tabling of Documents , Statements by Ministers and so on .
what tools will the prime minister give to ordinary aboriginals to hold their band councils and the department of Indian affairs accountable ?
when we reach that time we will allocate every billion dollars of fiscal dividend so that one half will go to a combination of reducing taxes and reducing the national debt , and one half will address social and economic needs through program expenditures .
in my way , I want to contribute , in this House , to the creation of a country that we can call our own .
therefore I ask the minister of fisheries , the prime minister and the parliamentary secretary to the minister of fisheries to please move quickly on this very volatile situation which needs their immediate attention .
Mr. Speaker , that being the fact , it is imperative Canadians have confidence in the integrity of the prime minister and the cabinet .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member ' s question was answered in part yesterday and I answered the rest of it in my earlier responses to other members of the House .
i do not know where they were on June 2 but I thought the people of Canada made quite a statement .
and companies ?
this double standard is a scandal which every Canadian knows about .
i have begun an initiative to see what might be done in that regard .
together these three pillars ensure that all our eggs are not in the same basket .
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) :
with respect , hon. member , the Chair does not consider that to be a point of order .
some even refer to us as generation x .
these then , are the three great tests that we would propose being applied to this constitutional amendment or any other that comes before this Parliament .
the finance minister , now swabbing the deck at sword point , is saying " No , I don ' t think that is applause '' .
they cut health care funding from $ 19 billion to $ 10.5 billion .
we are getting a little more into debate rather than facts .
it is the practice in Canada that the government does not dictate to the police .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
our community celebrates its individuals ' heritage as well as enjoying the celebration of others .
in fact , they engage in radicalism on the constitutional level , by attempting to provoke all regions of the country .

when one is downtown in the evening going to a movie or to one of our wonderful restaurants there is a sense of vitality and prosperity there that I challenge any other community in Canada to meet .
Mr. Speaker , no amount of wriggling and slithering on this issue is going to get the government off the hook .
in the last Parliament the government had to make some tough decisions .
we should be looking at maximizing the creation of jobs or minimizing unemployment .
he appealed in his talk to section 43 of the Constitution Act 1982 as this would be an appropriate formula for amending the Constitution in the way that Quebec desires .
company money may get to a political party through its employees .
the Speaker :
i am sure many of us will have many discussions with you in the next four years .
i refer the leader of the New Democratic Party to the numbers that came out last week .
Mr. Speaker , I think the hon. member , for whom I have great respect , is being very irresponsible to suggest that there will be an increase in crime .
he told us that he had always been very satisfied with the quality and service of the premises and that he wanted to stay in the building located at 222 , Saint - Georges Street , in downtown Saint - Jer 么 me .
it is clear that this amending formula applies to subsection 93 ( 2 ) of the Constitution , but not to subsections 1 , 3 and 4 .
Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , as we speak , guards at Kingston Penitentiary are on the picket lines .
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) :
this mission will include new entries to the export field and experienced exporters who will perform the important role of mentoring .
however , I think it is ironic that he stands in the House ad nauseam to rave about the excellent public policies in New Zealand when we know that country has experienced some of its own challenges .

Nova Scotia decided the developer would be allowed to charge tolls as a means of recuperating costs directly from the users of the new highway .
so , what will we do as parliamentarians when , before the holiday season - indeed Christmas is coming , but I am confident and also grateful to the government for its diligence - we pass a motion allowing the National Assembly , therefore the people of Quebec , to modernize , thanks to the existing consensus , its school system , so as to have linguistic school boards ?
however , the Liberals are not telling us that the board will not have the mandate to promote investments in our domestic economy .
they have said no to such contacts .

i will remind the House that Mr. Pearson had asked that the Laurendeau - Dunton Commission recommend steps to ensure that the Canadian confederation would develop in accordance with the principle of two equal founding peoples .
he used as an example of his and his party ' s policy the Government of Ontario .
canada HEALTH ACT
while cutting spending , we kept the cuts in transfers to the provinces to a minimum .
the Deputy Speaker :
they have said no , they are not going to get it with this mix - match .
the surpluses that will be generated after the deficit is eliminated should not be used for federalist propaganda , but should go directly to reinstating the transfer payments made to the provinces for social programs .
she asked where he was headed .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
( the House divided on the amendment to the amendment , which was negatived on the following division : )
oh , oh .
commencing next year and for five years the cash portion of the transfer to the provinces will be stabilized at $ 12.5 billion annually , exactly the amount recommended by the National Forum on Health , a blue ribbon panel that spent two years closely examining medicare , its financing and its needs .
therefore the petitioners ask Parliament to amend section 7 of the charter of rights and freedoms to recognize the right of individuals to pursue family life and to recognize the fundamental right and responsibility of parents to direct the upbringing of their children .
Mr. Denis Coderre
this is an opportunity for us in a non - partisan way to share our thoughts and views .
we have , from the facts as they are already known , indicated our concern to the Government of Israel and we have spoken loudly and clearly to the Government of Israel .
of course not , because the Education Act requires us to provide such teaching , and because section 41 of the Quebec charter of rights expressly recognizes such rights .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
criminal CODE
i think I am the only member of Parliament in the room at the moment who was here during that debate .
we think the system must change and we have a plan .
does it have a view on what is the optimal debt size for a government of this nature in this type of a country ?
i suggest to him that really key to the process is that we have a system in which the decisions are made by an independent body whose decisions are subject to judicial review and policy appeal to cabinet .
alas , there is more program mismanagement .
tomorrow in Toronto , I am going to be making an announcement that will make clear the intention of the government with respect to the approach toward herbal remedies and natural products in general .
for those who do not remember , Charles Ponzi was a small time but well known swindler .

the member is confusing it with the reference to debt .
it is the whole debate about partition that is firing up passions in Quebec .
i am now ready to rule on the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Wild Rose on September 30 , 1997 , concerning information allegedly denied to him by an official of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs .
we understand that the government plans for the new measures to be in place by January 1998 , if everything goes well .
we never claimed to be the only ones who speak French in Canada .
national AIDS AWARENESS WEEK
how many young people will be forced into unemployment before this government realizes that the real cause of the crisis is not inflation but the lack of jobs ?
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
it is consistent with investment policies in most public and private pension plans in Canada .
once again it is the same discussion Reform Party members often get into when they talk about spending , that somehow it is gone , ended and never heard from again .
i also met with leaders from the arts community and Women Entrepreneurs of Canada .
* * *
i trust hon. members will forgive me if I engage for a moment in a little nostalgia before turning to the subject matter of the bill .
i wonder if the member could comment on what his definition of economic and fiscal health is .
first , the CWB ' s directors must recommend it .
all together , now .
it is their right and the right of all Canadians to be guaranteed by this government that they will receive access to quality health care under the Canada Health Act .
while our opponents would rather we do nothing and let the program collapse , we are moving forward in a decisive way .
and it is here , on the floor of the House of Commons , that we will have a chance to express our views .
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
it is hoped that this government ' s priorities on justice have been inadvertently forgotten .
the government ' s fondness for spending taxpayers ' money has incited fear that it may impose a carbon tax .
Mr. Speaker , the Liberals want to cut short the debate because they do not want Canadian employers to find out that their payroll taxes are about to jump sky high .
the people who worked in and around it were very important to him .
but we are closely monitoring the situation .

the Deputy Speaker :
" we will give them 10 elected boys but we ' ll control them '' .
however , I believe we are setting the tone for how we are going to work in this Parliament .
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron
Mr. Speaker , I would like to speak briefly in support of this member ' s point of privilege and lay before you two additional pieces of information which may assist you in responding to this .
what does that do to bring us together ?
for 62 years the Canadian Wheat Board has been one of the cornerstones of our nation ' s success in agriculture and agri - food .
i did not make that calculation , I only report it .
in fact , I think it is an expression that I have heard in this House before .
Canadians and young Canadians in particular have no hesitations in asking us to preserve the plan , strengthen its finances , improve its investment practice , and we are doing that .
second , they said that the CPP should remain as a program that is not for redistribution of income but rather universal and available to all .
thousands of Canadians responded and offered their services to meet the Royal Air Force ' s critical shortage of personnel in the radar systems on land and sea and in the air .
they will find the winter a very long one , and I am asking my colleague , if she has a little compassion , to do something for the families of those people , for their children .
this is compared to the current rate of 5.85 percent .
together the CPP and EI premiums will reduce , not create jobs in the country .
madam Speaker , I am going to make a comment and , if he wishes , the member is welcome to pick up on it .
i am not accusing the member of going around asking for votes .
do you wish to raise a point of privilege ?
( the House adjourned at 6.47 p.m. )
i want to assure the House that I intend to continue to contribute and encourage my constituents to actively support these very welcome and timely initiatives .
it is one whereby the federal government works collaboratively with its provincial partners on a specific agenda to make sure that the environment is protected to the highest of standards .

members from across this country in years to come , in particular some of the members on the other side who are a little lighter in age as I am - well , I do have until next week at which point the age of wisdom kicks in - will appreciate that colleagues of their own , friends of theirs and neighbours will be taken care of and the initiatives taken by this government at this time in our lives helped .

any future benefits will be fully funded .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
in the past election they were not as loyal as the Liberals expected them to be , were they ?
therefore , any one government , regardless of the population it represents , can impede the progress of the agreement and of the Canadian economic union .
pardon me for interrupting the minister , but the member for Lac - Saint - Jean has the floor .
Quebec has good legislation on financing .
we would suggest the test of democratic consent has not yet been fully passed .
in any event , today the wheat board legislation is back before the House as Bill C - 4 .

the federal agriculture minister recently , talking about the government ' s fiscal dividend , said that when agriculture producers came forward with ideas he would go to bat for them .
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) :
will there be any disciplinary consequences for the current Minister of Health , or will the government spend another $ 600,000 rehabilitating his image ?
Mr. Speaker , I would first like to indicate that the hon. member has some tremendous shoes to fill in representing the riding of Kings - Hants .
this is an attitude which I have a great deal of difficulty with as I travel throughout my constituency .
i can make a couple of points .
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan
this is not a new concept .
it is my hope the House will recognize the right of all Canadians and support the bill .
this is a very serious problem in this country , one that touches 160,000 Canadians every year .
canada ' s history , tradition and values are being challenged in our courts .
i would however say that it seems to me that the Reform Party just does not get it .
Mr. Dan McTeague
everybody knows that .
[ editor ' s Note :
Mr. Speaker , it is incredible to watch the Liberal damage control machine kick into high gear .
although supporting technology is of primary importance , we must acknowledge there is a need for a healthy environment as well as excellent basic facilities such as skating rinks , parks and community centres .

this proposed approval formula will require the agreement of at least two - thirds of the provinces that have at least 50 percent of the Canadian population .
we have not seen one iota of evidence from this member other than the unsubstantiated allegations that he has put forward .
as we stood at the dikes and watched the raging waters we shared the experience as Canadians .
this is particularly surprising especially because the government has 65 percent of its members from one province .
then there would be agreement .
i think the Prime Minister has a duty to respond .
- privy Council , Vote 15
often our policies and principles are distorted and misrepresented by opponents , but as we grow in maturity and in strength as a party more and more Canadians know the common sense and the solid policy underlying what we are doing as a party .
his consistent advocacy of social legislation to help the old , the sick , the young and the poor , his advocacy in defence of democracy mainly through the development and the improvement of the rules and procedures of the House , his contributions and accomplishments as a social democrat are a monument in themselves and there is little we can do to add to their lustre .
if they serve their constituents and their country well , they will feel the reward of knowing that the country is bit by bit moving positively into the next millennium .

he discovered that the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency had been reporting survey results as actual job creation figures .

the history of the government has been to decrease moneys given to research and development to the tune of approximately $ 700,000 in the last budget .
the Government will play that role in a spirit of openness , pragmatism and innovation .
the Speaker :
provincial jurisdiction together with the fact that the federal transfers to provinces for post - secondary education through the CHST are provided as a block fund means that there is no direct connection between the federal transfers and provincially set tuitions .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
to this end , our government has committed half of future budget surpluses to the reinvestment in strengthening our society , families and communities .
Mr. Speaker , hearing Conservative Senator Pat Carney of British Columbia last week making statements that frustrated provinces should not rule out separation from Canada made me very angry and very upset not only as a Canadian , not only as a parliamentarian , but as a parent who , along with my colleagues , is working diligently to make sure we make this country of ours prosperous , strong and united for us , our children and generations to come .

the government has the ability to seek certain exemptions in respect of social , educational , health , cultural and other areas of concern , such as government procurement , et cetera .
Mr. Speaker , I am also pleased to present seven petitions with the signatures of 178 Canadians from Nova Scotia , Manitoba and British Columbia .
we have a very good dispute settling mechanism within NAFTA and now within the World Trade Organization .
bill C - 2 sends out messages to three groups .
the cuts by the government of Quebec account for 54 percent ; 54 percent of the cuts made are the result of transfer payments which are no longer coming from the federal government as they did in the past .
since then , the slowdown in wage and workforce growth and higher real interest rates have completely changed the circumstances in which the CPP must be financed .
Mr. Speaker , I would suggest it is the ultimate naivety to suggest that every Canadian across the country decided they were going to cast a vote on the basis of one line in the Liberal red book .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
it also refers to the benefits of a national highway system such as job creation , economic development and , most important , the saving of lives and the avoidance of injuries .
of course the House has not been seized of that motion yet , which could come later this day .
canada will march confidently into the 21 st century and the new millennium .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question .
there is an investigation that is taking place .
while the impending zero deficit or balanced budget is indeed good news , I would strongly caution the government that its struggle by no means is over .
in the next section of the paper we talk about responsible spending .
in spite of geography , we have shaped a society that reflects our cultural values as a nation ; tolerance , understanding , recognition of the vital role that two languages , generosity of spirit and respect for the individual .
when will this Liberal government stop wasting the taxpayers ' money for petty politics and start assuming its responsibility to deal with the crisis of youth unemployment ?
the CPP is going to have $ 10 billion annually by the year 2003 .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to start by congratulating the member on what I believe is his first speech in the House .
Mr. Myron Thompson
these unprecedented natural disasters led to the greatest expression of generosity and solidarity modern - day Canada has ever known .
Mr. Speaker , it is very clear from the minister ' s reply that he is not in the least concerned about the plight of seasonal and other workers entering the job market .
hon. members know more about the last amendment we had before the House .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
however , Quebecers are nobody ' s fool .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I would like to begin my speech by thanking the voters of the Churchill riding for their support .
my question to the Minister of Finance is about demographic skulduggery .
i might mention that we shared chairs on the justice committee and travelled all across the country looking at the Young Offenders Act .
i have the honour to report that , the House having attended on His Excellency the Governor General in the Senate chamber , I informed His Excellency that the choice of Speaker had fallen upon me .
the struggle against the deficit was not undertaken so that we could celebrate our accounting accomplishments .
Mr. Speaker , on Monday I asked the President of the Treasury Board whether one or more employees in his office had given confidential information to Pierre Gobeil , who is currently under investigation by the RCMP .
Mr. Speaker , many members have spoken recently on the subject of breast cancer , a devastating disease that has become the leading cause of death among women 35 to 55 years of age .
Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , in January the justice minister at the time swore that the government would never pay Mulroney ' s legal team a cent .
how is it physically done ?
i am confident that by working together and by pooling our resources and by committing to nothing less than success we will overcome this challenge .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the question from my friend on the opposite side of the House .
if the minister of heritage had lost her election and lived until 75 , she would have collected $ 2.8 million .
it is not appropriate for the Solicitor General of Canada to be involved in an investigation by the RCMP .
before the next member commences , I would remind hon. members that they must be at their seats to be recognized by the Chair .
my interest extends to the work I did in committee last year .
Mr. Speaker , the concept of equality and the word equality is what is important .
it seems to me it is the Bloc Quebecois that refuses to accept the democratic will of the people of Quebec by continually ignoring the results of two referenda , going back and going back until it hopes it will eventually get the answer it would like to get .
this means that Canada pension plan funds will be invested in stocks , bonds including provincial bonds , and mortgages .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz
we believe it is very vital that all seniors have pensionable earnings .
Mr. Robert D . Nault :

introduction OF PUBLIC BILLS IN SENATE
to the hon. member who has brought orange juice into the House , would you please -
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy
we managed the situation in this country quite differently and we are fiscally responsible and we corrected the mess their administration had made .
there are just as many regulations meant to protect as there are to interfere .
we know that in order to deal with the problems of the plan , the government is raising the premiums by an astounding 73 % , the largest tax hike in Canadian history , a $ 10 billion tax hike by the final year that the new premiums go into effect .
however there is a third area of concern to us in which the minister has made no concession and that is in the area of cash purchases of grain .
it is a fact that not only do more men than women have workplace pensions , they also have more in those pensions .
my riding of St. Catharines is known as the garden city .
we would also make provisions to finance the extra cost per year of seniors benefits resulting from demographic change .
what better occasion to gather with one ' s family and friends to reflect on the old year and the new .
my simple and direct question to the Prime Minister , who likes clear questions , is as follows :
i find it shameful for a government to take between $ 6 billion and $ 9 billion a year out of the employment insurance surplus to finance the deficit reduction effort .
this place has lost its democratic reason to exist .
what would happen to all these poor pensioners if they had been involved in Bre - X ?
i would like to see the private member ' s bill I am sure the member will propose .
if the hon. member will take a look at what we did in previous budgets he will see very clearly that we have begun the process of tax relief , is a welcome change I must say after 10 years of tax increases from the Tories .
in addition , it requires the publishing at least three months before the start of each fiscal year of a complete budget policy statement using standard accounting practices so that all the obligations of government are listed .
thus , it will become once again a model at the international level , with which a sovereign Quebec will be able to build a real partnership .
my constituents will benefit from this initiative and I am proud to be part of the team that believes that our criminal justice system and the safety of Canadians deserve attention and action .
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
i want to tell the prime minister that I will not put up or shut up until the prime minister coughs up whose offices - cabinet ministers , MPs , the prime minister or any departmental official - have been raided by the RCMP in this ongoing Shawinigan shemozzle .
bill C - 4 contains a good 60 references to the minister .
in his annual report , released two days ago , the commissioner reiterated his concerns about document tampering by public servants and renewed his call for the creation of penalties for those actions .
we argue very strongly that it is time we had balanced budget legislation .
i believe the economy will be in better shape than that , as do many economists .
in the years to come , our government will be spending $ 800 million to stimulate youth employment .
i cannot resist the temptation to put , through you , a question to our colleague , who is from Montreal and represents a constituency similar to mine in that there are very specific concerns about Montreal .
by treating the problem we can begin to break some of the cycles that served to frustrate the youth of this country .
our diverse ethnic make - up must continue to be our social strength that nurtures our tolerance and compassion and does not serve the cause of disunity .
that must and will be the yardstick by which we measure progress and by which we are judged .
that assures nations like ours the opportunity of equal treatment with larger trading partners .
i would also ask for the help of the ministers to keep their responses shorter .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :

in respecting the process - I have said this to him and I will repeat - it would be inappropriate for me to comment on a matter before a quasi - judicial board .

there can be no links between the religious beliefs and convictions of individuals and the way we will , or want to , set up school boards .
Mr. Speaker , on a point of order .
Monday , September 29 , 1997
perhaps the hon. member could elaborate for just a few seconds since we do not have much time on the injustice being done to so many women in the public service , by virtue of this government ' s persistent refusal to take seriously the judgment of its own human rights tribunal and pay what is due to women in the public service as a result of that judgment having been made with respect to pay equity .
bill C - 222 .
for some months now , Quebec ' s asbestos industry has been threatened by the prohibition imposed on this product by France .
the Speaker :
we must develop better solutions in assisting students with the critical transition from school to work .
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
the member for Rouyn - Noranda is right .
we must strive to address both the long and short term requirements of society .
the Liberal approach to putting our fiscal house in order is totally unacceptable .

Mr. Speaker , I wish to offer my congratulations on your speakership once again and to all those who will be occupying the chair .
can the Minister of Industry indicate how the government intends to go about this ?
Mr. Paul Szabo
Mr. Speaker , the response today in the House by the Minister of Health regarding the serious issue of this government accessing the personal and confidential files of Dr. Mich 猫 le Brill - Edwards is unbelievably irresponsible and speaks to his own decision this summer to cut the drug and food labs in the health protection branch .
heaven knows he has teed off plenty of voters .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
the Minister of Heritage will need to find ways of supporting the periodicals and scientific and cultural periodicals which are being seriously threatened by the reduced postal subsidy and the changes in its rules .
and now , on to the work of this Parliament .
all those opposed will please say nay .
Mr. Speaker , it is true that we voted against the motion because we have a great belief in national programs .
i could not put it more eloquently and I terminate on that .
access TO INFORMATION
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi ( Bramalea - Gore - Malton , Lib . ) :
i will reserve my decision until I and you hear what the minister would have to add to this particular case .
the day before last , the Auditor General of Canada gave the example of a department that achieved a 40 % saving by systematically going out to public tender .
within that plan there will be solutions for Sydney , for the Cape Breton Island , for Windsor , for Tecumseh , for St. Clair Beach .
the Speaker :
i should point out that there have already been two studies done and I believe the auditor general will comment as well .
it is my duty to inform the House that the Speaker of this House has been duly elected .
the Government is committed to work with other governments , the private sector , communities and individual Canadians to help equip young people for the future .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
it is a good structure because it represents the needs of the people who are most interested in the Canadian Wheat Board .
we cannot forget seniors benefits .
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
it must be said , however , that Quebec too is intending to do likewise for the same reasons of good management .

Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for his speech and I understand his wanting to express his pride .

i caution the hon. member to get the facts before he characterizes conduct in that irresponsible way .
* * *
as I stand here today I pledge that I will do my best to put a new face on politics .
that is why we are in favour of immediately making changes to the plan by , first , increasing premiums because fuller funding is required right away to build a fund out of which pensions can be paid to those who will come after us .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
perhaps he did not read our platform .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :

Mr. Speaker , our government , together with the Quebec Community Futures Development Corporations , has launched an important program with an initial budget of six million dollars , aimed at people 35 years old and younger in communities served by all 54 CFDCs .
this agreement must come before the treaty is signed , not after .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
we invite informed discussion from all Canadians on the future direction of this country .
Mr. Speaker , there is a broad range of issues in the question on which we could have quite a long discussion .
but when the opposition parties rant and rave about this hopelessly inadequate Canada pension plan I think they should sharpen their pencils .
however , I agree that we have to decide on a course of action quickly .

RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
in that situation , nobody will be surprised that the government cannot muster enough political will to act when asked to fix the tax loopholes which allowed family trusts to transfer $ 2 billion in the United States without paying taxes .
madam Speaker , I can relate to the business that the hon. member mentioned .
one of the things this report mentions is an overall lack of funding - cuts of $ 84 million do not go unnoticed in a budget - as well as shortcomings in marketing , and distribution problems .
deductions for the Canada pension plan are either currently being paid to beneficiaries or invested in a fund .
one in five Canadian children lives in poverty .
we could honour his memory better by introducing progressive changes like affordable tuition , a decent pension plan and a fair and equitable tax system .

Ms. Jocelyne Bujold Girard ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :

so brief was this mention that it failed to even hint at the prime minister ' s intentions regarding a legally binding greenhouse emissions cap .
the manpower agreement , for instance , is an example of our government ' s desire for a modern federalism .
the Speaker :
the stench of corruption that now hangs over this government is something which we have to deal with in a very timely and effective manner .
there are many of us out there and no facilities to accommodate the need .
- the government will bring frankness and clarity to any debate that puts into question the future existence or unity of Canada .
parliament opens appropriately as another glorious Canadian summer comes to its end .
Mr. Michel Gauthier
i would like to ask the member a very direct question .
if the minister would like to answer the preamble he is welcome to .
the federal , provincial and territorial governments will act to address this problem , and First Ministers and territorial leaders will be working on this issue when they meet this fall .

Mr. Speaker , the Governor of the Bank of Canada says he is going to continue to raise interest rates , but now the CIBC says that he is choking off the potential for job creation .
this could set a significant precedent because if this amendment is passed without Ontario ' s consent now , will Quebec separatists use this to further their argument that they can unilaterally alter the Canadian Constitution without the consent of their partners in Confederation ?
they dislike seeing our tax dollars foolishly spent or abused .

miss Deborah Grey
i have been listening to what has been said .
with the support of this House , we will meet our responsibility to Canadians to make sure that the Canada pension plan will be here for them when they need it .
governments in Quebec and the other provinces are made to look like heavies , because they have been forced to make cuts and not Ottawa , which in turn steps in as a saviour using the money it took from workers and the neediest and reinvesting mere crumbs in areas which are not even under its jurisdiction , namely social programs , education and once again health care .

how is it his own government made such a strange decision ?
Mr. Speaker , this is one time I really regret not having an opportunity to ask a question of the previous speaker , the member for Calgary Southeast , rather than having a 10 - minute speech .
is it simply that the government does not know what is going on , or is there something about this that makes the government reluctant to share what it knows with this House ?

Mr. Speaker , if that is so , why did the minister deny the allegations made at that hearing ?
however , the Speech from the Throne makes no mention of the promise of the second red book to create a $ 15 million multimedia fund and fails to act on the recommendation of the advisory committee on the information highway that a $ 50 million , and not $ 15 million , fund be set up .

rather than pursuing some far off larger international consensus that might have included also holdout superpowers at the price however of open - ended exemptions or delays or special geographical regional exceptions , our foreign minister has preferred to move now on behalf of a clear and unequivocal treaty text that really does have some teeth in it .

the Deputy Speaker :
where the debate goes off track is when some of our colleagues assume that the only measure of how we treat these citizens is how much money the government spends to deal with them .
i was interested in the comments which the member made regarding aboriginal people .
Canadians believe and I believe the money should have gone into health care transfers .
yet they fought us every inch of the way .
does he agree with that ?
i was among those who congratulated the member for Madawaska - Restigouche , first for defeating the former Minister of Human Resources Development during the last election - which is a praiseworthy accomplishment in itself - but also for his speeches on employment insurance .
would the minister support measures such as converting the child care deduction into a refundable credit available to all families ?
i was very pleased that the leader of our party in talking about the motion that was before the House yesterday tried in his amendment to preserve those rights .
it will affect every working Canadian , especially our children and our grandchildren .
in his 20 minute speech , he raised a few points which may be worth looking at again .

are we going to have national exams in that sector ?
perhaps that is where they have been getting these suggestions from .
members on that side who still think an $ 8,800 a year pension is good news should give their heads a shake because it is totally ridiculous .
Mr. Gary Pillitteri ( Niagara Falls , Lib . ) :
did they get a national consensus ?
there is no cure for arthritis , and the direct and indirect costs of this disease are enormous .
that is what this Speech from the Throne tries to do .
Mr. Dennis J . Mills :

Mr. Joe Jordan

the member then suggested that when people get jobs all they do is spend the money , suggesting that somehow spending money is a bad thing .

madam Speaker , what is nice about my being here today is that I seem to keep certain members of the Bloc Quebecois awake .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday I attended an event marking a tragic day in our country ' s history .
we want to give credit where credit is due .
there should be no talk of " we the people of Quebec '' , because I am one of the people of Quebec and because 62 percent of the people of Quebec voted for a federalist party in the last election .
new Democrats hold the Liberal government accountable for not maintaining our social safety net and ask it to now assume its responsibility for all of those in our community .
let me illustrate .
it is a basic fundamental issue that is the business of this House .
will he immediately grant the flexibility that he and the former minister had promised so that British Columbia salmon fishermen can achieve financial viability with their enterprises ?
referral to committee prior to second reading allows members opposite and government members to provide greater input into the substance and structure of a bill .
the first is that Canadians increasingly understand personal income taxes in Canada are unjustly high .
i am particularly encouraged by the government statement on national unity .
* * *
it is saying that there is new money , that the promised land has arrived , that happy days are back again .
we have said let us work now to increase the transfer payments to provinces at least to $ 15 billion .
more recently , in an interview with the daily Le Droit , the Bloc Quebecois critic on official languages said that the Bloc would always defend francophones outside Quebec .
by acting in the same way a small business or family would by paring back the non - essentials , by cutting ?
it was quite interesting .
it was set up as a pay as you go system rather than somebody ' s individual earnings and payments going into the plan to look after them in their retirement .
today an elected Senate is possible without constitutional change .
they could have congratulated one another for standing up unanimously in support of a program that will be good for young Canadians today , tomorrow and for a long time .
Mr. Speaker , Algeria has been a site of bloody conflict for years now , and the situation has been deteriorating rapidly in recent months .
interparliamentary DELEGATIONS
Mr. Speaker , many of the problems being experienced with the British Columbia salmon fishery have been caused by the present minister of fisheries and this government .
we have recognized that children must get a good start in life , be it through proper nutrition or through proper education .
again , this is the right wing politics of the Reform Party .
in the House of Commons Mr. Ellis was an advocate for the less well off in society , in particular in the areas of housing and health care , helping to form the caring society that Canada has become , a tradition that all of us from Regina would aspire to continue .
but let me tell the House it is not .
i have not heard any opposition member tells us how they would do it .
it provides a plan for investing in our future , a future that reflects Canadians ' determination to build a society based on fairness and equality .
is that agreed ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
our second largest trading partner , Japan , has an unemployment rate at a third of that level .
* * *
the Speaker :
if the hon. member wants to make allegations , if he has new facts to disclose - because that concerns me as much as it concerns all of us as members of Parliament - he should tell the RCMP , which , according to the news release , is conducting an investigation at the request of the human resources minister .
i have heard her party time and time again talk about the need to transfer powers to the provinces .
that Mr. Peter Milliken , member for the electoral district of Kingston and the Islands , be appointed Deputy Speaker and chairman of the committees of the whole House .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion : - if ever the Calgary declaration were to become an interpretive clause , which is possible , although it has not happened yet , of course , as it is under discussion , the interpretation given would guarantee Quebecers that the courts would take into account today ' s unique , as opposed to yesterday ' s distinct , character of Quebec society .
we want to criticize the features of the speech which we consider inadequate .
the TAGS program was supposed to help lift up Atlantic fishermen after the collapse of the fishery .
furthermore , we will be here in the coming years to remind him of the past and present realities of Quebec and of its aspirations .
i noticed one urban news reporter complaining the other day that Bill C - 4 had " suddenly " been introduced in the House .
if he is making use of a modern method of consultation , that ' s fine .
how does the member expect to understand what British Columbians are thinking when he does not even listen to what they are saying ?
i would like to point out to the House that the national interest is precisely the third criterion on which we should judge constitutional amendments .
Mr. Speaker , mere weeks before the election was called this spring , millions of dollars from this transitional jobs fund were funnelled into the Prime Minister ' s own riding .
canada is a trading nation .
i would also like to congratulate the other 300 MPs who were elected to Parliament on June 2 which will bring a wide divergence of opinion in this place and across the land .
as such , I have often looked at Quebec very favourably .
Ms. Alexa McDonough
the petitioners and I support a call on Parliament to urge the federal government to join the provincial governments to make the national highway system upgrading possible .
madam Speaker , I knew you would be impartial .
without resources this Parliament would not be here .
i do not know where the parliamentary secretary gets the nerve to think he could get away with this .
the government only included a few paragraphs to affirm its supposedly crucial role in that area .
i have also pledged to my constituents that I will fight for a strong , influential department of agriculture .
miss Deborah Grey
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy
she is obviously expounding their super RRSP program .
i was in the House when we did that .
we have not sought to get any kind of permission from the people who hold those sacred rights .
they have said very clearly to fix the Canada pension plan , ensure that it is sustainable and ensure that you do not gut the benefits at all costs .
employment
we have taken significant action to protect the integrity of our passports and the safety of Canadians .
Mr. Preston Manning
it is home to many of Canada ' s First Nations peoples as well as home to many new Canadians who find in east Vancouver a balance of Canadian roots and multicultural diversity .

some hon. members :
some hon. members :
they voted for me in the majority because they felt the work I was doing was important to them and to our country .
as my colleague mentioned , we had two very significant natural disasters in Canada although we had several others in other parts of the country .
the annual interest bill would be enough to run each and every hospital in Canada for two years .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
successive federal governments have mismanaged our most important resource in Atlantic Canada , our fishery .
the Deputy Speaker :
that was enough to get the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs into a panic .
as I was saying , our Liberal Party colleague referred earlier to the two referendums which were held .
how can we create jobs if the federal government takes them away ?
i think it is wrong .
my answer , my answer to my Canadian friends , lies in a poem of Gilles Vigneault who in his Balises wrote , and so I conclude in French :
they are probably disappointed that the government has not paid more attention to it in the throne speech , which allegedly is the vision that the government lays out for the next few years .
Mr. Speaker , it is with great intent that some of my colleagues are discussing Bill C - 2 respecting changes to the Canada pension plan board .
this minister does talk a great deal about children and families , which is nice to hear .
does she agree with that position ?
farming is important to our part of Ontario .
with this $ 23 billion , the federal government is making taxpayers pay for its deficit reduction efforts in a sneaky , underhand , roundabout way .
the next question is on the main motion .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and ordered to be printed )
the Deputy Speaker
many of them will attend school the next day and boast about their exploits .
we have an obligation to build a stronger Canada .
that is what I thought it was initially set up for .
four of the fifteen members and the CEO will be appointed .
i think it was confirmed yesterday by the Prime Minister ' s office that he was generally informed of the allegations but not of the investigation as such .
our friends across the way have got it all worked out to fool the public .
however , I wonder how he can be proud since , although the Speech from the Throne focuses on young people , it is the policies of this government since 1993 that have forced a significant number of young people into poverty .
if my friends opposite were sincere about helping young people afford post - secondary education , they would go far beyond having a scholarship program .
since producers are the backbone of this industry it is they who have been disregarded by this government .
Mr. Andrew Telegdi :
six seats have been added to reflect the increasing number of Canadian electors .
bank OF CANADA
it is wrong .
i want to get to the substance of this debate .
we know we must improve opportunities for aboriginal communities .
i will certainly try to do even better in the 36 th .
they voted themselves some tax increases for repairs to the community as well as voted against some other things .
it has to do with the subject of ultimate accountability .
i request that you consider this issue in the context of - because I do not think it has been very well expressed - members ' privileges under the Privacy Act .
reform of the Canada pension plan was put in place by the federal government with agreement from the provincial governments .
securing Canada ' s retirement income system is a priority .
Mr. Speaker , I will use my example of Wales another time .
privilege
as the prime minister said , our children are our most precious resource .
i would also like to congratulate the members for Parkdale - High Park and for Beauce on their excellent speeches .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Mr. Speaker , my party is profoundly disappointed with the lack of vision demonstrated by the government with Bill C - 2 .
i will refrain from saying what happens , as history teaches us , when ethnic grouping is encouraged on a territorial basis .
when people outside the north think of the Arctic , they think of igloos , polar bears , and arts and crafts .
they wanted an assured benefit when they reach retirement age .
Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
in other words , if the market has all the power then all we can really be is a consumer .
what she wants - and this is for the member of the Reform Party to understand - is for workers to work as low as possible with fewer health standards and lower working standards than anywhere else in Canada .
we have to present them in the House .
government ORDERS
gun LEGISLATION
and the bells having rung :
maybe they should travel to Atlantic Canada .
it is going to mean dealing with -
this government is not moving forward and is pushing Canadians back to a period of tax and spend liberalism .
that accountability can come with a chief executive officer who is appointed by an elected board , and with the elected board .
this is his first term here .
the third scenario was that we look at some combination of the two .
the member wants us to mail a letter tomorrow .
it is also true that with the hundreds of different organizations involved in the fishing industry there are hundreds of different ideas of what should happen to cure the ills affecting the industry .
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Kitchener - Waterloo , Lib . ) :
the first is to increase funding of the system , to take it from two to five years , as proposed by the minister .
that is a reallocation of taxes from the wealthy to the middle class .
let me give an example .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te
the Speaker :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i heard the parliamentary secretary raise a number of straw men that he proceeded to knock down , which is not that difficult to do .
in short it would put the town back in the unity town halls .
i hope my colleague from Abitibi , who is from the same area as I am , agrees with me and is going to condemn this practice by a Liberal Party organizer named Pierre Corbeil .
i do not understand why a country like Canada which has benefited so much from its diversity of cultures and languages would even discuss a change which could weaken the partners of a country that is such a global success story .
but members can imagine how proud I am as the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development that in the Speech from the Throne we also identify the priorities that Canadians put on aboriginal peoples .
although the architects of the CPP did not end up in jail , the poor design of the plan is glaringly obvious .
they are united for principles that Canadians support from British Columbia to Newfoundland .
they are starting their own businesses , or perhaps they are doing voluntary community work .
* * *
i am a little overwhelmed at the idea of participating so directly in one of Canada ' s most important institution .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
the hon. member for Calgary - Nose Hill and other of our colleagues will be advancing some new principles and ideas for real social reform in the days ahead .
there are investments in our future , in our children that this government needs to make .
we established a national volunteer screening system to help organizations screen out child sexual abusers who apply to work with children .
it is time to show that politicians can bring truth , integrity , compassion and indeed honour to the profession .
the Speaker :
they are tied together as political parties on the basis of principle .
the following was part of the answer was :
at present the CPP has a fund equal to about two years of benefits .
government ORDERS
the voters clearly preferred our more responsible approach and saw through the Reform Party ' s irresponsible tax cut promises before the budget was balanced .
the health minister has been inundated by letters on this issue .
bill C - 240 .
after three and a half years , it has been forced , by a large deficit , to retract its promises and to adopt the Reform Party platform , just as the Trudeau government borrowed from the NDP platform in order to stay in power .
Mr. Monte Solberg
the Speaker :
points OF ORDER
they have also been forced to make a tremendous sacrifice because of previous Liberal - Tory overspending .
if we had been writing the speech from the throne and wanted to demonstrate to Canadians that we had some substances behind our unity proposals , what would have been in our legislative package that might have sent that signal ?
the Deputy Speaker :
my task is to see to it that the rights and privileges of all of you parliamentarians of Canada are protected .
it also begs the question that if the prime minister has the power to appoint senators should he not have the power to dismiss senators .
oh , oh .
events in recent months have shown that working conditions for employees in federal detention centres in Quebec are extremely dangerous .
in the G - 7 Canada is the highest taxed as a percentage of personal income tax to GDP of any country , by far .
the indemnification clause bothers us .
the Government will contribute to this goal with an agenda to promote good health .
i will always remember that the first thing I was asked to do when I arrived in Ottawa was to vote rather than having a decision imposed on me from above , which had been my experience in the past .
hon. David M Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Lafontaine became the francophone Catholic member for a thoroughly English and Protestant riding .
children
first , they want to measure the academic readiness of our children .
i appeal to all hon. members that when situations such as this arise we should always remember that we are the members of the House , representative of all Canadians .
but open participation in competent , transparent processes with clear evaluation mechanisms is the key to Canada ' s continued success on the world stage .
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay
it has the barest of majorities right now .
every year , more than 300,000 Canadians learn French , in a country that should be proud of its two languages and two cultures .
this government said it would continue to address the problem of foreign overfishing .
Mr. John Harvard ( Charleswood - Assiniboine , Lib . ) :
they say we have not consulted , but without consulting they have presented tax cuts which they feel are so important .
Canadian Club is an agri - food product and is also a great symbol of our country in my view .
* * *
we simply reply to that by saying that was then and this is now .
if Mr. Amerasinghe had justification for his attack on Judge Jerome , the proper body to take it before was the Judicial Council of Canada , instead of sowing seeds of contempt in the minds of his superiors within the Department of Justice and yet that is exactly what he did .
i would argue that the government has done a very poor job in terms of getting its spending priorities in place .
my riding seems rather like Simcoe - Grey , with a number of farmers and many unemployed people .
those who say that the CPP is a tax grab either do not understand economics or they do not understand tax .
they want to talk about party financing ?
they hear the rabble upstairs , they hear all the noise and they are very concerned because they too can hear the din .
the Deputy Speaker :
( the House adjourned at 4.36 p.m. )
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
the last time the government raised the CPP tax it squandered pension funds in provincial bonds at below market rates .
i would like to expand on three themes we find in the throne speech : social reform , economic reform and national unity .
i also thank the people of Longueuil who voted for the youngest woman in this Parliament .
if five individuals brought this to the minister ' s attention , it means there are many others who coughed up large amounts .
they are probably counter to NAFTA .
introduction and first reading
some were only short by a few hours .
young people , normally full of hope , fear the future holds nothing but disappointment , chronic unemployment and debt .
Mr. Michel Gauthier
madam Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
( 1 ) to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development
i would invite him to stick to the rules in this regard and give us a summary of the petition rather than read the entire petition to the House .
i would like to recognize the contribution of Hybrid Turkeys to Kitchener .
first , when we are talking about 38,000 individuals , these are not illegal immigrants but people who are seeking refugee status .
i fear , however , that Quebecers will once again in the near future be asked to decide whether they wish to remain in Canada .
the only way we can find that out is to ask the people where they think a surplus should be spent once we have a balanced budget and there is extra money in the treasury .
my colleague is absolutely right .
i represent a large number of seniors .
that the Committee be empowered to authorize television and radio broadcasting of any or all of its proceedings ;
hon. Alfonso Gagliano
first , it places on their shoulders most of the burden for paying for the disastrously poor design and past mismanagement of the plan .
human RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
hon. Fred Mifflin
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
UI premiums are job killers .
Mr. Speaker , we are into a full blown debate on the issue now .
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
i wondered how that could be .
it is either pay into the plan and pay the benefits , or do not pay into the plan and cut the whole CPP .
the petitioners pray and request that Parliament amend the Criminal Code of Canada to set the age of consent at 18 years of age to provide protection from exploitation and abuse .
at the time I was only eight months old .
this example also serves to point out the kind of narrow anti - government argument Reform members are prepared to engage in rather than the substantive of where should government be involved in bettering the lives and prospects of our children .
we on this side of the House heard the message of the last election .
as of September 10 , the minister had only received an acknowledgement of receipt of her letter .
my hon. friends across the way have tried to scare people , which is their typical way of dealing with these things , by suggesting the Reform Party plan is something radically new .
if one multiplies that by the $ 50,000 a year of wealth generated by each of those individuals , we have a figure of $ 12.5 billion that Waterloo region adds to the Canadian economy each year by the virtue of higher education .
citizens worry about whether they will have access to the highest possible quality of health care when they need it .
it has been like a litany of transferring of powers over the last many years .
many members know , if they have talked to young people , how cheated young people feel by what is being proposed in this legislation .
by definition those are some very significant funds .
the poor , the disabled , the children , the aged and the ill are all bearing the brunt of less money , less commitment to such things as public health , public education and the whole concept of community .
nay .
that is something for which those who sit on the front bench of government , none of whom represent people of my generation , should apologize to my generation .
we must never forget that there are French Canadians outside Quebec .
it should be an electable offence .
when historians write about the 1997 election I think this is one of the things they will single out .
we have seen how that could help in consultations on certain declarations , because a number of provinces are contemplating using the connection from Industry Canada .
Nunavut has many international borders including Russia , Denmark and the United States .
to his credit Clyde Wells at least made some provision for those classes of people who wanted to retain their rights in education .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
i want to point out to the hon. member that in spite of the fact that we complain about some societies being less tolerant than others , the overall average score even for the least tolerant in our communities in Canada is still almost close to five , with five being the most tolerant of all .
the Federal Office of Regional Development for Quebec decided to contribute $ 990,000 to a local initiative for the creation of the Saint - Hubert military base and airport area corporation .
to conclude , I want to reaffirm my solemn commitment to represent my constituents to the best of my abilities and to co - operate with all members of this House to ensure our government reflects and is sensitive to the needs of all Canadians .
an hon. member :
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
as members know , unemployment has been one of the problems facing not only this government but governments around the world .
first of all , Mr. Speaker , let me assure the member from Thunder Bay that he will never ever find a Reformer kissing a Tory .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
those producers are crying out for fundamental change and some freedom to choose .
we did not take this role on to stand back and not deal with it until we are at a critical stage .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy
the Liberal pyromaniac turns into a firefighter , and then uses the neighbour ' s well to extinguish the fire he has started .
after the last election , we find ourselves in a fragmented Parliament , a Parliament reflecting the true face of Canada .

Mr. Grant Hill
three factors make a significant difference to young people getting started in the world of work - a good education , a chance at a first job , and a mentor to work with as they establish themselves .
people of the North Shore -
however , I would like to hear it from this hon. member ' s lips .
i am not sure what the qualifications for personal needs would be to go work for FedEx during the time they are unpaid .
we will get back to the member with detailed information .
first , thank God he is not the Minister of Finance .
at one point in the meeting I was asked to leave by Mr. Jobin because he claimed that I was not entitled to certain information that he offered to the citizens attending .
if this is the case , can the Prime Minister assure this House that this investigation will not be delayed or interfered with in any way , and that if any members of his Cabinet are involved in any way , he will take the necessary steps to relieve them of their duties until it is completed ?
there was not too much heckling .
this is somewhat surprising since in the Airbus case , which came to its conclusion this week , the then justice minister told us that , in such cases , the Solicitor General , not the Prime Minister , had to be informed first .
it must be that the oft - repeated words of the Quebec premier are finally finding an echo in English Canada .

Mr. David Chatters

it will undoubtedly hold the key to reducing child poverty and aboriginal isolation in Canada .
we intend to increase the federal government ' s contribution to the child tax credit by at least $ 850 million over the course of this mandate .

what I would suggest is what we have done in our party .
instead we will have to watch and live vicariously through others .
Ms. Marlene Catterall :

it concluded that over 35 years of regional development programs have led to huge economic distortions .
Mr. Speaker , the minister responsible for the solicitor general ' s department has admitted to approving wide - ranging Canadian Security Intelligence Service wiretap warrants , allowing CSIS investigators to conduct electronic surveillance on Canadian and foreign nationals not named in the warrant .
one knows of the debate that was occurring only moments ago in the House .
the ceasefire called for recently by the Islamic Salvation Army did not materialize .
this has not been talked about .
yesterday , the Minister of Transport once again invoked the work in progress at Dorval as an excuse to maintain an RCMP presence in international airports in Quebec , contrary to the practice elsewhere in Canada .
hon. Andy Scott
i think we have struck a very reasonable balance .
Mr. Pierre Brien
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) :
members
but the government has always had access to that account and could play this sort of shell game where it pays off a bit of the debt and then borrows the money back again .
unfortunately the Liberal government chose to ignore other parts of the Calgary declaration , which recognize the equality of citizens and provinces .
first , with regard to the tabling of the document , I will accept as a submission to myself so I can look at the document , the draft I believe the hon. member called it .
i hope the government will do something to right that wrong .
Toronto now replaces Montreal in size and Vancouver may in turn in the future given its present growth rate .

the result is that tuition fees are going through the roof and nobody in their right mind is going to come out of university with a $ 35,000 or $ 40,000 bill for his or her education and say " Sure , I will pay that off and then I will be glad to help you with your pension '' .

Mr. Paul Bonwick
Nova Scotia has a great competitive advantage in this regard and would be hurt by this government if it superimposes partisan politics on Nova Scotia trade matters .

i would also like to thank the new member for Simcoe - Grey .
a Speaker in 1978 ruled a matter to be prima facie case of contempt where the RCMP were alleged to have deliberately misled a minister of the crown and the member for Northumberland - Durham resulting in " an attempt to obstruct the House by offering misleading information '' .
i would ask him to restrain himself .
he talked to social planners , seniors , youth and the disabled to make certain that all the elements of society that are affected by the Canada pension plan were taken into account .
today I am reintroducing the people ' s tax form act which will give all taxpayers the opportunity to tell the government what they think by voluntarily filling out a form which would be included with each tax kit distributed by Revenue Canada .

i will bring it down to one quote which I think is very important .
Mr. Chuck Strahl
the new program which Quebec intends to implement as of next year will provide for a standard amount of $ 2,500 , regardless of the contributor .
rather than investing in the future , the government has opened the floodgates to social disaster .
agreed .
it was completely unacceptable for the government to forgo any real consideration of the last constitutional amendment that came its way .
if the provincial government fails to do so , the Government of Canada should make a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada on that point .
agreed .
the proposal by the Reform Party would certainly make a lot of stockbrokers , investment advisers and retirement planners very rich and wealthy , but I am wondering what it would do for Canadians .
the only person who can come up with that is the Prime Minister of the country .
our third priority , therefore , is to promote national unity and it is also why we have picked the right way to go about it : deliver good , flexible , honest and effective government to all Canadians , government that stays the course during hard times , government that manages the public purse wisely and works to eliminate the deficit and the debt .
it is all the more relevant in the current context , given the influence peddling allegations involving employees of the Liberal Party of Canada and of the government .

Mr. Speaker , to the contrary , the Department of Transport is very vigorous in applying safety standards .
this was only made public five days after the election campaign was over .
is it mentioned ?
it is indeed unfortunate that the previous government did not understand this concept .
in fact he alleges that the revenue department has knowingly allowed over a million shipments of commercial cargo to escape customs control .
accordingly , the House stands adjourned until tomorrow .
madam Speaker , passage of this bill would force political parties to raise all the money they need from the people they purport to represent , instead of gaining money by compulsion from taxpayers through the election rebate system .
as a government we were very proud that one of the major new initiatives of this government as it relates to creating safe communities and safe homes is in the area of crime prevention .

Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
this gives them that opportunity .

the member argues that he had such consent .
some hon. members :
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
members and senators , however , on the joint committee will want to satisfy themselves that this is in fact the case .
Mr. Denis Coderre
our government will continue to focus resources wisely in key areas of the economy creating a better environment for our children and ensuring that our health care and public pension systems continue to be among our country ' s greatest assets .
i want to say one more thing and then I will let the member respond .
i would encourage the Prime Minister to continue his trade missions and to continue to invite businessmen and women from Windsor , Tecumseh and St. Clair Beach to join him as he promotes Canada around the world .
there are a whole slew of examples even in the Hill Times and many of these examples find their way into the mainstream press .

Mr. Daniel Turp :
Mr. Monte Solberg :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism .
private trade missions should be encouraged .
Mr. Speaker , the finance minister ' s massive CPP rip - off is a little bit like a dead fish .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
now the federal government is down to 10 % cash donations for transfer payments and it is falling fast .

learned parliamentarians on all sides of the House supported a law which should not have been supported .
even within Quebec its vote is regionalized primarily in the area east of Montreal .
we have trouble hearing the speeches .
Mr. Speaker , I do not think it was an error for the government to help fishermen who were in a very difficult situation because of problems in the fishery .
they have broken their word .
Mr. Randy White
he saw government as something that could play a positive role in the economy and in the creation of social programs .
what I do know is that the Reform Party ' s proposal to have a referendum on this question is without merit .
hon. Anne McLellan
( official Version )
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal
i remind all hon. members , with respect , that last week a question of privilege was brought up to which I will address myself in the next short while .
that is the kind of trick I will use to remember the name of his riding in future .
as we know and as we have experienced in Ontario , this leaves those less able to , to go and fend for themselves .
let me also say that I am sharing my time with the hon. member for St. Catharines .
Ms. Marlene Jennings
if they did say it , however , I totally disagree with their position .
some American companies have been bought out because they have been very successful in the mutual fund business .
it is being determined beyond a reasonable doubt to my knowledge that they are forged passports .
tourism is a very important part of what our community can provide to Canada .
let me touch on that a little bit more .
youth STRATEGY
some people say there is at least one other part of British Columbia that is better than that .
one of them was the deficit , one was that spending was out of control , one was the debt out of control , the other was taxes out of control .
support for knowledge goes beyond support for university research .
this scientist is a thorn in the side of the department , with personal allegations that there are problems where profits take precedence over safety .
the Liberals for example made another appointment in the heart of Bloc Quebecois country .
this is nowhere more important than in our work to address the needs of aboriginal offenders who continue to be overrepresented in our correctional system .
we understand the multiplier effect that investing in technology has .
if we were able to drop those tax burdens we would have an increased labour supply , increased participation in the labour force , lower gross wage costs for employers , increased entrepreneurship and business start - up .
some hon. members :
they add up to a new division of powers for the 21 st century .
even if much of that frustration is based on perception rather than reality , it still grows as Canadians beyond this central region see their concerns ignored and in some cases brushed off as insignificant .
i say to my hon. colleagues there will never be a better time than now to change this system .
together with industry we will set goals and targets to improve Canada ' s global ranking in these and other sectors .
why this government insists on preventing small business people and young people from taking their rightful place in the international business community instead of providing them with opportunities to succeed and to ensure that future generations of Canadians are successful , we do not understand .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said that the Canadian government could have made the same remarks as France regarding Quebec ' s sovereignty .
they watched as my brother became a successful lawyer in Vancouver , while I spent my career in education in Oxford Country , retired and was first elected to the House in 1993 .
this is why the federal government should turn to the laws of Quebec for inspiration .
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain ( Guelph - Wellington , Lib . ) :
if a mall security guard legally removes a problem person for public disturbance , that person can return only moments later provided they do not resist when originally being escorted off the premises .
hon. Allan Rock
if you examine the way federal political parties are financed , you will immediately understand what caused the present situation .
at present there is no way of prosecuting those people in Canada .
we should co - operate .
it is important to give the correct figure .
incidentally , I would like the Universit 茅 de Montr 茅 al to organize a debate opposing the minister and myself .
in so far as the agriculture community is concerned , one of the things that I have done in my riding , and I have certainly been vocal in caucus as well , is to open up lines of communication .
" it is a nation in which citizens have access to the skills and knowledge they need '' .
none among us can claim - I see that the hon. member for Notre - Dame - de - Gr 芒 ce - Lachine is nodding her agreement - that the English Quebec community , the anglophone community , and the 90 some - odd other groups co - existing in Quebec , can be put on the same footing .
i represent the riding of Waterloo - Wellington , one of the four new ridings in Ontario and one of four new ridings in all of Canada .
however , all provinces must have the same powers .
i am an honest person .
we have to open up the Canadian Wheat Board .
crime in costing Canadians $ 46 billion a year .
madam Speaker , I am pleased to speak today to this bill that will finally bring the CPP up to date .
clearly two - thirds of the board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board will be representatives of the producers who are most directly affected .
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
Mr. David Iftody
i know the member opposite has a distinguished career in public service in British Columbia and I welcome his return to the House .
we presume that its majority will be effective in that respect .
national REVENUE
who would not protest when we know that these same lists were used to blackmail potential contributors to the coffers of the Liberal Party of Canada ?
to his credit , he has reversed his stand on the one issue of cost recovery proposals .
the government has changed the working income supplement to breathe more financial strength into parents who are trying to work and at the same time support their young families .
these people are trying to get medical attention , not pick up a parcel at their local department store .
Mr. Speaker , I am always interested in the comments of the hon. member , having worked with him in the last parliament on the justice committee .
unfortunately for Canadians I do not think the government is prepared to move forward .
i have two petitions to present today .
i was pleased to hear that the Minister of Justice also planned some legislation to scrap this section .
one can also wonder what position it would have put them in if the Liberals had had to explain why they were using the same financing methods as the Conservatives , whose methods they denounced time and time again when in opposition .
last term I was one of the founders of the Vaughan Technology Enterprise Centre , a project that identifies young entrepreneurs with a knack for high tech and teaches them the necessary skills to compete in the business world .
i wish to say a few things about the deficit and the debt and what we should do about them .

Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
canada ' s system of retirement income is one of the hallmarks of a country that represents the values Beryl Gaffney espoused , a country that cares for its citizens in need .
how can the member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot make such statements when he knows full well that the facts do not match the content of his cassette and cliches ?
the President of the United States was very frustrated because he had to have the consent of 35 people before he could agree to a deal .
it uses analogies like Ross Perot would do when he says on television " If you want to know why the car won ' t run , you have to open up the hood and look at the engine '' .
with the arrival of the philosopher Pierre Elliott Trudeau at the helm of the government , the deficit began to grow .
how does this help the person with less disposable income in our communities today ?
by restricting political party financing to voters only , Quebec was sending a very clear message : politics is to serve the common good , not the interests of corporations , be they large corporations or major trade unions .
Oxford County has been my home for over 40 years .
at the same time we note that R and D in agriculture has been cut by billions of dollars in recent years .
indeed , Canadians are up to the challenge .

we obtained improvements , and subsequently the government signed an agreement that works very well , thanks to the improvements we made to the agreement in general , and that was my party ' s policy during the election campaign in 1993 .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
right now , in both my riding offices , in Laurier - Station and Plessisville , I am getting calls from people .
let us remember , in spite of what we have been hearing for the last few minutes , that the text of the motion that we are debating with a minor amendment proposed a little earlier reads as follows :
they have not been able to sell their grain because all the elevators are plugged , again thanks to government intervention in the marketplace .
i want to outline one case tonight that has happened in the last couple of days .
the Government has already demonstrated its initial commitment to this project by increasing its contribution to the Canada Child Tax Benefit by $ 850 million a year , with higher payments to families beginning July 1 , 1998 .
i have mentioned the concerns of those within Quebec about the proposed amendment but I should like to take a moment to address briefly the concerns of other Canadians , Canadians who wonder what implications this constitutional amendment might have for them .
those Quebeckers receiving CPP benefits are individuals residing in Quebec who have worked all their lives in another province and who , accordingly , have contributed only to the CPP .
we expect them to be tabled in the House very soon .
in fact Levesque was getting car sick in the back and tried kick out the window .
i wish the government would remember whom it represents .
second the Canadian Grain Commission must approve an identity preservation system to ensure quality standards remain intact .
people are losing their jobs .
if after examination a committee were to present a report recommending that this issue required further consideration , the House would have the opportunity of considering the issue at that time .

the question should be posed always through the Chair .
Mr. Speaker , we know about the police investigation in my riding but nothing has been made public .
the reality is he does not have the faintest idea of what he is talking about .
it is an $ 800 million investment that has been applauded right across this country .
i met the member for Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac a few years back , when the Standing Committee on Finance was travelling across the country .
it contains no specific reference to Quebec or to Quebec culture .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :

there is another issue which I wanted to touch on briefly and that is the issue of the unfunded liability .
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - Orl 茅 ans , BQ ) :
i had absolutely no intention of participating in this debate but I think that I must set the record straight , with the benevolent and informed support of the hon. member for Berthier - Montcalm .
hon. John Manley
quite the opposite , Mr. Speaker .
the Speaker
then we asked had any Canadian officials actually seen the passports to determine that they were forged and he said no , other people had seen the passports .
i have a question which to me is entirely reasonable .
income TAXES
hon. Allan Rock
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Gordon Earle
how does the policy that the government is putting forward in terms of firearms sit with its decision to devolve this specialized task presently performed by ports police ?
i now would like to move :
i would also like to congratulate all members of the House of Commons who have been elected for the first time and those who have been re - elected and are back for the second or consecutive times to this Chamber .
as our government stressed in the recent Speech from the Throne , we are committed to working collaboratively with our provincial partners to strengthen and modernize country .
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia ) :
investments in science and technology increase Canada ' s productivity and competitiveness which fuel export growth and promote job creation at home .
in 1991 , RAMCO d 茅 veloppement spent $ 1.7 million to add to the building in order to make room for the employment centre .
the government has got its priorities wrong .
British Columbians are asking for nothing more and will settle for nothing less .
why can we not have this for Canada and create jobs as we do it ?
Mr. Gary Lunn
what are we to do ?
at present I have lived through the experience personally .
these would be a release valve .
any observer of the Quebec reality can see that the Minister of Human Resources Development does not visit certain parts of Quebec very often .
that is the good news .
in fact , according to the United Nations , Canada happens to provide the best quality of life of any country in the world .
that is quite a mouthful but it is important that the people who are watching Parliament recognize that we are speaking to Bill C - 2 , about the Canada pension plan .
it is noted that she promised victims better treatment but at the same time denies them and the majority of Canadians their demand to repeal section 745 of the Criminal Code .
we think that we can consult the public if necessary .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
in the weeks and months ahead , I will endeavour to live up to the expectations and trust that these people have shown in me .
that is not what the farmers in my area are telling me .
the hon. member was absolutely right when he raised this issue .
No.
we are pushing for a review of the Canadian Wheat Board issues and on wheat transportation issues in general .
it certainly will be enlightening to have you there .
this legislation is the Act to amend the Education Act .

security in Canada ' s retirement income system has been a key priority for the government .
is that what he intends ?

this morning , the Supreme Court of Canada invalidated the Quebec referendum act , while the federal government , sitting under the weight of allegations , has no such legislation .
Canadians in the back are asking " Have we got to a united Canada ? "
our prayers and best wishes are with both Sharon and Doug .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
to conclude I must say that at the same time that we move aggressively on the economic front we must work very hard on the political front to ensure that we remain a united country from sea to sea .
in Quebec , those who have contributed for two years out of the past three , five years out of the past ten or half of the contribution period are eligible for disability benefits .
Mr. Trevor Roote in my riding was a bit outraged when bureaucrats at the GST collection department said that they were losing revenue because of the exemptions for groceries , drugs and medical devices .
can we trust them now ?
it is an agreement that the Minister of Finance made with all provincial governments .
this clause provides for the exclusion by regulation of any kind , type , class or grade of wheat or barley from the provisions of part IV of the Canadian Wheat Board Act .
if the government had the fortitude to ask young Canadians , certainly those in their 20 s , 30 s and 40 s about their preferences , it would find an overwhelming number who would like to own their own retirement assets and not rely solely on the promises of a debt - laden government with a sorry track record .
there is no doubt that during the time of the Somalia incidents poor judgment was exercised in the case of some people , but there has been no government wide or forces wide conspiracy and none was found in the Somalia inquiry report .
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 221 , an act to amend the Canada Business Corporations Act .
the Inuit are a very adaptable people and I am very proud of the progress we have made in such a short time .
my colleagues , in your name and on your behalf I will be receiving these distinguished Canadian in room 216 for a reception .
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :

Mr. Pierre de Savoye
the auditor general in chapter 17 -
we repeat the suggestion to the Minister of Finance that this tax reform should take place in his second mandate .
Mr. Lee Morrison
i would really appreciate it if we could .
when he raised the question of privilege in the House , the hon. member stated that he had requested this meeting to obtain information which he contended was directly related to the preparation of a question which he wanted to ask the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development .
yet the government is saying that all is well and has resisted for the longest time any examination of what was happening on the Stoney reserve .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
i would like to hear , if at all possible , comment from the minister , but I would reserve even that judgment until I settle in my own mind the point that the hon. House leader has brought as well as that of the member for Winnipeg - Transcona .
Mr. Chuck Strahl
i appreciate having the honour to speak on this legislation and I support it .
order , please .
i knew this would be a country where I could build a home , a career and most importantly yes , a future .
we know that crime creates fear not just for our personal safety but also for the safety of our families and our communities .
Mr. Speaker , today as we debate Motion No. 3 we are embarking on a debate that has a number of interesting aspects to it .
this is rather absurd because the reason we are here today debating the motion is the diligence the government has had toward its fiscal agenda to reduce the annual deficit .
the third is one of the most interesting things .
first is the initial application with numerous forms and medical reports to assess eligibility .
the principal argument in the government ' s throne speech with respect to facilitating economic recovery is that it now has the deficit under control .
we entered into internship agreements with those sectors of the economy and now young people have a job and a future .
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to inform the House and all Canadians that September is arthritis month .
eighty percent of the fund must be invested in Canada but again there are no guidelines .
in fact if we look at the ratio of the changes we made to the benefits as opposed to the contributions , 25 % can be attributed to the changes in retirement benefits and 75 % can be attributed to changes in the contribution rate and also the actuarial estimates of the income that will come from this more advantageously managed fund .
furthermore , this experience revives their self confidence and increases their worth with future employers .
there is considerable evidence to support that early and aggressive intervention can be correlated to positive long term outcomes .
i see you rising , Mr. Speaker .
canada PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT
like many of us when we are confronted with two hard choices or options , she attempted for a while to pursue both .
let me put this as concisely as I can .
thank God it was not a BSE stock or we on the west coast would have taken all the heat for that one .
that is the democratic process and I think it is a very good piece of legislation .
Brian Tobin , the former Liberal fisheries minister and the premier of Newfoundland is currently receiving $ 3.8 million .
the Deputy Speaker :
the rapid aging of our population is one of the main reasons .
and the bells having rung :
Canadians have always known about the Liberal - Tory , same old story , but now it is Liberal - Reform , same old form as Liberals jump into bed with Reformers and Tories are there whining at the door to be let in on this new political orgy .
Mr. John Cannis :
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
the House met at 2 p.m.
it was not enough dissatisfaction to upset the government but it was dissatisfaction that the government needs to heed .
that is what we are about , a caring and loving country .
that compares with less than onepercent of Canadian companies overall that give to the Liberals .
Mr. Nelson Riis :
Mrs. Pauline Picard
the authors go on to state that employers will bear from 50 percent to as much as 100 percent of the tax , which implies a direct reduction in employment as a result of the payroll tax .
i might say -
it was a rookie mistake .
for a long time for too many Canadians Canada has seemed stuck .
we dislike seeing the young , the disadvantaged or the infirm exploited .
Mr. Ghislain Lebel
i do not know if there is any relationship between that person or this person and my riding .
i began as a teacher and progressed through the ranks to become a vice - principal , principal and superintendent with the Oxford County Board of Education .
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
they did not know her like I did but she was very special .
as the Minister of Labour stated at the official launch last Friday , we should never take for granted that we and our families will not be affected by fire .
we would enact bills to strengthen the economic and Canadian union .
the creation of the Canada television and cable production fund has supported the creation of excellent Canadian programming .
* * *
with respect to herbal remedies , we do recognize the importance of choice by Canadians .
the size of the province does not matter , whether it is Prince Edward Island , Quebec or Alberta .
it can be done , but do we have the will ?
i almost fell backwards when I read that , because the Minister of Finance has been anything but responsible in his last three budgets .
we are going to do the government ' s job for the government members because for reasons that I do not understand they think they have all the answers .
the focus or end target of our strong fiscal message is security and sustaining of the social safety net we enjoy .
Ms. Marlene Catterall :
Canadians reject the individualistic survival of the fittest approach being advanced by some of my hon. colleagues .
two - thirds of the board of directors will be farmers and that is exactly what this bill is all about .
maybe that is it .
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague from Surrey North for seconding this motion .
infrastructure
reform Party members certainly have no exclusivity on the desire to bring accountability to government and to reform government .
i would remind the hon. member when she talks about the closure of bases that bases have been closed in Quebec , in the maritimes , in Alberta and in Ontario .
Ms. Angela Vautour :
Mr. Reed Elley
to add insult to injury , the proposed CPP premiums will hit self - employed workers hardest , those workers of the new economy , yet will do nothing to address the unfounded liability facing younger generations .
over the years , I do not know in how many auditor general ' s reports , how many reports from interested academics , how many reports from people who were watch dogs of the government on issues , how many times the whole issue of irresponsible spending has been brought up to the government .
everyone is told a pension will be there for them and that there will be no increases .
the Speaker :
i do not think the member is very proud of that .
agreed .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
i think the hon. member would agree that there is no harm in doing so .
Mr. Ted White :
i congratulate my colleague , the Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , for the work he has done in the process of developing the bill over the last number of years .
as for the increase in tax revenues , where does the money come from ?
looking Outward
scientists understand that we will do the right thing .
in the case of Mr. Thompson , he was transferred to somewhere else in the department .
even the most socialistic of groups that have a pension plan run by the private sector is doing better than it would with the CPP .
Mr. Eug 猫 ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) :
experience shows that when young Canadians are looking for that first job , they are confronted with a vicious circle : no experience , no job ; no job , no experience .
Mr. Speaker , I want to applaud the hon. member ' s comments .
community ORGANIZATIONS
Ms. Bonnie Brown ( Oakville , Lib . ) :
the land covers fiords , mountains and tundra .
a parliamentary committee will allow those with qualms about the proposed changes to voice them and it will give those who advocate the new system an opportunity to allay these concerns .
Mr. Attias had even offered to lower the rent by close to 30 % .

Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) :
MACKENZIE VALLEY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT
until that time I think we should examine them and see if the problem is as acute as he says it is .
there is a wide consensus that successful crime prevention must take a comprehensive approach to tackling the root problems that lead to crime , and that these efforts must start at the earliest stages of a child ' s life .
the hon. secretary of state , if you would like to answer that question , go ahead .
there are provinces , especially those led by NDP governments , that are resisting very vigorously .
we are here in this House to discuss them .
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Kitchener - Waterloo , Lib . ) :
there is every reason to think there could be measures put into place to protect people against disability .
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member .
i find this very , very intolerable .
i have undertaken to get the facts for the hon. member .
the key recurring theme was that Canadians believe in the CPP and they want it preserved .
* * *
we have responded to these concerns and will continue to respond as we must .
however , we learned this morning that its services are no longer required at Mirabel and that the RCMP will remain in charge of security at that airport .

it will give the provinces the latitude they need to develop the cultural and economic institutions that best reflect their particular values .
the Speaker :
perhaps he could do that , but that is of no real interest to me .
either he is frighteningly incompetent , or he is trying to mislead this House .
order , please .
is the House ready for the question ?
i have outlined the foregoing to put into context the kind of environment in which we will work in the House and this Parliament .
why did the Prime Minister go to the polls three years into the mandate ?
* * *
i especially like the idea in the prime minister ' s remarks of supporting young people .
my understanding , and I have just been passed a note to this effect , is that Canadian officials have seen the passports and they have been asked to establish that they are forged .
that is all we are asking , but those members want to keep this thing a dictatorial body governed not at arms ' length from the government .
rather , it diminishes the view of this House .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
i hope that this situation can be cleared up in the local Liberal associations , where individual candidates may have been involved as part of the nomination process .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
as far as we are concerned it is an obligation .
they call on the government to take various steps to strengthen family life in Canadian society .
our opponents have not offered anything more than cuts to the programs for farmers .
on social policies there is a very thin veneer but almost without any substance to it .
the House met at 10 a.m.

i heard my good friend , the member of the Tory party , speaking a couple of times before me talking about what the Tories would do and I listened to what the Liberals would do , yet this plan is $ 560 billion in debt .
the government ' s priorities are first and foremost employment , improved public finances and Canadian unity .
it has been here from time to time to stand up to the provinces and say it will not agree with them on a particular program or policy thrust .
* * *
we need benchmarks to ensure debt reduction .
as you know , a general election was held in Canada during that period .
unless there are new facts that members would like to bring to the argument , as opposed to support one way or the other , I will take it under advisement .
appointment OF CHAIRMAN
any physician would agree .
he went about it in a very open clear obvious way .
it is unacceptable .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
it is Portage - Lisgar for the information of the hon. member for Winnipeg South .
this House declines to give second reading to Bill C - 2 , an act to establish the Canada pension plan investment board and to amend the Canada pension plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts since the principle of the bill , while attempting to address the failures of the Canada pension plan , is particularly unfair to young Canadians and fails to recognize the employment impacts of the CPP premium increases .
we encourage research and indeed , through the Medical Research Council , we invest in medical research .
the following important features of the Canada pension plan remain unchanged .
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to introduce my private member ' s bill , an act to amend the Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act .
it is one thing to see the interpretation of the law that affects the sense of justice of our people .

last year Canadians spent over $ 2.9 billion on arts events and products .
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold
some hon. members :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to be able to join in the debate on the Canada pension plan .
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini 猫 re , BQ ) :
will the Minister of Justice stop worrying about the protection of the rights of criminals , do the right thing and repeal section 745 , this offensive and potentially dangerous piece of legislation .
the proposed initiatives to promote Canada ' s economic , social and cultural development are far from innovative and unlikely to give hope and create the momentum required to get the men , women and children of this country excited about the 21 th century .
i now look at my family , my four sons :
i am thinking of the volunteer organizations which have had to do more , often with less .

as far as fabrications and allegations of friendship between the owner and myself , if the member had truly listened to my speech he would know that this is a regional decision , that there was a regional consensus and that this government is , once again , disregarding decisions made at the regional level and agreements reached regionally .
so , at this stage , the issue is whether or not we support the idea of a public pension plan .
it it a great honour to be back in this Chamber .
i would like him to comment on what is the real mood in the community and what are the mainstream Canadian values that Canadians hold which seem to be somewhat different than what they actually get from the justice system .
Ms. Alexa McDonough
the people involved , who enjoyed close ties with the old traditional parties , the Liberals and the Conservatives - or the Conservatives and the Liberals , if you prefer - allegedly filled their pockets with compensation money paid directly by cabinet .
the hon. member for St. Paul ' s could not answer that question .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
it will hold public meetings at least every two years in each participating province : transparency and accountability .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
free TRADE AGREEMENT
when we in western Canada send 60 Reform MPs representing all the rural areas we say what farmers need .
they should be in addition to research assistants available to other committee members .
i was born in Ottawa because of my parents ' decision to come here and be part of that social democratic movement .
where in the speech from the throne is the new Atlantic Canadian economic initiative , one that recognizes that the approaches of the past , the subsidies and handouts and that type of thing , are simply not working ?
he lost most Canadians and most people in the House before he got on board the particular ship .
it would be the same with the steel industry and with the fishermen in my part of the country .
is the excessive tax hike and the resulting burden placed on generations x and even y fair ?
until that time I will use whatever communication skills I have to fight for the interests of the people of Dartmouth as their member of Parliament .
i want to thank all the volunteers who worked so hard to ensure that the riding of Longueuil is once again represented in the House of Commons by the only party that looks after their interests and has done so since 1993 , the Bloc Quebecois .
the Deputy Speaker :
Sault Ste. Marie is a leading exporter of steel , wood and paper products .
ten out of fifteen people on the board of directors are from the industry .
these people have to go .
he has become wealthy because people spent their money .
fixing crime in the different communities in our country will come only with the direct and meaningful involvement of those placed in and knowledgeable about the particular communities in which they reside .
in both cases , that is the move of the Saint - J 茅 r 么 me employment centre and the RCMP investigation , we find the same silence which truly gives us the impression that someone from that party has a guilty conscience .
i think it emphasizes the problems most people have today with the kind of mentality this government has .
given that the finance committee hopefully will be involved in the most extensive prebudget consultations that we have ever seen in this country , it makes a lot of sense to refer it to a subcommittee .
many of my colleagues have talked about the funding as being pay as you go .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
since it is practically impossible to meet the Minister of Human Resources Development and to shed light on this vital issue for the socio - economic development of the Laurentian region , I urge the minister to take into consideration the questions that follow and to provide me with answers as quickly as possible .

hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
for starters , just recently Intrawest invested $ 500 million in Mont - Tremblant .
therefore , I would like this issue to be postponed until tomorrow , if possible .
the throne speech touches on many areas of importance to my constituents .
i want to compliment the Minister of Human Resources Development .
everyone would pay into it .
we as members of Parliament have the right to inform them and to try to convince them of the merits of this constitutional amendment .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
is he aware that Bombardier and the Cormorant helicopter group have just hired as a lobbyist the ex - executive assistant to the minister of defence ?
the benefits of extensive awareness programs and early detection screening are starting to be felt as mortality rates for breast cancer in Canada have begun to decline .
it may not be overnight that we get it back up to the $ 19 billion it was when they took office but certainly we could start today to reverse that so people are not forced into a difficult decision .
this is the reason why the government and the Liberal Party said in the election campaign in May that we propose to spend half of any surplus or extra revenues on tax reduction and debt reduction and the other half on the development of social and economic programs .
specifically , what is the member ' s opinion of the electoral process ?
will it actually help the Canadian economy by having the fund hold bank stocks ?
each province has its problems and concerns and governments are not always as good as they should be .
it is fine to encourage Canadians to put their money aside , but the same Canadians should be allowed to get the maximum return on the money they are setting aside .
it is very generous of him .
a motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved
it is the custodian of the nation ' s freedom '' .
points OF ORDER
it is important that the Reform Party recognizes that .
for this reason I am asking all members of this House to support this bill , which reflects the will of those who elected us .
what is less clear is that , in neither the last referendum nor the last electoral campaign , not even in the meeting at Calgary , was there any manifestation of leadership by our Prime Minister .
my Ministers are regularly meeting their provincial colleagues to eliminate irritants and to improve services to people where the federal and provincial governments have joint responsibilities .
house OF COMMONS
Mr. Speaker , I have several points that will constitute new information to assist you in making your decision .
it is one thing to want linguistic school boards and another thing to want to achieve them by way of a constitutional change .
BRITISH COLUMBIA
" integrity and honesty must be restored to the political process , " page 91 in the red book .
the other parties are wrong when they say that tax cuts can only come at the expense of the debt .
they forgot that across the way .
( official Version )
yet we find that other persons are also covered under that clause .
i might as well at the same time remind our colleagues at the other end , the NDP , I also find it shameful that somebody would stand in this House and try to one up the Conservative Party , try to grab the stage on national unity in British Columbia at the expense of a country .
the political risks of such initiatives are being eliminated as successes are being documented .
i am confident that , with such flexibility and the synergy fostered by this government , we will enter the new millennium with a new invigorated Canada .
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
last year the celebration of Yonge Street as 200 years old held special significance for Innisfil as much of its history was impacted by the development of what was known as Penetanguishene Road and later Yonge Street .
having said that , I reassure the hon. member that I will be taking under advisement that which the supreme court said and I will be reviewing it in the coming days .
an Angus Reid poll yesterday showed strong support for a federation that respects the equality of provinces while recognizing that one of them is obviously unique in an anglophone North America .
there is a condition which was added during the last Parliament .
members will note from the Speech from the Throne that the government has understood , better I think than governments in other countries , that the approaching 21 st century will be a knowledge century dominated by those who have mastered the new sciences and technologies and who have comprehended the infomatics revolution .
among the most important initiatives announced in the Speech from the Throne were those that focused on the youth of our nation .
the other day I asked the Minister for International Trade a question about when and how and if the government was going to permit the public to have some say in what the government ' s stance would be in the negotiations with respect to the multilateral agreement on investment .
Mr. Nelson Riis
the fund will reward academic excellence and provide thousands of scholarships each year .
a recent study conducted in the Quebec City area shod that every dollar invested in the Quebec summer festival , for instance , generated $ 8 in tax revenues and so on for the federal government .
Mr. Speaker , I know that for you to do something about this would be to break with Canadian precedent .

they understand that fully 60 percent of the population in aboriginal communities is under the age of 25 .

we offer our condolences to the members of his family , to his friends and colleagues and our sincere regrets in his passing .
Mr. Yvan Loubier
but does he really have to waste taxpayers ' dollars on it ?
the names just announced are on the second ballot .
the question I would like to have put to the member for Calgary Southeast , and I am sorry he does not have an opportunity to reply , is whether he is prepared right now to move a private member ' s bill , which he can write himself , giving MPs the option of opting out of the pension plan .
the Acting Speaker ( Mrs.
what are the programs that have the most impact and the most effect in terms of job creation in this country ?
i opened up my Oxford dictionary and it clearly says that a tax is a contribution to the state .
they want to be Canadian first , especially when the very existence of our country is in question .
railways are accountable for moving grain according to agreed on terms .
the accusations made by the hon. member opposite are irresponsible .

the only issue before the House now is why is the NDP walking arm and arm toward the sunset and out of the CPP ?
Mr. Michel Gauthier
ladies and Gentlemen :
i am sure all hon. members on a daily basis receive representation from families that have aging parents or grandparents , that have a legitimate need for home care .
i merely have to look across the Chamber to see such a calculating , cynical political party .
that is what we have done .
in spite of consistent promises to the mayor and citizens of Windsor who want this to happen , nothing has been done to approach our attorney general in order to start the dice rolling , as we say in Windsor .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
the proposed amendment clearly demonstrates that we can work side by side with the Quebec government to modernize the federation , a federation which belongs to us all .
Mr. Peter Adams
we should not be doing it by a committee that travels around once in a while to ask people what should be in this year ' s budget .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
yesterday I asked for the unanimous consent of the House to deem the bill to have passed all stages in the House once again .
first , let me tell you what remains the same .
the very first principle of parliamentary law as set out in Beauchesne ' s states :
in fact , the sacrifices made were by those that the load of debt or spending was dumped on through the different provinces , transfer payments and the like .
i need to refer to my notes . This
yesterday the Minister of Finance ordered that closure be brought against the CPP legislation , which touches the lives of every Canadian family .
just because the member speaks of his youth does not mean he speaks for the youth .
the comedy of errors that we have seen over the last few days here in this Chamber leads me to believe that David Letterman is really the guy who is in charge of foreign affairs over there because of the absurdity of some of things we have seen come forward .
this is what had to be done and it was done promptly .
the government decided that there was either a monopoly or there was no wheat board .
Mr. Speaker , today this government is proposing to introduce the single largest tax increase in history .
* * *
the fiscal course is set .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
there were two members who rose .
Mr. Jack Ramsay :
Mr. Speaker , most in the House , indeed most Canadians , will understand very clearly the commitment that the government made to ensure that down the road we have a pension system that is not only fair to people today , but is fair to those who will need it later .
the GST rebate worked the same way .
having lived in that country , I cannot understand how the international community can remain unmoved by the unbearable situation the people of Algeria are in .
whether they live in rural Canada , in a city , on the east coast , on the west coast or anywhere in between , Canadians deserve a government that is innovative , ready to lead and ready to advance new efforts to secure their future in a new economy .
hon. Sergio Marchi
i do not mind .
we know that the Liberal Party exists to take and maintain power .
on national unity they have kept their ears covered .
according to a poll conducted last year , barely 4 percent of voters have some confidence in members of Parliament .
a Speaker ' s ruling is of course not appealable .
Mr. Speaker , speaking about higher risks , how about high priorities in terms of sisters of employees and whatnot making money on the taxpayer in that department ?
the Speaker only determines whether an application based on a claim of contempt or breach of privilege is , on first impression , of sufficient importance to set aside the regular business of the House and go forward for a decision by the House .
breast cancer remains a major health problem for women in Canada .
i invite all members to add their names to this list and to join us in Sault Ste. Marie for what promises to be a truly unforgettable event .
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) :
in the case of Quebec , the present government of Quebec is not interested in consulting Quebecers on their genuine participation within Canada .
the problem with the Liberals , which comes back to regional development , is that they believe government spending can create jobs .
if the Prime Minister is not bothered by these sort of fundraising tactics , will he at least put this grant on hold until the police clear up the Shawinigan shakedown ?
most of all we must continue to see the unemployment situation for what it is , a battle , a war that must be fought until every Canadian who wishes to work and can work is afforded that opportunity .
in 1995 , there was another referendum where - let me finish , I will not be long - there was no winner .
people and companies trade with countries they feel most comfortable with , in languages they can speak and in cultures they understand .
there are plans to do the same in the port of Saint John as well as the port of Halifax .
Ms. Alexa McDonough :
in fact , if the Conservative Party deserves praise - but let us not forget that criticism may follow quickly - it is for implementing at least a major part of the tax reform , as the member pointed out , by introducing the GST .
our plan covers people who leave the workforce temporarily to look after their children .
that is an absolutely critical point because we believe so fervently that it is the people of Canada , the taxpayers , the people who voted us into these chairs , who own these chairs , who own this House who would say now that we have a surplus , where should that money be spent .
best of all , he was a friend .
he is a fair and honest man who , as an MP , served Sault Ste. Marie extremely well and as minister of Indian affairs also served Canadians extremely well .
* * *
to protect ourselves from being subverted by that pressure I refer members to page 140 of Hansard and the remarks of my colleague from Hillsborough when he talked about more power being put to members of this assembly .
we will also develop new programs to help young Canadians acquire the experience and marketable skills to take advantage of the opportunities in today ' s job market .
i also would have liked to have asked the hon. member for Qu ' Appelle when he speaks so eloquently of how proud he is of the Saskatchewan government with regard to all the things it does in particular with medicare , whether or not he is proud that it had to shut 50 hospitals and whether or not the $ 2 billion that is spent across the line might be better spent trying to keep some of those open .
madam Speaker , I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand .
we are a bilingual and multicultural country at a time of increasing globalization .
Mr. Speaker , it is with great pleasure that I respond to that question .
however , we have faced reality and are dealing with the problem .
health
that is why I oppose it .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
twenty - five per cent real youth unemployment is eating away at our country ' s future .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Industry .
Mr. Speaker , the President of the Treasury Board would appear to be the Quebec godfather in the Government of Canada .
when we talk about peoples and nations , it always involves a clearly defined judicial system , as is the case in Quebec .
we continue to argue that can be achieved , recognized and enhanced within the context of a continuing Canadian federalism .
No.
privilege
is this what they call justice , Mr. Speaker ?
i wonder if any of them know how much surplus they need .
i should advise the government that , as my party ' s critic for science , research and development , I will monitor the establishment of this foundation and the funds that will be invested in these areas .
there are certainly many changes occurring .
the prime minister and the government have set out the rules of thumb on how it thinks the surplus should be dealt with .
Mr. John Richardson :
fisheries
Mr. John Nunziata
Scaling back CPP and OAS benefits will hurt low and middle income seniors .
why do they feel that way ?
the Chilean government has it .
my question was quite clear .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
i had the privilege of meeting Mr. Fraser in 1967 , when he was clerk and I was working in this place for the summer .
thank you , Mr. Speaker , for recognizing me .
we do not have a bunch of people holding on to this money in a back room somewhere .
i am quite concerned .
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
it is an honour today to rise and introduce this bill on amending the Young Offenders Act .
it is the fairest way to honour our commitments .
for myself , I would like to add that Alistair Fraser touched the lives not only of parliamentarians , but of the people working in the House of Commons during his time there .
i am not going to stand here and say that average Canadians have all the answers .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
the resolution was passed by a majority of the mayors of the Rivi 猫 re - du - Nord RCM on September 17 .
Mr. Michel Gauthier
i have my father to thank for my start in politics .
the Canadian Wheat Board Advisory Committee would be terminated when deemed appropriate by the minister responsible for the wheat board but not before the end of its current mandate at the end of 1998 .
it has served western farmers well since 1935 and they made it clear in the barley plebiscite last February that they want to keep the Canadian Wheat Board as a single desk seller for their grain .
one hundred and sixteen thousand dollars was given to a committee to study the sexual habits of seniors .
Ms. Angela Vautour
i do sing although I am not a violin player , that is for sure .
because of the not for profit nature of the Canadian Wheat Board the cost to farmers for the premiums commanded by the board amount to mere pennies per bushel .
is this simply lip service as in last week ' s Speech from the Throne ?
obviously the member has never read a paper from British Columbia or looked at what happened to his government in British Columbia , the New Democratic Party government .
it is partly why we are considered the very best country in the world today .
let me state that again because that is something everyone in this House and everyone in society should be aware of .
we know where that kind of promise went the last time .
Mrs. Francine Lalonde
our efforts must bring together the expertise of those responsible for housing , social services , public health , recreation , schools and policing .
we are going to destroy the incentive of these young people .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
the result is that some 75 percent of the reduction has been made on the financing side and only 25 percent is on the benefit side .
the only way for our common future is not the status quo but the independence of Quebec , a new relationship , a new partnership with Canadian citizens .
Mr. Ted White :
Mr. Speaker , I too want to congratulate the hon. member for Nunavut .
the new hospital features over $ 25 million in state of the art equipment and will be the location of Ontario ' s newest breast screening site .
having listened to the hon. member across the way , I wonder if there is some word you could provide me with that I could use that would be acceptable in this House to point out the error of his way .
casting doubt on those rules now indicates obvious bad faith and , in particular , a profound disdain for the near - victory of the yes side in the last referendum .
i knew at that time something was wrong because there were tears in her eyes .
the hope I place in this Parliament and in this government is that they come up with an action plan .
without their support , the results might have been different .
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) :
he was involved at 16 years old .
if they let me speak , I could complete what I had to say on spending .

will the Minister of the Environment assure Canadians that Parks Canada , Environment Canada and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans environmental impact assessment concerns are addressed and a proper management plan initiated ?
other speakers have referred to the two extremes .
some companies are already convinced that partnerships in home care for their employees is just plain good business .
many of these changes are characterized as necessary because of the increasingly competitive global economy .
given that the minister is temporarily out of the House , I would suggest that she be able to examine what has been stated by the hon. member opposite and respond tomorrow in the House of Commons , or at a later time .

i do not think there is anyone in any part of this country who could stand up today to say with any degree of confidence that our health care system can sustain those types of cuts .
the prime minister has never lobbied or influenced me .
there are similarities and there are differences .
frankly that is not what -
there is one solid government achievement that we all celebrate .
this government could act today to improve the lives of the people I represent .

could the minister explain why he and his government are so insensitive to the concerns of British Columbia ?
Mr. Speaker , this week is Legion Week here in Ontario .
this is about the devolution of authority to local organizations , councils and communities .
this is one of the most critical issues facing our country and I hope the government will give serious consideration to these constructive suggestions .
i want to do the best job I can do for them as well .
they are not the people who benefit from the bond trades and the stock market rallies .
it is interesting to hear what he had to say about the management of the Caisse .
it will create a better understanding of the true complexity and difficulty for all of us in severing ties -
Mr. Speaker , I was struck by the compassionate and passionate speech by the member for Longueuil .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
we have to deal with the experts .
by telling Canadians that the federal government no longer has to make tough decisions , we risk going back to the welfare state where entrepreneurs who brought about innovation will become lobbyists in search of government goodies .
it is fair to say that as a result of the old age security program and other pension plans like the Canada pension plan we can take pride in that fact major steps in the past have ensured that Canada ' s elderly are able to live out their lives in dignity .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
you will agree that this is not the same thing as the real economic partnership we are proposing to Canada .
Mr. Speaker , I am glad the parliamentary secretary had the opportunity to speak .
look at what happened to a former Conservative prime minister .
attacking child hunger and the roots of youth crime must therefore be a priority of this government in its attack on child poverty .
finally , there are those people receiving CPP benefits who then move to Quebec .

highways
hon. Don Boudria
if the member thinks that all the provinces are equal , therefore that Quebec is equal to Prince Edward Island , in spite of all the beauty that Prince Edward Island has to offer with its beaches and the ingenuity of its people , it essentially means that the member thinks that we are not a nation , that there is only one nation , the Canadian nation , and that he does not want things to change to recognize the fact that we speak French , that our political system is different , that our justice system is different , that we have a vernacular language , that we have a collective desire to survive and , most of all , that Quebec is the only state in the world that is controlled by 82 per cent of the population .
Mr. Speaker , I would like first to congratulate the hon. member ' s appointment as critic for the Conservative Party and I welcome him back to the House .
more than 25 percent of Canada ' s homeless are children and , despite cheerful words to the contrary in the Speech from the Throne , it is not getting any better .
Mr. Speaker , if the government is not to be intimidated by the Premier of Quebec and is not prepared to say exactly how it will consult with Quebeckers on the premiers ' declaration , could the minister at least make the simple commitment to mail a copy of the Calgary declaration to every household in Quebec so Quebeckers will at least know what is being talked about in the rest of the country ?

Mr. Speaker , if the human resources development minister was doing what the prime minister suggests by simply fulfilling his duty , why was it that the Minister of Human Resources Development felt it was incumbent upon him to report this to the minister of public works and the President of the Treasury Board immediately after bringing this to the attention of the RCMP ?

the key here is that we are now in a position to debate and make those decisions and not have those decisions made for us .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
the hon. member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough .
the first theft , this country ' s greatest theft , started then , when it took over the power of taxation from the province , supposedly on a temporary basis , and never gave it back .
we know that the government ' s record is on health care .
Mr. Dale Johnston ( Wetaskiwin , Ref. ) :
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
let him stand and say so .
Mr. Speaker , I have informed the House that I have never been a partner in that law firm .
while the 1982 Constitution is still being condemned by secessionist leaders , this same Constitution allows them to request this amendment today .
i am very much aware that we have to consult those involved in preparing an integrated strategy for the money we intend to spend .
as with all plans , public and private plans , there are always administrative challenges .
more than anything else the team Canada missions which our Prime Minister began have demonstrated these very strengths and are broadening the spectrum of Canadians involved in global trade .
Mr. Monte Solberg
it reflects the essence of the Western Canadian Marketing Panel ' s recommendations on Canadian wheat board governance and operational flexibility and also establishes the criteria and general process for making changes to the wheat board ' s marketing mandate .
Mr. Rob Anders :
however , I think he embellishes the picture .
madam Speaker , I listened with interest to my hon. friend .
i wonder whether she could confirm for the House that the senator from Alberta who died a few years ago , the former Premier Ernest Charles Manning , was the father of the current leader of the Reform Party in this House ?
where deficiencies exist what we will endeavour to do is not simply to be critical but to offer new ideas that can perhaps turn this dry bones throne speech into something vibrant and new and appropriate to leading the country into the 21 st century .
trade and investment deals open a lot of doors , but what happens if our companies cannot take advantage of these deals and conditions at home do not allow them to survive and grow ?
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) :
therefore I am always concerned about giving our Canadian businesses the best opportunities to take part in the global economy .
given these facts , I am still both anxious and optimistic about the future .
that is what they did .
Mr. Speaker , anybody could have done better than the federal Tories in reducing the deficit .
one further piece of reference for your consideration was referred to by the hon. member .
Mr. Speaker , first allow me to thank the residents of the new riding of Lotbini 猫 re for electing me to represent them in the House of Commons .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
can the minister confirm that there are in excess of 200 citizens of Vietnam in Canada under deportation order mostly for criminal activity ?
Mr. Dick Harris
debates are at the heart of parliamentary democracy , where it is appropriate to support opposing views .
coming home to Canada I realized yet again how truly lucky we are to live in such a wonderful nation .
it is my belief that economic prosperity will lead generally to a better quality of life , to lower crime rates , to a lack of other social problems , to lower welfare rates and to a generally better lifestyle .
this initiative funded through the transitional job fund is an example of the success of our job creation commitment , and that is just one example in my riding .
i say to the Bloc Quebecois member that we French Canadians outside Quebec have no use for the kind of support Bloc members have been giving us from time to time since they arrived in this place , by using our problems to promote their separatist goal .
this is one of the most onerous tasks of the Chair and surely one which I do not relish .
the public wants improvements and one way to improve this federation would be through the principles set out in the Calgary declaration , including the recognition of the unique character of Quebec ' s society .
the changes to the Canadian Wheat Board that are proposed in Bill C - 4 have been designed to respond to the wishes of western Canadian grain farmers .
Mr. Mauril B 茅 langer
as the minister has pointed out so well , we cannot ignore the secessionist ambitions of the Government of Quebec .
let me point out that the problems we are facing with our pension system are not unique to Canada .
canada ' s personal income tax rate is through the roof .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau
the level of public interest in this was demonstrated admirably when over 200 people turned out to an all day forum which I held in 1995 to hear from constituents of all ages .
the Speaker read to the House a letter from the Secretary to the Governor General informing him that His Excellency the Governor General would proceed to the Senate chamber on Tuesday , September 23 , 1997 , at 2.30 p.m. to open officially the first session of the 36 th Parliament .
it would also require recipients to specify the percentage the total cost of the grant represents at the time the program is announced or advertised and open to the public .
i would hope the Liberals on the other side would support that private member ' s bill and maybe even lift it up and adopt it as their own to get rid of the trade barriers that are limiting us .
the government also chose to ignore any mention in the throne speech of the premiers ' pledge to involve the public before advancing their proclamation .
Mr. Dale Johnston
if we tell farmers they are empowered to make decisions following a process that consults with the producers , and as in the act a vote must be taken , what does the member of the Reform Party fear ?
we continue to see small businesses prospering as never before in the wake of interest rates at the lowest level in 30 years -
as our agriculture and agri - food critic said earlier , the Bloc Quebecois supports this government measure .
for me and for my party the last three and a half or four years have been very much about learning more about Canada , about exploring our possibilities and about going forward .
i also want to take the opportunity to thank the people of Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough who have entrusted in me this great honour to represent them in these hallowed halls and in this House .
Canadians in all regions want to ensure that people in need are not forgotten .
here again we see political considerations even before the thing is set up creeping into the direction given to the board .
however , on the topic of competent governance , we have a prime minister who has never given the country a balanced budget or had the courage to stem the rising tide of hurtful taxation .
i know Michel Rioux very well .
i have a confident belief that we have the resources , human and material , to bring to bear on these problems and I am hoping that we can find a solution .
government ORDERS
those pillars remain under this legislation .
they talk about democracy , with 10 of its members being voted in and 5 being elected .
it is the strongest form of protest that could have been expressed under the circumstances , short of cutting relations with a country .
i suspect that as active members of Parliament we are in touch regularly with seniors who are having a difficult time getting by , who are have a tough time making it on the meagre pensions that they receive .
hockey
we do not need to go back to the past like the Reform Party that would have us privatize a lot of our social programs , have us set up two tier medical care in this country where we would have one system for the rich and one for the poor , where we only have tax breaks for the wealthy , where we get rid of the public pension plans like the Canada pension plan and turn everything into private pensions or RRSPs that favour wealthy people because they believe they can look after their own future better than anybody else .
Mr. Bob Kilger :
please note that under the new law the choice of president requires consultation in advance with the other directors .
some people say that we should not care about the other people , that we should treat them with disdain , that we should charge on and do our own thing .
comments DURING QUESTION PERIOD
i met Mr. Fraser on several occasions when my father took his oath in this House .
accordingly , the Association des coop 茅 ratives d '茅 conomie familiale ( ACEF ) in my riding yesterday invited me to attend the launch of a training course intended to help people of all ages prepare for retirement .
celebrating the Millennium
perhaps that is the legacy that Canada can leave to the world , of having people of different tastes , different cultures , different languages working and celebrating together in harmony for the benefit of all .
i would also like to mention the inestimable support I have received from my wife and family .
it realized that as soon as it started to pay the debt down , the interest payments would begin to retract very quickly and there would be more money to spend on other programs .
i do not farm .
i am sure the wording of these resolutions will reflect the sentiment of the various public consultations that have occurred in their provinces .
has the member not considered the difficulty that would be posed for Canada and for Quebec in the event of a separation and in the event the Cree people of Quebec decided that they , in their own democratic self - determining way , did not want to continue to be a member of Quebec as it is now understood but rather a member of what would be left of Canada after such a separation ?
if that is what would have happened to the small business I operated in Castlegar , in the interior of British Columbia , think what it will do to countless hundreds of thousands of businesses across the country .
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib . ) :
there will be evidence shortly that the Calgary declaration shows once again that the views of other Canadians and Quebeckers are irreconcilable .
this is cause for concern .
Mr. Speaker , I question how well the hon. member listened .
Canadians will see that there are alternate ways and better ways to save , to invest and to secure their retirement incomes and their futures .
the Bloc Quebecois has never deviated from its basic principles .
looking ahead to the millennium , we have an opportunity to explore new horizons , set new goals for our country and work together to reach those goals .
i am at a loss to explain why he now seeks to condemn the government for this proposal .
congratulations .

the Deputy Speaker :
i spent a long time in the last Parliament trying to explain to several Reform members what that condition was with the Ontario Wheat Board and our sales .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) moved :
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate that very important question .
over that period of time he had to exert a good deal of effort looking at the pension funds in the province of New Brunswick and trying to find some solutions to their funding for future generations .
i would also ask Quebecers , who are so proud of their culture , to look at this way of remaining within a renewed Canada , which will respect the cultural and economic diversity of its provincial partners .
Mr. Speaker , I will reply to the two questions the hon. member has posed .
i think it is good that we are moving away from the system whereby the funds were available to the provinces at very low interest rates .
she also used the word " illegally " in reference to actions on behalf of the Prime Minister ' s signing .
it is a day to reflect on the importance of education and the contributions of teachers to education .
madam Speaker , again pursuant to the standing orders and seconded by my colleague and friend from Nanaimo - Alberni , I am introducing a private members ' bill dealing with the Criminal Code and violent offences .

we are putting very substantial amounts into the transitional job fund and , as several of my colleagues from the Atlantic region know full well , this fund is in the best interests of those who live in Atlantic Canada .
Mr. Speaker , it is with regret that I learned today that Premier Frank McKenna of New Brunswick has decided to quite politics .
the hon. member for Champlain .
it could precipitate the resignations of the minister and the chief justice .
Mr. Speaker , I know the Reform Party often has trouble with the facts , as we have seen in the House quite often .
that is also one of the compelling reasons why such leadership should be exercised .
it meant that whole chunks of the only law of national redress ever to be passed by the National Assembly , Bill 101 , were invalidated , as concerns display in administrative terms , and of course the Canada clause versus the Quebec clause .
Mr. Speaker , that was a long question and , leaving aside the preamble , the nub of it was are we going to cut taxes .
my observations of Reform and the comments of its members seem to indicate that they are very regionally based and focused .
there is more homelessness in my community because the federal government has callously abandoned the development of social and co - op housing .
he kept his word .
resumption OF DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS IN REPLY
the throne speech demonstrated that the government has a clear vision of where it would like to take this country in the course of this current mandate .
in fact in most cases when dealing with serious violent offenders , with sexual predators , it has been shown that it does not work .
this is a realistic goal considering that the Inuit population of Nunavut is over 80 per cent and the working language will be Inuktitut .

this festival underscores the German heritage of our area in Ontario and in Canada .
we are here to ensure there is a modicum , a standard and a benchmark by which Canadians at the lower end of the economic spectrum will never be let down .
certain information has it that the President of the Treasury Board plans to introduce a bill whose objective would be to side step Canadian human rights legislation on pay equity in order to impose his position in this matter .
there are thousands of unfilled jobs out their because we did not help our young people prepare for the demand .
there is a message in that .
the Speaker :
it is because of what is happening in our region .
any Canadian over age 65 as of December 31 , 1997 who elects to receive CPP as of this date their pension will not be affected .
we want to make sure that the Constitution is amended under the rule of law .
but it is with a great deal of sadness that we have to admit that one out of every five elderly people in our country live in poverty .
further , when a government is in full blown operation and is now the victim and its members at arm ' s length in an RCMP criminal investigation , it is wrong .
since my election , dozens of civilian workers have approached me and asked that I fight for their rights for a decent salary , for job security in the face of privatization .
it is also an area full of lakes and hills where one can do some sailing , boating and trekking during the summer and ski or go on snowmobile tours during the winter .
it is pathetic .
why do they not stand in the House and tell the people of Atlantic Canada " Yes , we will give you a tax cut .
the first opportunity , I would assume , will be in the next day or so , not on the Order Paper for the foreseeable future .
the bunch cannot be trusted .
the first trend is that a large portion of young Canadians can and will succeed on their own .
the government is also requiring the Canadian Wheat Board to prepare a corporate plan annually , under clause 19 .
we have the values of sharing and mutual help .
Mr. Ghislain Fournier
the question we asked last week was whether the Clerk of the Privy Council was also advised of this to ensure the integrity of the government and to ensure the integrity of cabinet discussions .
pollsters and pundits have been filling the airwaves and newspapers with their take on the reaction of the people of Quebec and they will continue to do so even after all the provincial resolutions have been tabled .
it should not have to be that way .
SIKHS
they do not know if they will be able to meet their payments .

Mr. Dick Harris

this is a victory for them .

Mr. Speaker , yesterday , Guy Gendron reported on CBC radio that Jacques Roy , who works in the office of the President of the Treasury Board , is allegedly under investigation in this matter of influence peddling .

Mr. Speaker , I listened to the compassion in the speech of the member for Kamloops as he talked about the people living at the poverty line , the unemployed and the seniors who are scraping to get buy .
the Speaker :
the Chair heard the member for Calgary Southeast refer to stealing in an abstract manner .
thousands of donations and boxes full of food and clothing arrived to help fellow Canadians .
the Conservative Party is merely trying to deflect the implication of Pierre Corbeil who happens to be the brother of an ex - Conservative minister .
if young Canadians knew that each dollar they put into CPP would go into their own personal account and that they would receive it all back , including a fair market return on their investment , they would gladly support the plan .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
they are silent .
multilateral AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT
the leader of the official opposition was not the only one to comment on the Calgary declaration over the weekend , as Quebec Liberals stated that , as far as they were concerned , the Calgary declaration was not enough , that it needed to be fleshed out .
by so doing , the big guns in the federalist camp are endorsing the position of the leader of the official opposition , who stubbornly denies the existence of the people of Quebec as one of the two founding nations of Canada in 1867 .
older Canadians want secure income support in retirement .
the data that I have seen most recently indicated that arbitration tends to tilt in favour of labour .
what is behind this political decision by the minister -
breaking down trade barriers , both within Canada and around the world , helps ensure markets for Canadian goods and services and provides the best opportunity for greater prosperity .
but I am no longer part of that group .
the legislation also includes provisions for adding additional grains to the marketing mandate of the Canadian Wheat Board .
these changes usher in a new era of accountability and flexibility within the Canadian Wheat Board , ensuring that it is well positioned to compete with in the global marketplace as the dawn of a new millennium approaches .
i was pleased to see this type of co - operation during the unfortunate crises of the floods in Quebec and Manitoba .

i wonder how many members know that there are more than 30,000 illegals under deportation order in this country right now .

Mr. Ren 茅 Canuel ( Matap 茅 dia - Matane , BQ ) :

when there are no easy answers forthcoming on the issue of the day , it has been said that federal politics is conflict resolution at the national level but it is also taking care of the business of the country in a wise manner for the long term welfare of future generations , not short term special interests or for only those who currently have the inside track .

it was very chaotic .
i would have preferred to talk about good news this week .
dear colleagues , in my opinion , this question is out of order .
it is generally known that businesses in Quebec , in Canada and in North America were foreign owned .
we argue very vigorously that that simply has not happened , and government members are not paying attention to the priorities of Canadians .
we believe it has historically played a role in Quebec and we look to a future that includes the anglophone community .
it is also surprising that the matter was not submitted to cabinet to ensure government integrity .
but I wonder whether the Liberal members are redundant .
the Government will also work with the provinces and territories to establish the National Re - Investment Framework to guide the re - allocation of our partners ' savings into new services and benefits for low - income families with children .
the Canada pension plan will be there for members of the House , for young people , for young workers , for my children , for my children ' s children .

one of my priorities in the last Parliament was to make sure that the views of my constituents were well understood and well represented to the government on pension reform .

i thank the voters of Whitby - Ajax for the trust they have shown in me and assure them that I will do my utmost to dignify their choice with tireless work , constant communication and faithful representation .
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the hon. member to the House .
exactly 17 years later to the day , on October 11 , 1979 , my predecessor rose in this House to deliver his first speech .
now , that is novel for the government to hear , tax relief .
through the Canadian Wheat Board all sales are deposited in one of four pool accounts , wheat , durum wheat , feed barley or designated barley .
president OF THE TREASURY BOARD
the Reform Party is spreading all kinds of myths , for example that government programs are the cause of large deficits in this country .
Mr. Tremblay always had an attentive ear to the needs of his fellow citizens of Rosemont - Petite - Patrie .
we would love to be able to put more efforts into training .
what is the Canadian government doing to protect Canadians travelling abroad ?
report OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL OF CANADA
some hon. members :
as the prime minister told the House , it is unacceptable to the Government of Canada for anybody authorized by a foreign government to use Canadian passports to perpetrate an illegal act .
the government ' s policy of attempting to control our economy by manipulating interest rates must be questioned .
you will forgive me for not believing what the government says about the benefits of reform .
as for the directors and officers of the Canadian wheat board they will naturally be required to abide by the law .
i will talk about a number of these anomalies , these complications they had .
canada PENSION PLAN
Mr. Speaker , I am certainly disappointed that my hon. colleague feels that there is going to be a strike .
a fisheries minister from British Columbia fails to support the province in its salmon problems .
yes , Mr. Speaker .
Mr. Speaker , thank you very much .
i also pay homage to my wife and children for the immeasurable love and support that they have given me over the years and particularly during this venture into what for me is a new , exciting and challenging world of politics .
not at all .
why does that member not meet the same challenge ?
it is the willingness to share and ensure equality of access to national programs and not necessarily equality of powers that makes Canada unique .
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Anjou - Rivi 猫 re - des - Prairies , Lib . ) :
non - compliance may result in the recipient ' s having to repay the grant .
history will show that Jim Jordan was a politician who clearly cared more for the public than he ever did about public relations .
i know the hon. member will be by my side and will say that Quebecers are a people , that they form a nation , that Quebec has a right to self - determination , and that its territory must remain intact .
we do banter back and forth here but we try to stay for the most part away from personal comments that are meant to be slighted to the -
what will the government ' s stance be at the multilateral agreement on investment negotiations ?
Mr. Speaker , I in turn would like to join my colleagues who have just spoken in paying tribute to Alistair Fraser , who , as has been pointed out in the last few minutes , was Clerk of the House of Commons from 1967 to 1979 .
if the government really wants to develop this industry and encourage creativity , it must immediate review the Copyright Act , for the audiovisual sector was excluded from the recent revision of that legislation .
these are important questions .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the question from my colleague .
in fact , this is just the logical continuation of a long federal offensive to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction .
thank you , Mr. Speaker , for recognizing me on a point of order arising from question period .
going through August and September I watched the polls changing .
just two days ago the government in the throne speech committed itself to " develop relationships with aboriginal peoples based on the principles of partnership , transparency , predictability and accountability '' .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
the bill does not include anything that would take the Canadian Wheat Board toward being a voluntary organization .
i have watched the people on this reserve for 30 years .
in the last three budgets of the Minister of Finance these federal transfers were cut by more than $ 6 billion .
for example , the Ontario soya bean growers marketing board received $ 387,000 for 17 projects for the corn producers too .
this the government intends to do by using money cut from transfers to the provinces for health , education and welfare and money saved at the expense of ordinary citizens : the unemployed , workers , seasonal workers , the sick , students and welfare recipients .
i bet a dime no one can guess .
since this is not a constitutional or legal text , I would urge Canadians not to be drawn into a legalistic analysis of a statement of values .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
i would like to thank him for the legacy he has left in the riding .
the bureaucrats kept on feeding him and tending to his every gurgle , burp and expansion .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
my wife and I have had very fond experiences there .
if the feds did agree , we would like to have a copy of that decision because in the agreement it says that all decisions will be in writing .
this says " Liberal fax transmission from Jean Chr 茅 tien to Terry Mercer , National Director , Liberal Party of Canada '' , and it says Prime Minister ' s office at the top .
those are just two things .
the words that have been used here today are , at a minimum , contemptuous of the Supreme Court of Canada but they also potentially undermine the entire legal system in this country .
nevertheless there are many major things , like the Young Offenders Act , capital punishment and various bills that came through here last year on sentencing reforms on which the public should have had more meaningful input .
Mr. Speaker , I have new and relevant information on this issue .
we could not have relied on the official opposition or even the third party in the last Parliament to have raised such matters because they all bow down to the same altar of the multinational corporations and the global economic order that was created for the benefit of investors , and to hell with the workers and everybody else .
members opposite blame our tax system .
in fact , our intentions were not expressed only in the throne speech .
the member for T 茅 miscamingue talked about big banks and contributions , but he forgot to mention the caisses populaires in Quebec , $ 1,5 million from small investors for the Bloc Quebecois ' s election campaign in Quebec .
will this program alone solve our unity problems ?
* * *
the proposed amendments to Bill C - 2 raise questions as to the amount of money the current government can pull from the pockets of the middle class when at the same time it is cutting future retirement benefits .
i have a lot of respect for the hon. member opposite .
all that will be left of the federal government presence in the north will be a new but empty federal building with no workers to provide flood warnings , extreme weather warnings or aviation services .
one way of ensuring protection for peace officers , indeed all Canadians , is to ensure individuals convicted of first degree murder do not receive early release .
here is how to improve them '' .
this is clearly difficult for Canadians .
it is the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne so I will try to make my remarks pertinent to the throne speech itself .
that adds up to a tax burden of $ 3,518 in taxes per year or $ 295 each and every month for every Canadian taxpayer .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
they continued by saying that large increases in payroll taxes , like UI premiums , CPP and QPP contributed to escalating labour costs over this period .
i think of the member for Surrey North , himself a victim of crime with the murder of his son , and how he has struggled and fought to get to this House so he could represent victims .
Quebecers are increasingly aware of what goes on here and can count on the 44 members of the Bloc Quebecois , who will be here every day , in every debate , to reveal the pretence and go beyond appearances , to show people what really goes on here , even though that may not be to the liking of the other side of the House .
Mr. Jim Hart
Mr. Speaker , I also join with other MPs in paying tribute to the late Stanley Knowles .
the throne speech led us to expect government legislation during the 36 th Parliament on proposed changes to the Canada pension plan , the new seniors benefit , a national child benefit system , the Canadian Labour Code , as well as new programs for people with disabilities , youth training , education and employment , expanding opportunities for aboriginals and health care .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
the third honour I had was when the Reform leader asked me to be the chief agricultural critic in the official opposition shadow cabinet .
it occurred to me that it was simply a more stilted and formal version of the 56 page red book II , the one that we released ahead of the Prime Minister .
i would like to quote the finance minister .
i also wish to thank the constituents and the people of Sackville - Eastern Shore , a new riding in Nova Scotia , who elected me and gave me their trust and honour and privilege to represent them in this House of Commons .
twenty - seven out of twenty - eight Nunavut communities are coastal communities but all are serviced only by air .
Mr. Speaker , in the Speech from the Throne the government indicated that it would help small and medium size enterprises develop and commercialize new techniques .
it is a deprecation of the quality of debate in the House to hear him talk like that .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis
we heard . "
rather than condemning the government , and Bill C - 2 because it wants annual reports , the Leader of the Opposition missed an opportunity for valid criticism and he has left it again to the government backbenchers to warn the government that it has not fully examined the bill .
there have been any number of instances of that over the past number of years .
infrastructure
this government makes partisan decisions , such as the one to relocate an employment centre for some good friends .
a second reality is the consequences of Canada ' s federal debt .
these volunteers have dedicated themselves to the duty of citizenship that helps advance humanity forward .
comments about the new Canada pension plan startle me because they say that many of them are not going to be able to continue to operate and to pay these taxes .
we have to target and improve the capability of aboriginal communities to support themselves .
i would ask the member for Rosemont what he would like most to be achieved at the end of this mandate so that , when he leaves Parliament , he can say " mission accomplished " to all Quebeckers .
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) :
it does not consider growth in population .
he worked very diligently for the people in New Brunswick .
madam Speaker , I would like to ask my distinguished colleague , the hon. member for Berthier - Montcalm , to go back in time and tell us about the nine years that preceded the arrival in office of the Liberal Party .
a diverse combination of small and medium size businesses provides services in key industrial areas such as manufacturing , retail and wholesale trade , business and health and social services .
it is wrong , very wrong for someone to go around a constituency and make promises that if " you vote for me , I will make sure I look after you . "
then under three subsequent budgets we reduced the EI contributions , once , twice , three times .
could the minister please explain why we have ended that program ?
( motion agreed to )
Mr. Speaker , Health Canada officials covered up the truth .
the members of the Reform did not support those items -
i have two questions for him .
why does the Prime Minister not make this his big millennium project and put a million and a half Canadians back to work so they can join in the celebration ?
the people of Canada are the ones who will have to live with these changes .
this throne speech is worth nothing .
highways are the responsibility of the provinces .
it is important for Canadians to understand that there were changes made in the 1989 legislation that allowed more people to qualify for CPP and increased the flat rate .
reform is generally supportive of the establishment of a parliamentary committee to study the proposed resolution and amendment and to report to the House .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
George ' s .
Mr. Speaker , we now know for a fact that the RCMP visited the Liberal Party headquarters .
it could make the difference between life and death .
the Deputy Speaker :
to quote an internationalist you know very well , Emmerich De Vattel :
an area of 1.9 million square kilometres certainly brings a new meaning to door to door at election time .
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
this is a track record that we cannot ignore because clearly it is creating benefits that we cannot forgo .
and we managed to do this because both levels of government , federal and provincial , are learning to work together and to concentrate on the areas for which they are responsible .
* * *
have we changed infrastructures ?
that is simply unacceptable .
first , the law should require all bail hearings in crimes of violence to be presided over by a judge .
that is where things are at today .
to describe the size of our debt more graphically , a financial analyst in the 1995 Grant ' s Interest Rate Observer said that 8 percent of Canada ' s land mass is covered in water while the other 92 percent is covered in debt .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
no , it was done by increasing the tax burden on Canadian families , by killing jobs , by increasing payroll taxes .
there is no doubt that the decisions made by this government have had an impact on child poverty and made parents poorer .
i want congratulate you on your appointment as an officer of the House .
i do not need to remind anybody that , in under two months , this same government will be representing Canada and Quebec at the international conference on greenhouse gases in Kyoto .
there are two difficulties with the infrastucture .
and by replacing the words " November 7 " with the words " the last sitting day in December '' .
Quebec is attractive to foreign investors , and there is nothing the federalists can do about it .
issues related to youth crime including the victimization of young people , the most vulnerable members of our society , will continue as a priority in my ministry .
we understand that , we know it and we support it .
madam Speaker , I listened to the member for Calgary Southeast .
i would ask hon. members to keep their questions and responses short .
we spend less on social programs than most developed nations .
we have diamonds in the north .
hon. Ralph E . Goodale
we have to explore the strategies of own source of revenues and taxation .
they want to postpone .
this is after we have paid for their education .
Mr. Speaker , another member from the province of Premier Harris , who claims to recognize Quebec as unique in the same way the Pacific salmon is unique .
these are the goals that our caucus hopes to reach .
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Orders 104 and 114 and pursuant to the order adopted by the House on Wednesday , October 1 , 1997 , I have the honour to present the second report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs regarding the membership of various committees , and I should like to move concurrence at this time .
in particular , in spite of his pronunciation , I appreciated the few words he said in French .
* * *
OKTOBERFEST
we have new Canadians , refugees who need help to adjust .
if I were living in downtown Toronto or Oakville , Ontario I would agree 100 percent with what the member has stated .
more difficult you see
yet we know from Mr. Amerasinghe ' s diary notes and from an e - mail dated March 1 , 1996 addressed to Mr. John Sims from Mr. Amerasinghe both these men knew of Thompson ' s letter six days before it was forwarded to counsel .
i also want to pay tribute and express my thanks to the people of Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough for entrusting in me this very sacred responsibility .
yet the government ' s ethics counsellor works quietly , behind closed doors .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
that is very interesting coming from a party whose leader is now living in Stornoway where he promised he would never live , but that he would turn it into a bingo hall rather than live there .
we can find no greater evidence than in the words of the throne speech .
therefore , we will not follow the advice of the leader of the New Democratic Party .
i would remind him that the signature on the preface to the book written by Mr. Bastarache in 1986 was that of Jean Chr 茅 tien .
Mr. Gordon Earle
really now !
Mr. Speaker , I too would like to join with colleagues in the House of Commons to pay tribute to Claude Ellis .
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) :
it is like the EI .
we do not have to have a decrease in disability benefits or in survivor benefits .
they ask that Parliament confirm that Canada ' s boundaries can only be resolved either by a free vote of all Canadians or through amending the Constitution by means of the amending formula .
of the 15 board of directors who have been identified , all 15 should be elected by the producers , not appointed by government .
yet , some newspapers and political parties persist in their use of the singular form .
i thank them for their strong vote of confidence and I promise to do everything I can to perform my duties with honesty during this 36 th Parliament of Canada .
hear , hear .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis
it is this second element , economic development and growth to ensure better revenues , that is lacking in the case of the investment board .
he stated that the Liberal Party was required to comply with the Criminal Code .
i think I have made my point that the ultimate intent of the bill before us though regrettably not stated is to care for people and to provide income to allow people to care for themselves .
foreign AFFAIRS
three hundred modern - day war criminals are reported to have gained entry and are living in Canada .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano :
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) :
* * *
in order to give the committee more time to do its work , we will propose an amendment to the government motion that the committee make its final report no later than the last sitting day in December .
the Liberal government has demonstrated the flexibility and vigour of Canadian federalism .
at the same time increasing numbers of Canadians are living in poverty , increasing numbers of people are losing their jobs , their businesses and their homes .
having outlined those three tests , and I could say a lot more on each of them but I have said enough already , I would now like to make a preliminary application of those tests to the amendment that has been put forward by the Quebec assembly .
Mr. Peter MacKay
health
" we would never do that " stated the minister .
it must be several thousands , but if I answer their questions , I will not be able to go on with my speech .
since that time Toronto has grown out over top of the riding .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
why ?
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
in every single province except Alberta , the majority of voters rejected the cuts to programs and services .
in our first mandate we began the work of dealing with youth unemployment .
criminal Code
speech FROM THE THRONE
it is a matter of how one rebuilds one ' s house .
comments DURING QUESTION PERIOD
cut taxes .
we may not ever remove the problem of prostitution from our society , but the law changed and capacity creates its own demand .
we would impose no new taxes and no new spending cuts , and we will not .
i cannot think of a better testament to the government ' s determination to find a solution with broad based support .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
in the near future we will be faced with competition from gambling facilities in the city of Detroit .
the number of people from all across Canada who phoned , who travelled to Manitoba to help out , who came in to volunteer was really quite overwhelming .
bill C - 224 .
canada ELECTIONS ACT
for the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board to suggest that this bill is going to make it more accountable is actually ludicrous .
bill C - 223 .
if they are acting in good faith and within the scope of their employment , then they would have the same protection under common law as would employees of private corporations .
about one - third of those who would vote yes for separation thought they were equivalent , whereas 55 % of those who would vote no said they were equivalent .
he was a CCF member , someone who undoubtedly did some very useful work in the Parliament of Canada and who spared no effort in serving his fellow citizens in the Regina area .
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau :
hon. John Manley
second , it is important to note that not all francophones are in favour of linguistic school boards .
we debated it for one day .
bill C - 243 .
what do we discover ?
since the hon. member will have the opportunity to ask a supplementary question , will he stand in the House now and tell us how much the Reform cost premiums will be ?
the Government of Quebec believes , and we agree , that a strong enough consensus has developed and that the amendment only concerns Quebec and the federal government . Therefore , we would rather have done without the joint committee .
it is interesting that kind of information is public , open and available to all .
DNA IDENTIFICATION ACT
when the leader of the Conservative Party asked if he would have a couple or three minutes to do the same , we are now into doubling the time allotted for his speech .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
they will be doing a report and will be reporting when it is available .
moreover , he is the federal minister responsible for the province , an interested party , as the hon. Minister of Human Resources Development was saying .
we must assume one of two things .
the Chamber has always been the custodian of minority rights .
the Government will continue to work with provinces to ensure greater mobility for people with disabilities and to ensure their integration into the economic and social mainstream of Canadian life .
it is my pledge to them today to continue to build on the experience that I gained during the last Parliament , to continue to work as hard as they do and continue to work toward my goal of becoming the best MP possible in representing my constituents here in Ottawa .
there has been an evolution of thought in the country over the last number of years and people want more input .
i am getting so sick and tired of hearing the Liberals talk about their financial success .
bill C - 204 .
ground stocks in Atlantic Canada are not regenerating .
the debt is on a downward track and the government has made a commitment to reduce the debt as a ratio to the GDP .
Mr. Stan Keyes
my bill would make sure that any money given specifically to the crown to pay down the debt would have to stay in trust until such time as there were surpluses , then it could be used to pay down the debt .
the number is so big that it is difficult for people actually listening today to get a sense of what it is .
he is waking up after nine years .
we should be very concerned .
i believe that this government ' s courage in solving problems by addressing needs , not only for the next few years but for the next generations needs to be recognized .
i agree wholeheartedly with his comments about the Reform proposals .
it is a very valuable entry into the workforce .
this is clear from the recent election .
we now have an undertaking from the leader of the Government in the House .
* * *
madam Speaker , I want to add my own congratulations to you on your appointment as one of our deputy speakers and look forward to your very fair and impartial judgments on our deliberations .
the farmers spoke .
imagine , the crossing guards , the people who are entrusted to protect our most precious loved ones , our children , are not being paid a living wage .
as a former crown prosecutor I do agree with the line that the government should not directly partake in an RCMP investigation .
i wonder if we could have the unanimous consent of the House to extend this period of questioning for a few more minutes because we cannot let him off this easy .
nearly 30 years ago the prime minister promised aboriginals " full social , economic and political participation in Canadian life '' .
today we heard the Reform party attack everything we are doing .
that is the whole philosophy of the Reform Party .
regarding old age security and the guaranteed income supplement , the government announced in its 1996 budget that it would replace these two measures by a single seniors benefit .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
as far as the timetable is concerned , it really falls within the responsibilities of the Minister of Transport in terms of his responsibility to provide the security of those airports .
because he did not want the public to know that the federal government ' s finances were in better shape than he was letting on , and this was how he justified cutting assistance to the most disadvantaged , to the elderly , the ill , students and those on welfare .
it will take time to phase in this plan but we have to start it now .
and this letter is signed by Mr. and Mrs. B 茅 liveau of Rock Forest .
there is perhaps a point of order that could be made were it to be in the same Parliament , but it is not even that .
the small businessman is going to be put further down the line and his chances of survival are that much less .
the government was to fund the provinces 50:50 when medicare came in in 1965 .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
the polling booths are now open .
the administration of disability benefits will be further improved .
they asked for better financing of the plan .
Mr. Speaker , I can say it very clearly because I was not informed .
and yet our communities , whether on the coasts or the prairies , whether in the woodlands or on the northern tundra , show the same friendliness , openness , and generosity .
maybe the auditor general does not accept that as a move in the right direction but we think that is a long way down the road to restructuring an industry that has totally collapsed .
it is a marvellous submission for the next millennium .
* * *
they date back to the first red book , which called for the creation of a national forum on health , raising objections from all of the provinces because they had no representation on it .
we do not need some vague promise about a scholarship fund in the millennium which will not help students who are in grave difficulty today .
* * *
i am here today by the grace of God , by the support of my husband and family , and the commitment and hard work of many volunteers and friends .
Mr. Speaker , the public has a right to know what is happening in defence headquarters .
moreover in its own documents the government admits that there can never be absolute guarantees that the 9.9 percent rate is the highest the rate will ever go .
the Reform Party attempts to make an issue of sustainability with regard to the changes to the CPP and the program being in place in the future .
it is where I helped raise a family and where my heart is .
Mr. Speaker , will the minister defend her department staff and mandate from the finance minister ' s destructive financial policies ?
i declare the amendment defeated .
hon. Don Boudria
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
Mr. Preston Manning
we have examples already , with the announcement by the Prime Minister of a $ 1 billion merit scholarship fund .
Mr. Peter Mancini :
i saw Sharon the other day because I was looking for Daphne , another lady who was very kind to me .
the Liberal government has said that we would meet or exceed deficit targets , and we will .
we will build creative partnerships between the private and public sectors to accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies in all sectors of the economy '' .
Mr. Speaker , let me take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment as Acting Speaker of the House of Commons .
the conditions under which people live determine , to a large extent , their health , productivity and sense of well - being .
hon. John Manley
the third test relates to the national interest .
Mr. Alex Shepherd ( Durham , Lib . ) :
this is the second time this bill has been presented to the House .
i cannot believe that he could stand up here and say this .
he is talking about bribes .
Mr. Speaker , my question surrounds the contradictions that seem to exist .
bill C - 72 was introduced in December 1996 but the legislation was soon overtaken by events .
i do think , though , that the federal government has an ability to track these kinds of outcomes and be able to set some standards that all provinces can then set as true accountability for their performance .
and where is she now ?
we won a majority government , something that has not happened that often in this country .
it represents something that would have a dramatic effect on our economy if it were left as it is .
this will ensure that the funds invested in provincial securities is consistent with market practice .
Quebecers will do exactly what they did to every other meaningless offer they received concerning Quebec ' s future and reject it out of hand .
need I go on about the tragic plight of women in the most beautiful country in the world and the best country in the world to live in ?
is the minister satisfied that all options , such as project relocation , have been explored to ensure that the ecosystem impacts are minimized and , at the same time , protecting important jobs in the area ?
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the Minister of Human Resources Development , and I noticed the tone he used .
Mr. Preston Manning
when his MP pension plan is about $ 2 million and my farmers are starving , where is the accountability ?
first , it was the system of gathering information put together by Health Canada that allowed the auditor general to come up with the analysis in his report .
instead we will refer the whole matter of regulating these products to the health committee .
Mr. Janko Peric ( Cambridge , Lib . ) :
* * *
i am very fortunate to claim both Stanley Knowles and David Orlikow as my predecessors , two longstanding parliamentarians who made a real difference .
long live a united and strong Canada .
a major problem with this program is that the minister can and often does automatically appeal any decision below the appeals board level .
in my riding of Tobique - Mactaquac , more specifically school district 12 , progress was being made .
we as a government have always believed and will continue to believe that we need to invest in the future of Canadians and ensure that the investments pay dividends .
two - thirds of the people have spoken , the barley producers .
i wonder if he is aware of the deplorable conditions on this reserve in my riding .
like all ridings across Canada , jobs are at the forefront of the constituents ' minds in Simcoe - Grey .
we all know we could become disabled .
business OF THE HOUSE
when we are in sight of the goal of balancing the budget , this government is willing to throw away all the sacrifices Canadians have made .
i cannot remember .
i personally believe that a good starting point in putting a new face on politics and showing the world that we mean business is by maintaining proper decorum and respect not just outside the walls of the House of Commons but , more importantly , inside the walls of this place where we conduct the nation ' s business .
thousands of years ago , Aboriginal people began building Canada ' s first communities .
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
is it the prime minister ' s intention to govern parliament by closure ?
hon. Lucienne Robillard
there are very few job opportunities in those rural communities in Atlantic Canada and the Atlantic groundfish strategy expires a year early in May 1998 .
there are individuals who pay very high taxes , while other do not pay any because of all the loopholes in our tax system , which has not undergone a complete overhaul in 30 years .
hybrid TURKEYS
however there is still a backlog at the pension appeals board level .
it is the sort of praise that is used when one wants to bury the cause for which these men fought .
community ACCESS
oral QUESTION PERIOD
it is at the point now that in some sectors we are missing the skills and the professional ability to carry forward the research application that needs to be done .
a great and vigorous country where democracy flourishes , without sacrificing minority rights , a country where citizens can move freely , a country where everyone can speak freely without fear of persecution , a country that is the envy of the world .
this is something Canadians are not aware of .
these chaplains are trained to teach and handle issues arising from different religions .
Mr. Paul Forseth
madam Speaker , may I have the permission of the Bloc Quebecois to hand my props to the clerk ?
answer his question .
i am pleased that the throne speech contains a reference to the people who day after day carry out the work of the Government of Canada .
our federation as we know it is flexible .
madam Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member for his question .
frank MCKENNA
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
could the member comment on what he defines as chequebook politics ?
it airs the mind , tunes the nerves and scours the soul '' .
those plans are doing better than the government pension plan .
investing in Knowledge and Creativity
this redundancy would undoubtedly lengthen the time that it would take for the two chambers to deal with the amendment .
in the 1990 s there has been a struggle between the old school and the new school .
Mr. Speaker , for us Quebecers , for those who share the idea that Quebec ought to become a sovereign country , it is the people who will be sovereign .
if any other members were subject to that sort of abuse in a campaign they will appreciate that it is not a very nice way to go .
Mr. G 茅 rard Asselin
the question once again is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans .
we are all confident you will do a great job .
however , I fear it might take the rest of the afternoon .
its primary responsibility will be to achieve the best possible rate of return , so that today ' s young people stand a better chance of enjoying a retirement pension .
by nationalizing private electric companies , we can not only have a more direct impact on energy prices in many parts of the province but also establish a crown corporation whose influence on industrial development is already remarkable .
we have two groups here , one group that increased taxes and another group that decreased taxes .
health
you be courteous enough to answer the question then .
in this year alone there have been 260,000 jobs , the majority of them in the private sector .
it is refundable and repayable to the federal government .
we must all be invigorated by our triumphs of the past , by the magic of the present and by our hopes and dreams of the future .
what about the fishery off my shore ?
hon. Paul Martin
i do not know if he is from my riding or another riding or from Montreal .
later next month we will be opening up an oenology and viticulture institute at Brock University , an excellent endeavour for the university , its students , its grape growers and the wine industry .
if the government was really wise , it would make a suggestion that it will spend perhaps 50 % of the savings made by cutting out these ridiculous expenditures .
there is nothing sadder than seeing youth resort to crime in the absence of hope for their future .
all benefits now and in the future will remain fully indexed to inflation .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motions ?
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member ' s assertion is incorrect .
they cannot hold one to a dozen that we have , so they should not tell me that we are not representing farmers .
significant changes need to be made in mining regulations , and environmental regulations need to be streamlined if mineral exploration is to flourish .
if that is a minor adjustment , I would like to hear the hon. member ' s definition of a substantial increase .
after all , this constitutional amendment , which would allow the government of Quebec to change the very foundations of its education system , was made possible by the patriation of the Constitution .
but we will have to wait and see what happens in the provinces , which are working on this right now .
he talked specifically of help to Atlantic Canada .
by rising to the challenge of mobilizing our resources well , we can enable our citizens to succeed in the global knowledge - based economy .
see what is going to happen .
why then would the government encourage the practice of making new promises of dispensing taxpayers ' dollars which gives an incentive for individuals and companies to invest in seeking those dollars rather than in technological innovation ?
this House has the power to pass that bill whether the provinces agree with it or not .
i question the point of sending the bill to committee if the government is already showing its indifference to any other opinion but its own by shutting down debate .
in the light of yesterday ' s Supreme Court remarks regarding Isaac and Jerome , I have also written to the Canadian Judicial Council requesting a more thorough review of Chief Justice Isaac ' s actions as well as an examination of the conduct of Associate Chief Justice Jerome as referenced in the justice department documents filed in the Supreme Court of Canada .
my constituents have now been put in the position of being fearful for their lives .
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Brossard - La Prairie , Lib . ) :
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
Mr. Michel Gauthier
Dauphin - Swan River is located in west central Manitoba , the second largest settled area riding .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅
Mr. Speaker , first I would like to compliment the Prime Minister on his major diplomatic achievement at Madrid at the NATO meeting where he was able to secure an agreement .
the Deputy Speaker :
my constituents are my priority and I promise never to lose sight of that .
surely to goodness she is part of a people and that people is Canada .
follows They should be held accountable for what they say .
i would say you have mastered the rules of procedure and you are very diplomatic in your skills and in handling numbers .
therefore , we really cannot hold the government accountable to its promise unless we know that for a fact .
in the world of global trade and investment , Canada has come of age .
Mr. Speaker , I am informed that the Minister of Foreign Affairs is in touch at this moment with the Government of Jordan and the Government of Israel .
to deal with the present there is a third party , Coopers & Lybrand , that is managing the day to day operations of the First Nation .
it is important to separate out the kinds of squabbles that are occurring right now which do not benefit our young people .
will they look after them ?
as I said , Parliament will want to assure itself that the passage of the proposed Quebec amendment or the Newfoundland amendment in no way establishes a precedent prejudicially affecting minority rights in other provinces .
the Speaker :
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
breast CANCER
like the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords , in my opinion the Calgary declaration does not contain the elements which would allow Quebecers to live with a Canadian federalism based on the equality of provinces and individuals rather than on the recognition and freedom of peoples .
i have a question for him with which I want to preface some of my remarks .
good business conditions is what they are looking for .
is it the policy of this minister and government that severely disabled Canadians who contract home care services are in fact running businesses and will be dragged through the courts and encounter personal financial hardship to satisfy this government ' s insatiable desire for tax dollars ?
now , thanks to a strong and fiscally responsible government , we have provided a stable and strong economic environment to allow these industries to rebuild and strengthen their positions in Canadian and world markets .
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau : - the most obsessive .
resumption of debate on the Address in Reply
to force closure on this issue eight hours into the debate in a brand new Parliament sets a precedent which I believe will resonate throughout the entire mandate .
this plan does not come anywhere close .
it has a constructive role to play as a partner with provinces and other interested parties .
i am pleased to raise this bill again in the House and I look forward to getting the support again from all hon. members .
we believe in a triple - E Senate where the Senate is equal , elected and effective .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
i thank the constituents of West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast for sending me back .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
we must equip our children with the capacities they need to be ready to learn and to participate fully in our society .
to be sure , the Conquest , 150 years later , enriched the culture of the people who were already there and who were already considering themselves a people .
oh , oh .
first , hundreds of thousands of jobs did disappear and many such jobs disappeared from the ranks of the large corporations that said in 1987 that free trade meant more jobs .
i was there at their request and was trying to serve on their behalf .
of course , in the eyes of the Liberal government , there is no such thing as a Quebec culture .
i also pay tribute to members of the Bloc and the Reform Party for having the good sense to join us in this open debate concerning government accountability .
in fact their framework for discussion listed the word equality five times .
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the member ' s question .
oh , oh .
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan ( Winnipeg North - St.
is this his idea of extensive debate ?
our journey to fiscal responsibility and economic renewal has been a very difficult one .
we have seen the Reform Party members stand in this House and try to give a little history lesson as it has been rewritten by the Reform Party , not quite going back to the dirty thirties where there were no marketing boards working co - operatively to market farmers ' grains in this country .
Mr. Scott Brison
Mr. Flis , we salute , thank and applaud you .
in pursuing this politically motivated goose chase he embarrassed himself , embarrassed the justice department , embarrassed the RCMP , embarrassed the House and cost taxpayers millions of dollars .
given that the auditor general refers to the status of aboriginal health as a tragedy and a crisis , what concrete steps is this government going to take to ensure proper accountability for the $ 1 billion that is spent every year on aboriginal health care ?
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
however , some of the Bloc members here in this House today have received corporate contributions .
this is what is at the very root of this question .
taxation
i would ask him to consider withdrawing and speaking in a more temperate fashion about our high court .
we want to be constructive .
does he realize that even the most modest demands from Quebec ' s federalists place the bar so high that the premiers of the other provinces cannot make it over ?
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
does the member condemn our efforts and our tax cuts to help students by making more of their fees deductible and by giving greater tax breaks to parents who invest in registered educational savings plans ?
yesterday the minister moved in the direction of privatizing the administration of the Canada pension plan through the creation of a fund of $ 100 billion to be managed by his friends on Bay Street , those boys in red suspenders .
i will try to spell out some of those issues .
Mr. Speaker , I ask that all questions be allowed to stand .
he repeated that request today .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion :
that is now not the case .
i do not think this is funny .
division No. 8
the Prime Minister was aware that there were serious suspicions about a Liberal Party organizer .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye
almost one million jobs have been created since 1993 . Our economic growth is expected to be the best of the G - 7 countries this year .
order .
does she know what the Liberal government did from day one until now ?
protecting our environment is important to all of us and it is a matter of concern for Quebeckers .
neither your political representatives , Liberal , Conservative , Reform or NDP , nor the judges of the Supreme Court will change anything .
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
two major funding tools exist for providing that funding .
also , seniors will receive on an annual basis a statement on the state of health of the Canada pension plan .
the Government of Canada is doing its share , but if the Bouchard government continues to represent the interests of the separatists only , Quebecers will never reap the benefits .
as part of the process , we are obliged to use the amending formula , a bilateral formula .
that is the road proposed by the Bloc Quebecois to continue putting our fiscal house in order as well as to help create jobs through targeted reductions in corporate tax .
that means more flexibility in registered retirement savings plan .
Mr. Jean Dub 茅
i heard the member for Kelowna talk about investments in the technology partnership program .
there is no vision for the people .
according to our traditions and practices , the Chair does not intervene in the proceedings of a committee unless a problem has been reported by the committee to the House or in extremely unusual circumstances .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mrs. Carolyn Parrish
that having been said , when we hear that being as unique as Pacific salmon is the same thing as distinct society , we might well wonder .
today is not the first time they are being told that education is none of their business .
they put power in the hands of producers , allowing them to shape the Canadian Wheat Board to the needs of Canadian farmers .
criminal CODE
we have , of course , seen the Liberal government take firm action to ensure that the federal government spends within its means .
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) :
the members of the New Democratic Party sat on the committee and recommended the changes we are living under now .
if this is an example of how the government spends its money , we have reason to believe that the government is going to blow it out the door once again .
the private sector has also been most encouraging .
i am not ashamed to say this .
as John Wright from Angus Reid has said , the tax cutter bus has ended up an express bus with no destination .
third , an improved survivor benefit .
Ms. Val Meredith
it is now time to acknowledge the diverging views of the peoples of Quebec and Canada on the nature and structure of the federation .
to keep the current benefit structure , the chief actuary has told us that we will need to increase contributions to 14 percent of income by the year 2030 .
in Canada there are more than 400,000 teachers .
Mr. Speaker , my question is also to the Minister of Finance .
transition JOB FUND
Mr. Paul Forseth
one issue which stands out in my memory happened in 1990 when we were involved in the Meech Lake debate .
i have always tried to be consistent on the primary reason I was elected .
i represented him and his wife Bessie in the 1993 to 1997 term .
the hon. member for Yukon .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand
i encourage all Canadians to join Kitchener - Waterloo in this great celebration .
we have minimized the impact of these changes on vulnerable Canadians .
however , I would prefer that we use words that are less inflammatory .
the CPP will continue to be affordable .
it ' s a fish story .
Mr. Wayne Easter :
Mr. Jason Kenney :
madam Speaker , the member opposite sounds like Tartuffe who said : " Hide thy bosom from mine eyes '' .
we need job creation initiatives , we need lower taxes , we need to get people back to work .
we are familiar with how that system works .
in addition to this one - time endowment , the government will make further changes to the Canada Student Loans Programme and will increase assistance for students with dependents .
introduction and first reading
our plan covers people who leave the workforce temporarily to look after their children .
my colleague , the hon. member for Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , is right , they did worse .
a rebalancing of powers by defining which issues should be within the provincial government ' s jurisdiction and which should be in the federal government ' s jurisdiction would certainly go a long way to resolving many of the concerns of Quebeckers and British Columbians .
let us do just that .
an individual named Pierre Corbeil is being investigated at this time .
again I say to the minister that it is a good thing it is going to committee .
we have struggled to put aside the money we can to invest in our future years '' .
when we get the tax cuts the debate will be over where they should take place .
i will make sure that your company gets a grant . "
no , Mr. Speaker .
Mr. Speaker , today when we were making tributes today to Chester MacRae and to Claude Ellis , the House leader for the Liberal Party was screaming across the floor to those who were sitting here .
in the same vein , the $ 45 million in cuts made by the Liberal government have resulted in the National Film Board ' s virtually abandoning its assistance to independent film making , and this particularly jeopardizes the careers of the young film and video makers who represent the future of their industry .
although it is both absurd and disgusting , the reference to the Supreme Court aimed at depriving Quebecers of their right to decide their future democratically is not the real problem .
if we are , we can work together in a partnership , something we have offered to do since we came to this House .
we will continue with our safe homes and safe streets agenda which has helped us make solid gains in enhancing public safety .
i suggest that we continue with the answer of the hon. member for Athabasca .
that is not a fantasy nor is it a dream .
did you and do you still agree with these cuts that our people were subjected to in the regions ?
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis :
i wish I could spend a half a day talking about this absolute pile of waste , but I know that members opposite are bursting to ask me questions .
and the more they could be convinced that they do not have to choose between Quebec and Canada , that these two formidable entities can join forces and make them stronger and will be more indispensable to them than ever in the next millennium , the more they will turn away from the Bloc Quebecois in mistrust .
the throne speech sadly is a mere chart for interim crew duty on the ship of state and not a bold course for our ship to sail through the winds of change .
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) :
concerning this motion by the official opposition , it strikes me as a little bit hypocritical .
government ORDERS
this new riding is the result of major changes brought on by the readjustment of electoral boundaries .
my riding is a large rural riding with a very active and diverse agricultural sector and a thriving resource industry .
it is sad how little things have changed around here .
it was through his efforts and those of the present Clerk of the House of Commons that the Parliamentary Internship Programme was set up , providing an opportunity for numerous Canadians and Quebecers to work in this place for the representatives of the public , to achieve a better knowledge and understanding of this universally admired democratic institution , and to pass that knowledge and understanding on to others .
it is a modest reduction but nevertheless a reduction .
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) :
they make cash contributions .
in New Brunswick we are getting job creation at $ 6.25 an hour .
no , we do not hear a positive word from any one of them .
i would like to know if the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs agrees with the leader of the official opposition , who - must I remind the hon. members - is considered by the Prime Minister to be a key player in the debate on Canadian unity .
my colleagues before we begin oral questions , I would like to draw your attention to the presence in the gallery of Mr. Arthur Donahoe , Secretary General of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association .
canada PENSION PLAN
post - SECONDARY EDUCATION
it has been relying on the distinct society clause to move public opinion in Quebec , despite the fact that that has been tried before and despite the lack of support elsewhere in the country for that approach .
clearly I do not know exactly what role that plays in the debate , but he opened the door and I will try to get my rickety old body through it .
many Canadians see this security slipping away as we are crippled by debt , deficit , runaway programs , and waste and abuse of the resources of the country .
we know there is more room to grow for small and medium size businesses in the world of export .
the Deputy Speaker :
i have been here a long time and a politician in British Columbia a long time .
we have stabilized with funding to the centres d ' excellence .
i am totally opposed to the fact that we can be denied our right to an education that is tailored to the needs and aspirations of our community .
over the years he has served this House well with distinction and with honour .
customs does an incredible job .
the U.S. is pretty much committed to going to that plan within the next two years .
madam Speaker , since you are indicating that my time is up , let me conclude by hoping that the debates will be calm ones and that the wishes of the National Assembly will be respected .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
if they are to do what Canadians expect them to do , they must have the tools to do the job at a price we can afford .
the first beneficiaries of the CPP received benefits averaging over 11 times greater than the value of their contributions , while those entering the plan today will receive a return of less than one - half of the value of their contributions .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
let us deal with what is being said about some of the things we have done .
why , when he is squeezing every last nickel out of employers , employees , taxpayers and retirees , did he give a $ 1 billion break to Nav Canada ?
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
let us talk about the games the government is playing .
i was standing in my place .
will the minister commit here and now to show the leadership that is called for in the national action plan ?
it was still collecting money from the minister of multiculturalism when it had no mandate and no legal authority to exist .
how did we do that ?
it is not the fault of Atlantic Canadians if the fisheries are in a state of crisis .
hear , hear .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Bob Kilger
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
i heard the Prime Minister whistling another ditty yesterday .
hon. members opposite might wish to note that references to employees in provisions relating to the duty of care , duty to comply , limit of liability and indemnification have been deleted .
bill C - 245 .
we will remain committed to those needed programs .
Mr. Gary Pillitteri
we would still be in Europe .
the member talked about irresponsible spending .
we would increase CPP contribution rates to levels adequate to ensure the long - term viability of the plan .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
a member who is not in cabinet usually has little opportunity to influence legislation and other measures of policy .
on September 25 , the Minister of Finance tabled Bill C - 2 dealing with the Canada Pension Plan reform , among other things .
Mr. Speaker , I can neither confirm nor deny the allegations in the hon. member ' s question .
liberals strongly believe this fundamental foundation in security has served Canada well and will in the future .
yeas
they are going to continue at the current levels and they are going to continue to be indexed and they are going to continue to be there to protect them .
they should get that nonsense out of their heads .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , the Prime Minister made a very telling statement on the consultations to be held by the provinces on the Calgary declaration .
in light of this fact let me share with the House three trends which have developed among young Canadians , as well as what the Government of Canada is doing to help them along .
government ORDERS
multilateral Agreement on Investment
in the throne speech this government congratulated itself for its so - called economic recovery and for maintaining our social programs when in fact it is the same government that has slashed transfers to the provinces , cut EI benefits and failed to meet its commitments to the east coast fishers and has failed to address the concerns of our veterans from the merchant marine .
that fund is not even close to $ 200 billion , but politicians cannot keep their hands off even small funds .
hon. Don Boudria
the worst of it all is that I heard the Prime Minister himself say he did not know Michel Bastarache .
our plan would be open and transparent .
Ms. Val Meredith
that is fiscal responsibility .
Canadians have to take some responsibility for their own plans and the way to do that is by allowing them to participate .
if the government is serious about jobs for all Canadians in this new economy , it must now get serious about tax cuts and lower EI premiums as Canadians have earned this right .
it is incumbent on a national government to take on that role .
canada SUMMER GAMES
i am extremely proud of the thousands of Canadians who have chosen to participate .
this decision is fraught with consequences the Prime Minister will have to live with for years to come .
that is why , in the last budget , we announced the creation of a Canadian Foundation for Innovation .
we want them to have choices for transportation as much as possible .
very soon we will issue our response .
Mr. Peter Goldring :
you will have guessed that it has to do with the expression used in question period on which you intervened .
Mrs. Pauline Picard
it was not always the case .
anyone currently receiving CPP retirement pensions , disability benefits , survivor benefits or combined benefits will not see these benefits affected .
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will be working very closely with Minister of Human Resources Development providing fisheries advice to him and his officials on options as they are developed .
large as well as small and medium size firms , women entrepreneurs , Canadians of all origins and backgrounds , provinces , municipalities , educational institutions , all are on team Canada thereby giving Canadians a stake in every part of the world and every part of the world a stake in Canada .
it is scary when I hear Liberal members on the other side .
i wanted to talk a bit about the problems .
the problem with that is , as they should know , Treasury Board does not have the power to act .
we have learned also that the minister has instructed his lawyers to muzzle and intimidate Mr. Coffey to prevent him from making these allegations of fraud , nepotism and abuse public .
second , the Canada pension plan provides protection not available through private RRSPs such as disability benefits and survivor and death benefits .
this new private hospital is chomping at the bit to set up shop in Toronto , Edmonton and Vancouver .
the Speaker :
Mr. Lesage said , on June 9 , 1965 :
that is basically because in the start - up period that is exactly what was appropriate for that time .
Mrs. Maud Debien
the issue with the province of British Columbia is defence , the Nanoose base which we believe to be extraneous .
what is the minister waiting for to introduce legislation on money laundering , as the Bloc Quebecois has been asking for a long time , so as to , among other things , prevent anyone from being released before serving a full sentence ?
the time has come to show the world that Canada has writers , artists , directors and performers second to none , and that we can develop artistic endeavours here in Canada which will be produced all over the world .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅
if he asked his employees they would not see it unreasonable that 10 employees would see their premiums matched by the profit , just the profit on one of eight homes .
Mr. Speaker , I hear a lot of talk in the House today about wanting an actuarially sound plan .
the proposed changes have the support of the federal government and the provinces of Newfoundland , Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , Prince Edward Island , Quebec especially , Ontario , Manitoba and Alberta .
we want to hear witnesses .
we will continue to do that and as the government continues to improve and balance the budget and as funds become available for strategic investments , one of the priorities we have set forth is youth and we will continue to deal with that issue .
Canadians do not ask for the impossible .
Mr. Speaker , I can assure the hon. member that the dignity of veterans will be utmost and top priority for the government .
the federal government has also worked with the Niagara young people under the youth internship program , providing skills and experience for youth in jobs in the wine industry .
let me go through some of those seven specific areas to lay out why the Reform Party has huge concerns about the whole approach the government is taking with what would be a surplus , if the government does not spend it all before it actually got there .
let us remember the Canadians who were not able to accumulate savings , the Canadians who were not able to take care of themselves .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
Quebec wants to manage its own services , eliminate overlap and duplication , take control of its destiny and become a country by the year 2000 .
third , it is easy to boast about bringing order to our public finances , considering that the finance minister literally robbed workers and employers by improperly dipping into the employment insurance fund .
Mr. Speaker , on behalf of my colleagues in the NDP caucus , I share in the regret that we all feel about this vacancy being created in this way .
it did extraordinarily well .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
in the beginning , it was supposed to cost some $ 260 million .
i welcome the Calgary initiative of the premiers and territorial leaders .
the centre , whose main goal is to improve living conditions for women , provides shelter , counselling , information and support to all women in Laval .
hon. Jean J . Charest :
the CTA appeal does cause us some problem but it is not stopping us from doing the preparatory work , such as the terms of reference , going over lists of individuals who could conduct the review .
we do not hear anything coming from their side on that aspect of it .
( 2 ) The standing committees , which shall consist of the number of Members stipulated below , and for which the lists of members are to be prepared , except as provided in section ( 1 ) of this Standing Order , shall be on :
it reduced the age limit for maturing RPPs , RRSPs and BPSPs .
last February in the House of Commons the Minister of Finance tabled the first draft of Canada pension plan legislation , in case the member for Calgary West was unaware .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the intervention of the House leader .
he has intimated that he does not understand where democracy fits into this bill .
i do not want to see too many of them in the House , but enough of them to participate in the debate .
i do not have all the answers in terms of the process today .
Mr. Joe Jordan :
it is difficult and literally impossible when you do not get the co - operation of the departments to be able to assist the constituents of your own riding , in this case the residents of the Stony reserve .
first of all , I want to make clear that the Reform Party believes strongly in provincial jurisdiction in education .
i would like to take this moment to touch upon the environment .
now , let ask ourselves if it is possible to reconcile justice and escalation .
after communicating with Ron we were shocked to find that so little had been done to protect Canadians in Jordan and elsewhere in the Middle East .
i think it is the wrong way to start off this Parliament .
committees OF THE HOUSE
madam Speaker , I am pleased to rise to speak for a few moments on Bill C - 2 , an act to establish the Canada pension plan investment board and to amend the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts .
will the Calgary declaration and the resulting provincial resolutions convince Quebeckers to turf out their separatist government ?
we have consulted extensively with our membership .
i have had the privilege of representing them for many years now .
speech FROM THE THRONE
so , no employee from the office of the President of the Treasury Board is under investigation .
the federal government recognizes that this restructuring has been difficult for Canadians and , therefore , it will increase health care funding to the provinces from previously budgeted levels .
i know that will involve working very closely and getting the co - operation of the provinces and territories and other stakeholder groups to make that happen .
Mr. Speaker , for some days federalist circles have been on red alert , because Mr. Bouchard ' s economic mission to France has been a success on all counts , which disturbs the federalists across the way .
this is a very serious step in international law and diplomacy designed to send the signal that we will not tolerate the fraudulent use of Canadian passports .
the British government sent certificates of appreciation to these Canadian heroes , but instead of being distributed at the time they were destroyed .
the minister of human resources announced the other day that he has hired an individual to look at the concerns facing the 40,000 fishers on our east coast as the income supplement known as TAGS runs out one year prematurely in May 1998 .
it is clear today that the real reason why Liberal members denounced the Conservative government ' s scandals was that they were not the ones at the receiving end .
i find this strange , since the hon. member has been a member of this House for nine years .
one final point concerns private members ' business .
they both served their constituents and their country well and I think deserve the applause and the commendation of all members of Parliament .
hon. Christine Stewart
over all , participants of all ages supported a publicly funded , reliable , sustainable pension plan which is affordable and which protects against inflation .
if the Bloc members in this House go to the library , they will see my campaign expenses in the report of the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada .
they say that ' s it .
documents are about to be filed .
madam Speaker , I was trying to make the point about how forgotten the people of Cape Breton feel in the nation today and I found myself speaking to an empty government , empty of ideas , empty perhaps of compassion and empty of concern for the people I represent .
there was a time when at least two or three of the leaders in the House would have come from farm backgrounds .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Charlie Penson
will the minister and his cabinet colleagues commit to develop a similar code of conduct to end the exploitation of sweatshop workers and to help the many fair Canadian manufacturers who suffer from this unfair competition ?
we also need to use this and other opportunities that will be presented to us to have if not a full debate , at least a preliminary debate about the future of the education system in so far as religious values are concerned .
he suffered from multiple sclerosis , but this never stopped him from fighting for the poor .
my question is for the Minister of Finance .
again , in this case the information requested was not specific to the individuals but related to the entire band .
the Speaker :
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
the Speaker :
this announcement is certainly a tribute to the community leaders who have pursued a shared vision of Grenville County ' s future in the knowledge economy .
that is a very important point to add when we talk about the supposed inefficiencies of the wheat board .
there they run parallel , separate , distinguishable , and yet are one stream , flowing within the same banks , the mighty St. Lawrence , and rolling on toward the sea bearing the commerce of a nation upon its bosom - a perfect image of our nation .
Mr. Pierre Brien :
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Stan Waters set the example that the Prime Minister can follow , if he chooses to respect the principles of true democracy and honour the will of the people , because Senate election acts currently exist in both British Columbia and Alberta .
i hope government members will raise this matter in caucus , speak to the minister and speak to the critics who deal with the Canada pension plan .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
that is not peanuts .
it is legislation that will place the Canada pension plan on a solid financial footing .
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan
he works for MacMillan Bloedel and he was a very credible candidate .
they are 50 , 40 or 30 hours short of eligibility for unemployment insurance .
i also congratulate the hon. member for St. Paul ' s on her initial speech to the House .
however , now that there is light at the end of the deficit tunnel , we are , as the Speech from the Throne explained , in a position to make strategic investments .
the OECD ' s human development index , as mentioned in the document , indicates that , here in Canada , 50 percent of the children in single parent families live below the poverty line .
* * *
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for CIDA .
but in the National Assembly , and this is what counts , they were unanimously opposed to patriating this Constitution .
such a committee will allow them to make their opinions known while promoting better understanding of the changes sought by the constitutional amendment .
first , I suggest he reread my speech over at leisure .
he told Quebecers to vote no for change .
i find it somewhat ironic that the member opposite often stands in the House to talk about the very excellent public policies of New Zealand .
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY
it must be remembered that this could be the first balanced budget that we have had in some 30 years .
that is the way the question was formed .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay :
a clawback agreement has been entered into by the federal government and certain provincial governments that will keep the poor in essence poorer in this country .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
we do not really know the readmission rate of maternity patients .
there is an important semantic distinction to be made , here .
after all , across this country , there are regions that sometimes feel neglected when they do not get the same investments or attention given other regions .

through national public hearings we met with young people , teachers , parents , social workers and members of the business community .
hon. Don Boudria :
is the member aware and would he acknowledge that for at least 40 years there has been a succession of governments in Quebec , each more legitimate than the last , which has given rise to the process of constitutional review .
we all know people who have been infected with HIV through blood transfusions and who have since passed away .
we do have people who were appointed as the CEO of that corporation .
women want social programs more than they want tax cuts .
as the labour critic for the Reform Party , I noticed that the throne speech was sadly lacking in the area of labour .
if the odd time we have a problem like we have across there right now , the police will solve the problem sooner or later .
we in the House have to start thinking about the average Canadian and not relating to our pension plan which is what we are doing overall .
i urge members to make sure that this Chamber does not become a rubber stamp for the provinces .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅
the Liberal member would do well to look at her own situation .
i would like to thank my parents for their unconditional love and support .
the report coming out this week is sure to be very critical of the government ' s handling of not only the TAGS program but the management , or should I say mismanagement , of the groundstock species .
we had the idea that it was going back to the provinces and so forth , but nobody ever saw a financial statement actually showing clearly where the float of the Canada pension plan money was at any one time .
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Human Resources Development informed us that he forwarded lists of grant applicants to the ministers responsible for the regions , including the President of Treasury Board .
what is it he is trying to hide ?
competition ACT
there is a balance that can be obtained by referring all regulations to the appropriate committees .
Mr. Bill Matthews
Mr. Speaker , it is reported that the environmental protection branch , a key department that helps regulate polluting industries , is targeted for cuts consistent with the ongoing direction of federal - provincial harmonization .
i think it is time to wrap it up .
we hope it will use the opportunity of the first ministers conference to propose a covenant in health care , to recognize that the agenda on health care in this country will not be a national agenda until the national government plays its role .
the other point I want to make is that we also have a duty in representing our constituents to offer constructive criticism to government bills .
Mr. Denis Coderre
Mr. Egoyan , who is a guest of the Minister of Canadian Heritage , is here with his wife , Arsin 茅 e Khanjian , who also appears in her husband ' s most recent and critically lauded film The Sweet Hereafter , and their son Arshile .
the Speaker
i also want to thank his staff , Michael Spowart and Esther Shron for staying with me and providing the seamless transition for the people of St. Paul ' s with their ongoing care and experience .
this government has identified children as a major priority in its public policy initiatives .
it really could be choice
the CWB status as an agent of the crown and crown corporation would end when the new board of directors assumes office .
i have always wondered why the New Democratic Party has never managed to see eye to eye with us on these social values , and , at the same time , why it has not been possible to get the social democrats to recognize the Quebec people .
the riding of Erie - Lincoln truly runs from lake to lake to river .
does the Prime Minister think that he has boosted the Supreme Court ' s credibility by appointing to it the former co - chairman of the national yes committee in the 1992 referendum on the Charlottetown accord ?
Mr. Speaker , I am glad to be able to respond to this question .
we are once again a nation and all of us as Canadians , whether we live in Ontario , Quebec , British Columbia , Manitoba or wherever , can realistically see the light at the end of the tunnel .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) :
i say sham because the government will retain fairly significant control over the Canadian Wheat Board .
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) :
presently a person needs to make Canada pension contributions in two of the three years previous or five of the last ten years in order to be eligible to apply and qualify for disability benefits .
we take this opportunity to wish them peace , happiness and health in the new year .
it would be sort of a Robin Hood in reverse where the poor are giving to the rich so that the rich can retire in comfort in condos in Florida and elsewhere around the world .
would he not agree that the impact of so - called downloading has not been as severe as he might suggest simply because the government feels it is important to have given that tax break notwithstanding any changes from federal transfers ?
Mr. Speaker , obviously the member was not in the House when I spoke earlier or he would have heard me address this issue .
the Conservatives and the Liberals are guilty of influence peddling , tollgating and doing all sorts of illegal things with respect to people ' s money .
our hope is that he will work with the opposition parties to help farmers and rural Canadians across the country .
in November 1996 the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies published a book about the effects that the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency has had on the Atlantic region .
we assure them that other members of Parliament are more than willing to help represent them until a successor for Sharon is chosen .
let us look at their alternative for a moment .
we have to be a little cautious .
we will challenge parents , communities , schools and provincial governments to encourage young people to stay in school .
if the wheat board does not look clearly into what our young farmers are saying , and I know this is true in Souris - Moose Mountain , if they are not given an option , then the wheat board , in its original purpose , the reason for which it was designed , will self - destruct .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
let me begin by saying that it is a pleasure to be back in the House on behalf of the people of Cambridge , Kitchener , Ayr and North Dumfries .
they should know , as they plan for their future , that there will be only three people working for every person retiring .
it has hacked more than one - third out of health transfers to the provinces and territories .
i conclude by saying that I do not feel any pride when I see the representative of the area I too represent making such a clown of himself in the House of Commons .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy
it is like the Lourdes or Fatima secret .
even though the Prime Minister had promised during the 1991 election campaign to shorten the qualifying period , today we find ourselves with a system that no longer meets the needs of the unemployed .
i am talking specifically about games of dice .
we are investing a lot more money in transitional job funds in Newfoundland than anything that was done before .
it would be a tremendous benefit which would be turned over entirely to the surviving spouse .
as far as the health protection branch is concerned , this is the minister who put a freeze on those cuts , this is the minister who is going to appoint a science advisory board to give us independent advice on what scientists we need .
the ability of the department has been called into question as to whether the Department of Fisheries and Oceans can effectively manage the fisheries resource .
Mr. John Reynolds
i am therefore rather proud of the initiatives taken by this government to ensure the survival of our pension program .
i do not think anyone , especially the Bloc Quebecois , is in a position to point the finger on the subject of taking the appropriate action in such a case .
this is a serious matter .
even the Prime Minister said he was going to get them out of their house and prevent them from going to the pub .
Mr. Monte Solberg
we must also ensure that they can make the transition to the workplace .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
when is the minister going to change the name from 24 Sussex Drive to 24 Sucks us Dry ?
Mrs. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold
Mr. Steve Mahoney
make no mistake , good jobs are here and more are coming .
this debt should not and must not be put on the backs solely of the young and the unborn .
Mr. Speaker , the Reform member is mentioning pensions .
hon. Paul Martin
Mr. Greg Thompson
petitions
if there were misunderstandings in the history of the relations between Quebec and Canada , they were on the federal side .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise in the House today to echo the tribute to the Canadian men and women who were called by the British government to assist the Allies ' air defence and they answered " Ready , aye , ready '' .
the people of the community of Fredericton know what a contribution Chester MacRae made in war , in peace , as an educator .
yea .
it is unfortunate that there are not more members in the House today .
Mr. Speaker , I have a very Liberal question for the Minister of Transport .
we have set what those priorities are and we will continue to adhere to our plan .
* * *
until we know these results , the opposition should be very careful about whose reputation it attacks .
there will be some real tension if we do not realize there has been a paradigm shift .
it will also continue to address the serious international problem of over - fishing .
engaging Canadians in their governance , including them , has allowed us to make the right decisions and has now brought us to a point where for the first time in 30 years our government can begin to think about the choices that we want to make to build a stronger Canada for the 21 st century .
last February , you may recall , the Bloc Quebecois made public a document analyzing the government ' s budgetary situation , as well as the deficit .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
* * *
it does not matter what the people of Edmonton - Strathcona think in the sense of their recognizing any specific group as a people .
we spent a wonderful afternoon discussing the difference between being a member of Parliament in 1993 and being a member of Parliament in the late fifties and early sixties .
i know of a plan that is actuarially sound .
taxpayers do not need more grand schemes .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
being a neighbour of his constituency , a lot of the emissions that are being released in Swan Hills from the many industries from which his province profits end up in northern Saskatchewan .
i am not trying to imply that this lack of consensus means that the government should not act .
it will then be a task of the finance committee , of which the member for Medicine Hat was a very distinguished member and will be again I trust .
what does the opposition do ?
unfortunately , the government is not really working for the people .
why should we be spending pension dollars unnecessarily on the administration of a pension plan ?
it is one of the most important achievements in our history and a cornerstone of Canadian society .
Canadians are feeling renewed confidence .
that is what is in our paper .
the formula for adjusting previous earnings in calculating retirement benefits will be based on the average of the year ' s maximum pensionable earnings over the last five years instead of the three currently , prior to starting the pension .
if it is the intention of the Liberal government to pursue its national unity strategy by promoting the concept of Quebec ' s unique character while ignoring the equality of Canadians and provinces and the commitment to involve the public in the process , its strategy will not work , nor will the official opposition support such a strategy .
i am sure he is aware that any changes in the plan , as contained in the legislation or changes which will be made due to subsequent consideration , require the approval of the provinces .
in the throne speech we heard that the federal government , as its financial position improves , intends to intervene increasingly in areas of provincial jurisdiction , including health and education .
Mr. Inky Mark
it is not easy to raise money at $ 5 , $ 10 , or $ 20 a head but this reminds us of a hard reality .
we want development the involves local people .
Mamdam Speaker , if I pleased the minister with my speech at least , that makes me happy .
as we all know , the CPP is essentially a pay as you go system where the contributions of today pay the pensions earned in the past .
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Lorne Nystrom :
if the past were any indication of the future , it would be a cause for concern .
i believe that we as a caring society and a caring nation need to put in place a program to eradicate child hunger .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
no , Mother Teresa ' s example was to pick the maggots out of people ' s open wounds herself .
what is going on ?
they were not satisfied with the marketing of grain .
i repeat , Canadians , our current retirees , have to be assured that their benefits will not be affected by what we are doing in this place .
i will congratulate them on their re - examination and their concern for Canadians instead of just following the rhetoric of a few .
i would also like to take this opportunity , as I did in my maiden speech in January 1994 to thank my family , Sherrie , Megan , Patrick , Alanna , Andrew and Sarah , my parents and my siblings for their ongoing support and understanding .
it belongs to the people of our riding , in my case the citizens of Nepean - Carleton .
Mr. Dale Johnston
a growing dynamic community , I have been proud to make Whitby my home for the past 25 years .
i want to assure you of my full co - operation .
my belief is if distinct society is the same as unique character , then why are we changing the wording ?
they now consume about $ 47 billion a year .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
of course they were wrong .
working with its partners , the Government of Canada will continue to reduce barriers to post - secondary education by reforming the Canada student loans program , by making it easier for students to repay their student loans , by introducing new grants for post - secondary students with dependants and by introducing scholarships to promote academic excellence for low to moderate incomes .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur
Ms. Angela Vautour
* * *
the Caisse has been very effective with this kind of investment , but its purpose has always been to strike a balance between security and maximizing the rate of return .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to put a question to the government .
with private sector involvement , education and training programs would be better directed and would thus better equip young Canadians with the skill sets that employers need .
that is how good it was back then .
there would be a second American revolution .
some hon. members :
like most members who have spoken here today , I am both privileged to represent my constituents and humbled by the trust they have placed in me .
( the sitting of the House was suspended at 12.10 p.m. )
she was married in a traditional Muslim ceremony and her husband thereafter immediately left for Canada .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau
Aha .
i take this opportunity to publicly congratulate the hon. member for Niagara Centre on his re - election as Speaker of the House .
suspension of sitting
the Speaker :
it is wrong .
so every decision had to be approved by the federal government , it had to be unanimous and it had to be in writing .
the Reform Party would rather have private plans .
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) :
in what is described as the single largest religious gathering in American history , the promise keepers rally proves that the institution of the family is not a thing of the past but a stronghold for the future .
my question is to the Prime Minister .
Mr. John Finlay ( Oxford , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 245 , an act to amend the Criminal Code ( penalties for sexual offences involving children ) .
there are aging people who want to be looked after in their homes .
this process of consultation could not be one of which I am more proud because it is open .
NEWFOUNDLAND
never .
( the sitting of the House was suspended at 2.58 p.m. )
some hon. members :
our strength as a nation will be immeasurably enhanced if we continue to foster actively an environment that is conducive to achieving even greater unity as a nation .
i do not want to bore the House but let me quote one more Department of Finance economist .
members
we know the government has promised in the past to be more accountable .
if he continues to ignore the concerns of western Canada , if he refuses to recognize Canada as a federation of equal provinces and citizens , if he continues to ignore the pleadings for parliamentary and Senate reform , he will have sown the wind only to reap the whirlwind .
it is the debate that is currently taking place in Alberta which has two surplus budgets .
all measures will be considered by this House in the same manner , whether they are initiated here and debated in the other place subsequently , or initiated in the other place and debated here subsequently .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i have a few notes here .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
the people said pay down the debt .
it has put Canadians in two camps , those living in large urban centres and those living in rural settings .
for the past 130 years , Canada ' s achievements have earned this country the admiration of the whole world .

Mr. Bob Mills
Mr. Speaker , the Government of Canada is on a mission to eliminate the Canada port police .
Mr. Speaker , I think we have to be very careful here , because I myself am not aware that someone in my office may be under investigation .
Mr. Speaker , I remind all hon. members that October 5 to 11 is fire prevention week .
IRAP helps members of Parliament in their ridings to help their businesses which then create jobs .
i am not sure whether that is true of the 36 th , but I believe it is .
Mr. Rahim Jaffer
we have endured it for over 20 years .
he was very active in the educational movement , in the trade union movement and in the formation of the CCF both provincially and federally .
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure today to present a petition on behalf of 57 constituents who live in a co - op housing project on 610 Beatrice Street in my riding .
Mr. Jay Hill
francophones
Mr. Speaker , my question is directed to the Prime Minister .
what does the government think of this ?
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Kitchener - Waterloo , Lib . ) :
i ask the hon. member to stand in his place forthwith and to withdraw the word " treasonous '' , I believe it was .
we had to make a legislative change because the pension plan for parliamentarians is mandatory .
the Progressive Conservatives have 90 per cent of their seats east of Ontario , with a majority in Atlantic Canada .
this is not an easy issue , but I believe it draws our attention to the very important role of the Constitution in regard to the protection of minority rights .
if it were it would result in a voluntary pool for grain covered by the marketing plan .
this is the sad price people must pay when hoping to gain more insight into the government they are dealing with today and , unfortunately , for a few years to come .
CALGARY DECLARATION
the question is on the motion .
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) :
on behalf of all members , I applaud our teachers for the valuable work they do .
the member has set forth his priorities without consultation as he seems to say we have done .
i call upon all the members of the House to lend their support to the amendments contained in the legislation .
they dislike seeing funds poorly invested or hard earned dollars frittered away on foolish , made in Ottawa schemes .
a message was delivered by the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod as follows :
the House has heard the terms of the motion .
figures that we have obtained from Human Resources Development Canada suggest a trend starting in 1995 to reject most of the applications for CPP disability .
they ensure that families have the resources to care for their children .
our weapons are our words , our ideas , our beliefs .
the foreign property limit for pension funds will strictly apply to the Canada pension plan , but there are some transitional issues that need to be addressed .
i think Canadians deserve to get a little back for all their hard work in helping us to get the deficit under control .
let us look where politicians are : right on the bottom just above lawyers .
we must promote those knowledge intensive sectors where we are already strong , where the opportunity for growth and global leadership is highest , and where the opportunities for young Canadians are the greatest .
i have heard the Reform Party indicate from time to time that everybody should have a flat tax and everybody should pay the same .
for the final age category , that being our elderly , what more can a government do but to make sure that the pension systems are secure and that seniors do not have to worry about the future .
the second historic misunderstanding was to have believed that , in 1982 when Pierre Elliott Trudeau patriated the Canadian Constitution without Quebec ' s agreement , we would get down on our knees and agree to this Constitution that we never wanted .
this consensus is grounded on three basic principles : first , the existence of the people of Quebec ; next , respect for fundamental democratic principles ; finally , the integrity of Quebec territory .
i would also urge the government to continue on the track it is on , and I would ask all members to support the motion of the hon. member from Parkdale with respect to the throne speech .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to inform the minister and give him the number .
the government must continue to seek out the opportunities that will put Canadians back to work and which will put many young Canadians to work for the first time in productive and fulfilling jobs .
i thank the member for his questions .
does she think it is a reasonable request for when New Democrats throw a specific idea on the floor ?
Mr. Speaker , how do they spell relief over there ?
those same principles are still the object of strong Canadian consensus today .
i have risen many times in the House to uphold the rights of seniors , one of society ' s most vulnerable groups .
as I said earlier I have spent a great deal of my political career listening to Canadians across the country .
* * *
second language classes are compulsory from the fourth grade to the end of college .
this along with tourism are areas that create employment in the north and must be explored as valid industries .
if we are to have an effective volunteer reserve force and if Canada is to meet its international commitments we must take steps to ensure that reservists are able to get the training they need and the time required to get that training .
how is it that this government can be so unfeeling and so callous toward the victims , the family members of the victims and the family members of the murderer himself ?
Mr. Speaker , the first and fundamental challenge we face with our health care system , and I know the hon. member is aware of this , is restoring the confidence of Canadians in the basic medicare which we have come to know and depend on .
we have to mobilize on a Canada - wide basis , drawing on all the stakeholders , the private sector , governments and community groups .
appointment OF A SPECIAL JOINT COMMITTEE
Mr. Speaker , one of the disturbing things about the government ' s approach to national unity is that it always seems to be lagging rather than leading public opinion .
i ask members to be very judicious in their choice of words .
will he table it in the House today ?
other consultations I have engaged in in the short time I have been solicitor general include meetings with IACOLE , the Canadian criminal justice system , the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police , the aboriginal police chiefs and the national reference group which we established with some 40 organizations .
this rapid increase in the contribution rate is a concern for several reasons .
Mr. David Iftody ( Provencher , Lib . ) :
for the past 20 years it has been illegal in Canada to pay men and women different wages if they are performing work of equal value .
hear , hear .
as to how long we will be doing that , I say quite honestly that will be really up to the Ministry of Transport to make that determination .
it was very educational for the Federal Fisherman .
* * *
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
do they not understand that the solutions of the 1970 s are not going to fix the problems of the 1990 s ?
we have asked VIA to come back and let us know what other actions it is going to take to comply with the board ' s request .
hon. Lawrence MacAulay
Mr. Speaker , I hope the hon. member will start to use the truth once in a while .
my department arranged a briefing in good faith , provided the briefing and attempted to accommodate the request for information within the law .
first , there are those who would abolish the wheat board .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
one of those ways would be to have the board take an at port position .
that is how contracts are allocated .
it will tie the hands of future Parliaments .
we leave that open for Canadians to tell us to do that .
some hon. members :
while it is a movement that began in the west with the Reform Party it is fueled by frustration shared by people all across this country .
by caring for our elders we can teach our youth to be compassionate and caring .
the lack of secure employment manifests itself in any number of social symptoms .
we cannot create smart parents .
finally , there is the long overdue $ 2 billion in compensation paid to the Maritimes but not to Quebec for harmonizing the GST , one of the demands from Quebec that was also supported by all premiers at the St. Andrews meeting .
first , I must congratulate her for a very passionate and good speech , in which she defends culture .
the 73 percent increase over the next six years is simply another example of an oppressive tax by the Liberals .
[ editor ' s Note :
* * *
it is then my sincere hope the proposed amendments exempting Canadians travelling to the U.S. each year are passed as soon as possible .
my question is for the Prime Minister .
the Speaker :
are we on the right track with this computer system we are having trouble setting up ?
it is a very united riding , a riding that takes strength from its diversity and its sense of community , a riding which is exemplary of what can be accomplished through community based activities and initiatives , a riding that shows that diversity does not equate to disunity .
this legislation also ensures the continuation of full indexation .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I do not have that information .
the presentations which I heard this afternoon , as a new member in this House , seem to imply that we have arrived , we are there , as a Canadian people and it is now time to move on to new government programs .
because they do not have a choice .
here is the voice of business saying " We do not want grants for business '' , but what does the government do ?
nor was it clear how many of the directors would be appointed by the minister and how many would be elected by the farmers .
i look forward to meeting with the hon. member to discuss how we can assist her in creating the Nunavut territory and making it a better place for her people to live .
it seems to me that it is just a simple matter of a member of the Ontario government picking up a pen and writing a little note and whisking it off to the Attorney General of Canada .
the hon. member for Elk Island will not be around that long to look after it , but some of the younger members under the age of 30 , still in diapers , will be able to look after it .
it is an institution in which Canadians take great pride .
i wonder if , conversely , our friends from the Bloc Quebecois recognize that there is French Canadian people and a Canadian people .
there are $ 26 billion in increased taxes .
there will be plenty of opportunity for debate .
that is representative democracy .
i look forward to working with him as we work together with First Nations to find that framework .
this is the first time that the Senate will consider government public bills prior to the House at a time when the party representation in the Senate is so out of sync with the wishes of the electorate .
* * *
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
nobody is fooled by what is going on .
regarding higher taxes , there is no question , and the Minister of Finance has said it before , that this government will deal with the burden of taxes for low and middle income Canadians .
the list of estimates referred to in this motion being long , I would ask that the House give its consent to have it printed in Hansard without being read .
the changes are the result of the latest statutory review of the CPP that the federal and provincial governments , as joint stewards of the plan , began in 1995 .
when I asked the question why must there be an inclusion clause to include canola , flax , rye and oats , the answer I received was if there is going to be an exclusion clause , then we should have an inclusion clause .
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) :
taken together , these systems provide a good balance of government and individual responsibility for retirement income security .
the Speaker :
the CPP is not intended to be the only source of income for seniors , although by necessity it is for many .
research and development , the development of new technologies and the building of research infrastructure which will be a part of the product of this new foundation is of great interest to me .
it is not difficult to see why they would favour cuts in personal income taxes when we look at an article that was printed in the Vancouver Sun on September 18 and sent to me by a constituent .
i am asking the Prime Minister to tell us why his ministers comply with the government ' s code of conduct , but not him , since he left a person strongly suspected of influence peddling mingle with Liberal Party members and ministers .
they deserve a greater return on their investment .
Mr. Michel Guimond
Mr. Speaker , it does the member good to be in the official opposition .
they also understood the significant demographic changes in Canadian society which are creating the need to ensure the sustainability of the Canada pension plan for the long term .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
it is spreading some mistruths in this country , that social programs are a big problem in terms of deficit and debt and unemployment .
Mr. Speaker , the Montreal daily The Gazette reported yesterday that the Conservative leader had decided that his colleagues would exercise a free vote on the amendment to section 93 of the Constitution Act requested by the Quebec government , since a moral issue is involved .
Mr. Bill Matthews
right now , the social and environmental side of things is often neglected in international trade agreements .
although governments are now training to staff the public service there have to be mechanisms in place to keep our youth in school and to pursue post - secondary education .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabasca , PC ) :
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
however , I disagree totally with its means to this end .
the principal interest of the federal Parliament in educational reform is mainly that such reforms do not prejudicially affect the rights of minorities which Parliament has an obligation to protect .
i am surprised he did not talk about that .
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
as time goes on , without indexing the basic exemption , more and more of the burden will fall on low income people as the funding of CPP becomes less and less progressive .
Mr. Dick Harris
i ask , Mr. Speaker , that all questions be allowed to stand .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
third , does this amendment enjoy a reasonable degree of support from the citizens affected by it ?
all great leaders have had an uncanny ability to take with them not only members of their own party , not only selected individuals , but with a unique combination of courage , determination , introspection and imagination an entire country .
the amendment to section 497 provides for such a person to be held , to give the board that granted the parole or release if the board considers it advisable an opportunity to apply to keep the person in custody until it is able to issue a warrant of apprehension to facilitate a review of the parole or release under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act .
Canadians told us they wanted their plan fixed now , not scrapped , not privatized .
the poet indicated of the two options that life always offers .
hon. Allan Rock
Mr. Speaker , I am informed that the drug in question , Imitrex , has been available in Canada since January 1992 .
there is a reference in the throne speech to the deficit war being won .
the CPP has other benefits that RRSPs do not have .
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) :
it was made by a famous Canadian and certainly a famous Nova Scotian .
what did he personally do to protect his government ' s integrity and that of his ministers once he was made aware of the fact that a fundraiser for the Liberal Party of Canada was peddling influence to businesses that had applied for grants ?
will the minister immediately provide that flexibility to the system so that British Columbia salmon harvesters can achieve financial viability and at the same time protect stock sustainability ?
Mr. Speaker , I would urge you not to be persuaded by the rather feeble argument offered by the government House leader that whatever happened in the last Parliament is somehow immune to your judgment or to the judgment of members of its appropriateness .
when the government members held consultations did they want to hear about this sort of plan ?
consumer PACKAGING AND LABELLING ACT
thank God we had trade agreements .
on behalf of the Conservative Party , I add my voice of condolence to the family , to this House and to all Canadians , for Mr. Fraser will be sorely missed .
a few years ago we had a deficit of $ 42 billion and very soon we will have reduced it to zero .
Mr. Reg Alcock ( Winnipeg South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Randy White
we therefore went ahead with it .
hon. Herb Gray
Mr. Philip Mayfield ( Cariboo - Chilcotin , Ref. ) :
what are the options ?
i offer my condolences to the members of his family , to all his friends and , I would add , to the employees of the House and the table officers , all of whom shared this moment of sadness .
if five have done so , according to the figures I recall , there may well be 800 to 1,200 industries , businessmen , who have had their arms twisted to contribute very large amounts of money .
it is certainly not the most appealing image and that is why I want listeners to know right off the bat that I intend to be very critical but realistic in my remarks .
paired
madam Speaker , I am pleased to speak on Bill C - 4 , the amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act .
Mr. Speaker , I want to take the opportunity first of all in participating in this debate to express my sincere gratitude to the prime minister for the confidence he has placed in me by appointing me as the Solicitor General of Canada .
i admit there are times when it is justified , but this approach can easily be abused .
that is one factor taken into consideration when we talk about how we spend government money in Canada .
we must make sure contributions match the payouts over any period of time .

what will the minister do to assure British Columbians that he will be as sympathetic to their concerns as he is to Quebecers ?
does the Prime Minister , who claims to be so concerned about clarity and transparency , consider this method of consultation to be sufficient and satisfactory ?
the throne speech is filled with page after page of new spending programs .

bill C - 242 .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅
the message was that the CPP is a very vital part of Canadian society , a very foundation under which we operate and one that needs to be maintained .
let me take the points in reverse .
how does he define his representation of constituents ?
two things .
we have the right to speak unafraid and we have the right to vote .
the murder was so bad that the presiding judge said there would be no opportunity for parole for a minimum of 25 years .
it is interesting to sit between these two arguments and try to find out what makes any sense .

returning to the matter at hand , I would like to focus my remarks on a few key issues raised in the throne speech , namely youth unemployment , the importance of exports to the Canadian economy and the need for a forward thinking approach to national unity .
what does the federal government have to gain from getting involved in areas under provincial jurisdiction ?

the sentence imposed on a person for such an offence shall be served consecutively to any other punishment that is imposed on the person .

under this new legislation Canada pension plan funds will now be invested in a diversified portfolio of securities prudently and at arm ' s length from government .
he went throughout western Canada organizing truckloads of furniture and supplies which were sent from western Canadians into the Saguenay .

congratulations to you , Sir , on behalf of all of us .

oh , oh .
we must share both benefits and burdens , strife and success fairly and equitably for the good of all .
and the list goes on .
i listened with great care to the speech of the member for Calgary Southwest because I am a great believer that , in this Parliament , when the opposition speaks it must speak constructively .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
this enactment makes a breach of a condition of parole or statutory or temporary release an indictable or summary conviction offence as is the case for breach of a probation order .
students from all regions of the country were able to visit Quebec , while Quebec students were able to increase their awareness of Canada outside Quebec .
yes , and none other than him and his government .
this is the power the federal government is now using against the provinces , selling its bill of goods about a strong government in Ottawa and a subservient one in the provinces .
fourth , the government claims to be looking at international experience with respect to moving toward more funded pension plans .
madam Speaker , I am dividing my time today with the hon. member for Vancouver East .
while our colleges have a major role to play , clearly our universities do as well .
Mr. Michel Gauthier
i know that on the first round there were focus groups .
bill C - 246 .
however , right now it is a total disaster .
however , there was silence from the government on these critical issues .
hon. Sheila Copps
what incredible dividends it has paid to Canadians , to our economy and even to our sense of identity .
some say these payroll taxes are job killers and why are we planning on increasing the CPP contributions by almost 70 % over the next six years .
remember Canada has a great reputation when it comes to our wheat and we want to maintain that .
unable to meet the Minister of Human Resources Development , I took the initiative of stopping him in the Liberal ' s backroom .
we should also note the basic exemption under which no premiums will be collected on the first $ 3,500 in earnings .
Mr. Speaker , I understand that the hon. member is trying to score political points , but if she looked at the facts , she would see that even the auditor general stated clearly in his reports that my department and this government are making tremendous progress .
second reading
this is a fact as presented in the government ' s own figures .
some hon. members :
those types of things will have to be addressed .
the public wanted employment insurance reform but they wanted humane reform , the kind of reform that is a reflection of economic reality and gives regional economies a chance to diversify .
the throne speech makes reference to the government ' s intention to promote trade in Canadian culture and support Canadian culture at home .
the most basic precaution for a government leader is to ensure that , during an election campaign , he and his ministers do not come into contact with someone under investigation .
the grant awarded the Auberge des Gouverneurs in the riding of Saint - Maurice comes not from the transitional job creation fund , the subject of my letter to the RCMP , but rather targeted salary grants .
my company , which was primarily myself , made a profit of about $ 6,500 per house .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
we spoke of a youth policy with a clear objective where every young person should either be in school , in training , at work or doing community service .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) :
many of the flaws were due to a lack of accountability .
i am sure members know how hard , in Canada ' s multiparty system , it is to get a majority win .
last year 12 of Canada ' s top thinkers on science and technology were appointed to the Prime Minister ' s Advisory Council on Science and Technology .
why will he not stand today and instead of attack the government , congratulate the government on finally cleaning up the mess of nine years of inaction by the Conservative government ?
the way we have worked together in the past has not provided us with the benefits one might expect .
we have aboriginal people living on reserves .
at the same time we recognize the proposed changes should not impact unduly on anyone or any group in society .
in the House she was a fierce defender of the interests of the national capital region , a fervent advocate of human rights , a committed spokesperson for women ' s health and an active proponent for the municipal infrastructure program .
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
the co - operative ' s 225 shareholders have set up a grain centre , which means they can process and package their own crops .
when we first raised this issue in the House just several days ago , the prime minister assured us that no Canadian agents were involved in this anti - terrorist mission or the illegal use of Canadian passports .
some hon. members :
most of these ridings , particularly in Atlantic Canada , are not Liberal ridings any more and the program is still there .
this is one example of how true it is that Canadians forget that their country goes much further beyond 60 掳 north .
Mr. Speaker , I will be pleased to bring the hon. member ' s question to the attention of my colleague , the Minister of Human Resources Development .
the priority of all Quebecers is to get the economy moving once again .
Mr. Jason Kenney
i do not think we will find Canadians anywhere who will disagree with investing in youth , investing in innovation and ensuring we are equipped to move into the next millennium , ensuring this country is equipped and able to compete with companies and other countries around the world .
that is going to require some fundamental shifts in thinking and a healthy dose of collective effort .
i think of the families of the victims of Clifford Olson and what they have endured as a result of the faint hope clause .
introduction and first reading
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
all benefits , now and in the future , will remain fully indexed to inflation .
in this 36 th Parliament of Canada I call on the government to stop advocating policies and legislation which are damaging to the resource industries and instead effect change that will promote the growth of the industries .
Mr. Speaker , once again , no charges have been laid in this investigation .
the prospect of that tremendous turnaround raised an obvious issue .
a new balance of responsibilities will be established in the federation .
Mr. Speaker , I think the hon. member will agree with me that the throne speech is an empty shell , that it contains nothing to reassure Quebecers , that it has brought little hope to our young people and no hope to our seniors .
we see it every day of our lives whether it is at the supermarket , or when we do computerized banking or whether it is robotics in the manufacturing sector .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
shame on those Tories across the way for using closure '' .
we want to make sure that we get the kind of helicopter that will best meet the operational needs of the people who go out and save lives .
i would like to know if an official from his department has actually seen these passports to determine whether or not they are forged .
someone once said that Mr. Fraser saw this place as a sort of university .
the federal and provincial ministers agreed on a three part approach to restore the financial sustainability of the CPP and make it fair and affordable for future generations .
it is the insensitivity of the government that has allowed this kind of thing to happen in Canadian society .
compassion is not partisan in principle .
it is an honour and a great privilege to bring this part of Ontario back to the Liberal fold after some 52 years .
this is economics 101 .
there are plenty of good ways to do it .
Mr. Speaker , that is the minister who this summer eliminated the drug research lab and gutted the food research lab .
the member spoke about cuts in government .
sadly these stories have helped to perpetuate myths like the one that having a good education does not matter .
the Right Hon. John G . Diefenbaker once said to parliament " Parliament is more than a procedure .
similarly in my profession the medical protective association is being accused of having too big a surplus in its fund .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
* * *
i thank him for his counsel , past and present , as I try to grow into those boots .
it being almost 2 p.m. , we will proceed to Statements by Members .
this brings me to a point mentioned earlier , but which certainly deserves to be re - examined .
it is certainly not what the Liberals did , because they did not do anything concrete , absolutely nothing at all .
in the last election the government promised national pharmacare based on its own forum recommendations for a universal single payer drug plan .
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague .
they did this by moving to fuller funding by accelerating contribution rate increases now so they will not have to exceed 10 % for future generations .
Canadians may not know that the domestic market is $ 95 billion and exports over $ 20 billion , but the people of Perth - Middlesex do .
the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Speaker , asbestos exports are a government priority .
that request was granted .
as solicitor general I am responsible for providing national leadership on issues relating to federal corrections , policing and national security .
so , as far as I am concerned , the answer is clear .
we are doing our best and the matter is being taken very seriously .
will the hon. member recognize that there is nothing in the throne speech to address the urgent needs of Cape Bretonners and Newfoundlanders and people in Atlantic Canada who have persistently suffered under this economic policy ?
there is no question that these species need to be protected but private landowners must be compensated for their loss .
Mr. Speaker , earlier this month the world lost the moral beacon of the 20 th century .
we can do it fairly over the people who are going to be contributing in those years , until that boom hits us .
madam Speaker , I propose that all the questions be allowed to stand .
however , now there is a Reformer talking about fairness in tax load .
Mr. Speaker , Quebeckers have already voted democratically on two occasions and decided to remain in Canada .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. Leader of the Opposition will know that the Canadian passports require less visas than perhaps any other passport in the world .
we will find out in due course what the privacy commissioner thinks .
Mr. Speaker , if they want to have a debate they should withdraw their tactics not to have a debate .
Mr. Dennis J . Mills
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te
considerable time has gone by since the last changes to the employment insurance were introduced .
he is setting a target to shoot at .
we will increase the participation of Canadians in the new economy .
* * *
i say only partially because , when I read the terms of reference of the board in the bill and compare it with those of Quebec , I can see that the difference is fairly significant .
is the creation of the Ontario Wheat Board not a Canadian bill ?
there are some small countries that have experimented with the proposal that Reform discusses .
i will be in Montreal shortly to meet these people .
the notion that a referendum might be held cannot apply here for the two following reasons : first , as the hon. member will understand , what this is all about , from A to Z , on the X as well as on the Y axis , in any way one tries to look at it , involves only the education sector .
i am very tempted to remind him that the last time he rolled up his sleeves and got down to work , it was to make cuts in transfers to the provinces , but that is not the point I want to discuss with him today .
sitting Resumed
could she tell me what they are saying to her in regard to crime and the justice system ?
i would even admit that there are some countries where high level government presence is critical .
there is also a benefit to the surviving children of $ 2,000 a year up to age 18 and up to age 25 if they are students .
Mr. Speaker , I think the Prime Minister has his priorities wrong .
senator PAT CARNEY
another study conducted by three economists showed that the CWB ' s single desk system generates an additional $ 265 million per year in wheat revenue for farmers , thereby enhancing Canada ' s competitiveness .
after being kicked in the stomach a few times like this , the smart players say " No more , thanks '' .
i really have to commend it for recognizing that many seniors are living well under the poverty line and that we should be taking some notice of how to deal with that .
changes will be made to payments of death benefits .
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen :
so one never knows where Frank McKenna may land when it comes to his future decisions .
this is the way Canadians across the country would want the government to act and I urge them to consider that .
the good work of the former mayor of Saint John to bring the municipal police force to the level it is will lend itself to a wonderful port authority and police authority in that city .
after serving briefly on the staff of the Hon. Brooke Claxton in Ottawa , he attended the University of British Columbia law school , practising law in Prince Rupert before returning to Ottawa as executive assistant to the Hon. James Sinclair .
the Speaker :
i guess that does not matter either .
it would assist the private sector to meet its labour requirements and ensure that young people would have the opportunity to acquire that important first job .
i can assure the House that we will take every measure possible .
we can make a difference in the lives of all our children .
all the cuts came with an extremely high price .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
it is a pleasure to stand in the House today and to speak to the motion put forward by my colleague from Medicine Hat , that this House condemn the government for making its 50:50 election promise on future surpluses without adequate public debate as to the optimal size of government , taxes and debt , thus threatening to repeat Canada ' s 27 year old history of deficit spending , creating high debt , financed by high taxes , causing high unemployment .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
miss Deborah Grey
he sounds so much like a Reformer that I had to look twice to see who was doing the talking .
i did say it would not be easy to do that .
he discussed at length the greenhouse gas issue , but that is not the only issue .
they will see a decrease and this decrease is due to the fact that we want to address the problem of income disparity by ensuring that low income Canadians are not adversely impacted by the proposed changes .
MANITOBA FLOOD
aboriginal communities across the country are desperate for economic development and jobs while this government stalls on the royal commission recommendations .
for example , I do not believe Bob Rae or Roy Romanow really wanted to close 100 hospitals over 18 months .
the support for separation and leaving Canada is not a popular concept any more in Quebec .
how is this different from the way the Tories did it ?
what the Government of Canada has done today is truly shameful .
joined together for the common good , we can discover what we can give to build this country rather than just calculate what we can get from the government which are really just other taxpayers .
with the aboriginal community , the French community and the English community , Canada will be much stronger .
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia ) :
let us be bold enough and forward - looking enough to uphold their vision by continuing the investment in our children ' s future and our nation ' s future .
estimates suggest this fund will be over $ 200 billion in just 15 years .
the Speaker :
i would suggest that we need to assemble stories and pictures from across our land so that we will be able to communicate to each other what is historically and personally important to us so that we can make our communities even stronger .
we have a 73 percent increase in the premiums but no change in the benefits .
this is my first intervention in the 36 th Parliament and I would like to thank the people of Durham who graciously have decided to send me back to the House .
all we have heard from the Reform Party is its interest in making sure that we had a balanced budget and that we reduced a horrendous debt that was left to us .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
some hon. members :
i know of no greater honour .
that seems perfectly reasonable .
CALGARY DECLARATION
Mr. Speaker , studies produced by the Department of Finance , the Bank of Canada , and virtually every reputable economic authority in Canada and abroad indicate that payroll taxes reduce jobs and reduce job growth .
there was also Minister Dingwall .
Mr. Speaker , this question is particularly irresponsible , and the answer is no .
over the course of this Parliament , the Government will fulfil the commitments it made to the people in its election platform .
then we can have an honest debate within the narrow bounds the government has laid out about how much money should go to taxes and debt retirement .
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member , but his time has expired .
it is an innovation that was created by the Liberal government in the last Parliament to allow opposition members and government members to provide greater substance to bills .
that essence of caring has given Canadians for the first time in a long time a real sense of hope , optimism and confidence about the future .
i hope it can do in the 21 st century for our economy and our country what the investment after World War II in post - secondary education did for our returning soldiers , for our economy and our country in the last half of the 20 th century .
Mr. Paul DeVillers ( Simcoe North , Lib . ) :
the Speaker :
they are both good people .
hon. Fred Mifflin ( Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State ( Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Gary Lunn
Mr. Randy White
now this prime minister promises to put 50 percent of any surplus into a special fund and to pay down the debt and give tax relief from that account while continuing to spend at record levels .
the question becomes :
these changes are consistent with the majority recommendations put forth by the Western Grain Marketing Panel .
a lot of people live in the forest regions and in the areas rich in resources , which are usually found in north .
the government predicts that we shall see the deficit eliminated well prior to the end of this mandate .
well I do not think so .
the Leader of the Opposition in his speech often quoted one of my political heroes , Wilfrid Laurier , but by doing so was able to betray this great statesman by carefully selecting words to bolster his weak arguments .
in my opinion the nays have it .
BCE INC.
Mr. Nelson Riis :
motion for concurrence
there will be debate in committee .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :

one out of three Canadian jobs is directly tied to trade .
the government has stated very clearly that the level of unemployment among our young people is far too high .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
the information highway covers quite a distance .
Mr. Mac Harb
there is a merchant in my constituency who trades in rare artefacts from around the world .
i look forward to seeing all members there this evening .
we would have been equally open to the charge that we were -
i agree with some members who have proposed a debate on the repayment of the debt .
the government only releases the results of public opinion polls when it wants to .

hon. Sergio Marchi
ours is a pluralistic society .
i think he is rising on a point of debate .
i declare the amendment lost .
i could go on but the list kind of makes me just as sick as it does the folks at home watching this .
in a recent CBC interview ComDev CEO , Val O ' Donovan , indicated that he decided to venture into Hull when many others were leaving because " people who have good , exciting jobs are less likely to get involved with marching up and down whether it is labour , political or whatever kind of cause '' .
Mr. Brent St. Denis ( Algoma - Manitoulin , Lib . ) :
i do not think many Canadians could find satisfaction in what they heard in that speech the other day , in particular when we note that Canada is going through a high rate of sustained unemployment .
does CPP really stand for cowardly parliamentary procedure ?
this instrument has definitely , and unfortunately , not been overused .
i believe that is true today , a solution that can only be found through optimism , co - operation , partnerships , hope in our future and belief in ourselves , a solution that will keep Canada the best country in the world .
Mr. Yvon Godin
Mr. Minister -
this I find fitting , because it corresponds to the expectations of the people of Anjou - Rivi 猫 re - des - Prairies , whom I represent .
the motion must be defeated and the government congratulated , not condemned , for its practical and doable election promise .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
Simcoe - Grey is a riding that leads in agricultural excellence .
Mr. Werner Schmidt
a lot of people had it in mind that there was an important issue of taxes that needed to be addressed and they cast their ballot on that .
unfortunately it just was not to be .
it would be wrong in the mythology of the sovereignist movement in Quebec to imagine that somehow members of Parliament from outside Quebec at that time did something in the face of opposition from Quebec as they understood it .
they gave us the information .
Mr. Speaker , I want to ask a question of the Minister of Finance , who says he is very keen about the democratic system .
frankly , excuse us if we are a little jaundiced , but we have heard the same words in the past and seen exactly the contrary .
the innovators dragged through this process have come to recognize that sustainable competition really means market control through government selection and restriction .
Mr. Speaker , I can assure this house and my hon. colleague that all government contracts are awarded by public tendering , open to all .
i felt strongly about that particular issue .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
they came to find a haven from racial prejudice in a country renowned for its tolerance and equality .

hon. Ralph E . Goodale
the throne speech sets the government ' s directional course and lays out the priorities for this Parliament .
there is no limit to how much money companies can give .
as a matter of fact , the government will increase its financial assistance to provinces beyond the budgeted level .
i look forward with great anticipation to the challenges and victories we will achieve in this , the 36 th Parliament .
all these members and a number of others from the Reform Party voted in favour of a division supporting a Senate bill and against an amendment made by a member of the House .
the future of every Canadian is brighter because of the achievements of the last four years .
i do not know if opposites attract or what , but I have a question for the member .
Mr. Monte Solberg :
i say apparent because like most of the rhetoric coming from the government , all is illusion .
the bill is about five basic principles .
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :

there is a means of handling this situation .

Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
money LAUNDERING
that would be an interesting part to his speech which he really did not get into that much .
it was an all or nothing question .
he talked in his speech about things that he had not heard the government say .
that is the new fact which makes this a very legitimate question of privilege .
look , I was interrupted by two points of order .
if it becomes apparent to the committee that it can hear all the interested parties in a shorter period of time , there is nothing preventing that committee from reporting earlier .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
for the past 30 years this country has been fiscally abusing the future of our children .
Canadians dislike unfairness .
this is a good thing , but we have to make sure that those who will have to live with the new plan can do so under acceptable conditions .
today as we consider the Canada pension plan , my constituents and Canadians in general would be shocked to hear some of the statements that are being made by members opposite .

after these three periods , to ensure that the fund ' s investment in provincial securities is in keeping with market practices , new CPP funds offered to the provinces at market rates will be in line with the proportion of provincial bonds held by pensions funds in general .
i hope he is suggesting that we have to look at the way we are spending those moneys .
today ' s motion is just another rather transparent attempt to camouflage the meanspirited , survival of the fittest Reform ideology .

* * *
however , we expect that when Canada enters the next millennium it will be a country where all Canadians and all provinces are treated equally , fairly and with respect .
if I took the time to mention all those who have been interested in this issue since the early eighties and who hope we can modernize Quebec ' s school system , you would see that everyone in our province supports this change .
a key objective of our economic agenda must be to ease the uncertainty of those Canadians who need to adjust to the changing economy and , at the same time , to help every Canadian take advantage of emerging opportunities and realize their full potential .

why should be believe in the judgment and in the sentencing that happens in 1997 if the judge says there should be no parole for 25 years , such as in the awful case of Bernardo ?
the CEO should definitely be elected from the board , by the board of directors , as in any other format .
our government is very proud to have been the instigator of a project which , while creating jobs , also supports and helps -
here too , he can go on about how unemployment is down .
Mr. Jean Dub 茅 ( Madawaska - Restigouche , PC ) :
we have the friendly giant across , the hon. member from Munchkinland .
first , as we mentioned , the proposed Constitution was never signed by any Quebec government , whether federalist or sovereignist .
the hon. member for Nanaimo - Cowichan .
where is the economic initiative that uses the new tools of expanding trade , of beating down internal barriers to trade , of expanding trade with New England and of making Atlantic Canada the gateway to European trade with the American community ?
all we are asking is that the question be clear , and we will take steps to see that it is .
criminal CODE
therefore I will take that under advisement .
Mr. Philip Mayfield ( Cariboo - Chilcotin , Ref. ) :
we know nothing about any involvement by any Canadian in the matter .
the minister did exactly the right thing .
Canadians desperately need tax relief which will in turn spur job growth .
this is the first period of sustained youth employment growth since May 1990 .
( motion agreed to , bill read the second and third times and passed )
the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer , with the government across the way and its reforms , particularly the employment insurance reform , which is impoverishing the poor still further .
will this give them some confidence ?
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of the Environment .
the Speaker :
this is only one example of where they have broken their promises .
we all know the appalling numbers .
surely the hon. member for Bourassa will want to rise in his place and -
fourteen percent of one ' s income is too high and we know that .
i have much to learn about Mr. Crouse ' s record of persistence and fighting for his constituents .
it embodies the values Canadians share and ensures a fair redistribution of wealth .
Mr. Speaker , the issues facing the Stony people are of grave concern to me .
the list of contributors to the Liberal Party of Canada includes the six major banks , which gave more than $ 40,000 .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand
there are ongoing pilot projects to ensure that those needs have been met .
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) :
we can continue to build a country of which we can all be proud .
in other words , I think it is very important for this Parliament , which is going to be dealing with constitutional problems and approaches that have never been dealt with by this Parliament , to establish tests that will be applicable to virtually any situation that we may be confronted with , and not to get into a situation where we apply one set of tests to one type of constitutional amendment and then another set to some others .
family Service Canada in partnership with Health Canada is working to improve the well - being of the family .
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett :
we found that the health protection branch had far fewer human resources than its U.S. counterpart .
it is clear there are some important issues .
it is the first time that we have ever had five parties .
once the budget is balanced , half of each billion dollar budgetary surplus will be used to cut taxes and reduce the debt .
it is important for the hon. member to understand that we all have to do our bit to help the unemployment rate and help the country .
during the last forty years , the politicians have failed miserably with their top - down approach to unifying the country .
i agree .
however before we go off the deep end and make all kinds of assumptions , particularly that the government has wronged and wronged , why do we not just wait for the investigation ?
the government renamed unemployment insurance , employment insurance , but that did not change the want for work or make good on its 1993 election promises .
he was also a superb educator and teacher .
it was an honour to serve you .
what would it take to convince someone to hire that new worker ?
instead it has been balanced on the backs of taxpayers , Canadian families , and their backs are getting really sore .
if a significant majority of producers vote in favour of including something in the wheat board , are they not the ones to make that decision ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano
in the area of new partnerships with the provinces , with the private and voluntary sectors , and with Canadians the government has made a commitment to our young people .
it being 6.47 p.m. , this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
bilingualism
this is also a country that saw its health care and social spending slashed unilaterally , without consultation .
around the world barriers are coming down , markets are opening up and opportunities are being created which were simply unimaginable a few years ago , opportunities which are absolutely critical to Canada ' s continued economic prosperity .
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to present a petition from my constituents who point out that they are opposed to the potential legislation on dietary supplements that would significantly and very negatively impact on the health and well - being of thousands of Canadians , especially the elderly and the chronically ill .
also he made comments about tax reform .
however until the Senate is reformed , this resolution has to pass the Senate as it is , so we do not intend to quibble over Senate representation on the committee .
the sense is that if we partner together effectively , if we build a relationship with First Nations and ask for their input and advice on taking the recommendations of the royal commission and building a plan of action together , engaging the provinces and the private sector , including Canadians in that process , we will find the solutions we need to ensure that aboriginal people are able to benefit from the wealth and prosperity of Canada .
- for a New Century of Canadian Achievement
an opportunity once more
Mr. Bill Blaikie
the use of two official languages , the thriving of the French language not only in Quebec but the unparalleled demand for the language in our schools across the country is a testimony to Cartier and his vision .
that is why Canada must always help to write the rules and not walk away from the table where the rules are being written .
Mrs. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) :
we are trying to save every month for their education .
( the House divided on the amendment , which was negatived on the following division : )
many governments in the past have shifted this on to other administrations .
as well , the number of gun - toting fishing officers is ever increasing .
new Zealand which has a similar parliamentary system introduced citizens rights to initiative and referendum in 1990 .
i am asking the Liberal government to correct this error and to restore to my riding the services to which my constituents are entitled .
they will go to the CPP fund and will be used to pay for benefits down the line .
the CPP is of real importance to all Canadians , and the Liberal government turned its back on them today by refusing to allow the debate to continue .
they have entered into a trust agreement with us .
they have been the subject of consultation through the election .
again I hate to take the time of the House but I think it is important to read into the record that section so members may have in front of them everything that is being talked about here .
hon. Andy Scott :
CPP funds , for instance , have been lent to the provinces at the rate Ottawa pays on its 20 - year bonds .
therefore 50 per cent of zero is zero , and there is zero for tax relief or debt reduction .
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to support the motion to amend the motion to refer to a joint committee the proposed amendments to section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 .
let us opt out of its pyramid scheme and wrest our money from its corrupting grasp .
the experiences of Canada ' s children , especially in the early years , influence their health , their well - being , and their ability to learn and adapt throughout their entire lives .
madam Speaker , I will keep it brief .
Mr. John Harvard ( Charleswood - Assiniboine , Lib . ) :
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
it does .
as Canadians , we extend our deepest sympathies and prayers to the family of the Princess and especially to her sons , Princes William and Harry .
Mr. Speaker , I listened with great interest to the remarks by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development .
yet it was on a busy day much like this 81 years ago that our predecessors in the House of Commons found themselves in the heart of an inferno .
the day may come - I hope it will , and it will if Quebec ever has a government willing to work for those Quebecers who wish to remain a part of Canada , and they are the majority - when there is a legal and constitutional text to consider as such .
absolutely nothing .
we trust that the government will be open to these ideas , as it says it is open to ideas , particularly if they bear the stamp of extensive public consultation .
i would like to know who is right .
we just do not see that out there .
Ms. Raymonde Folco
" paragraphs ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) of section 93 do not apply to Quebec . "
change it if necessary but keep it .
the last time I checked , this was a democratic country .
will the Prime Minister tell this House whether he has demanded a retraction from his industry minister for his colossal contempt toward Atlantic Canadians ?
as members have returned to the House there is a decrease in the size of the majority of the government which it enjoyed in its first mandate .
i do so with respect , because I hold this institution in respect .
members
the fact is that the CPP reform concerns Canadians more than Quebeckers .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
they do not see us as being particularly overtaxed .
that has not happened .
Jonqui 猫 re , which is celebrating its 150 th anniversary , is a great place to hold this momentous event .
surely not the government of the province of Quebec which in the 1995 referendum argued under the word partnership the value of the economic union of Canada .
what does that mean ?
Mr. Peter Adams
yea .
important as the wheat trade undoubtedly is , it nevertheless leaves our prairie economy in a particularly vulnerable position because it means that we are tied to a one - product economy .
let us not forget that .
what has changed ?
Mr. Speaker , when the last Parliament adjourned we were still fortunate enough to be in the company of Mr. Stanley Knowles , the former member for Winnipeg North Centre .
i believe that is the point which the hon. member wanted to make .
the reality is the likelihood of a person ' s being able to exercise what has become known as the faint hope clause in the Criminal Code has been limited by the fact that now there is a screening process where a judge would have to determine the likelihood of success .
there was a time when they did , no matter which political party was there .
i would like the hon. member to participate in that debate in respect of this matter at this time .
i suggest that when the member says that we need consultation and to put pressure on , the government clearly has the authority to make the changes and bring Canada into the 21 st century .
therefore I would encourage the hon. member not to take it as the final word .
hon. members , I beg to return my humble acknowledgements to the House for the great honour you have been pleased to confer upon me by choosing me to be your Speaker .
Mr. Bill Matthews ( Burin - St.
that was the highest total claimed in a year .
CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
fifty per cent of budgetary surpluses will go to investments in social and economic priorities and fifty per cent will go to tax reduction and debt repayment .
there is one other dimension of Mr. Knowles ' life and career that we should not lose sight of in praising his accomplishments as a social democrat .
the time for questions and comments has expired .
the governor in council will have to consult the 14 other directors already sitting on the board in order to appoint number 15 , who will become the president .
i want this member ' s response to that and I want that to be a responsible response .
we need to let Canadians , including Canadians who choose to invest in their future , create businesses and hire their neighbours , to make their own choices .
remember when the Tories were in power , which was not so long ago , all kinds of scandals broke out .
i think this applies not only to the people in my riding , but to all ridings , because even if the program is the creation of the south shore ACEF it will be available to all the ACEFs in the various regions of Quebec .
it is made up of the communities of Richmond Hill , the home of the largest observatory east of the Rocky Mountains and the home of Elvis Stoyko , world championship skater ; the town of Whitchurch - Stouffville , the home of the largest strawberry festival in Canada ; and the northern Markham area , the high tech capital of southern Ontario .
i would therefore like to take a few minutes to acknowledge the people in my riding .
i wish you well .
the Conservative Party leader should know that , when we came to office , the unemployment insurance fund showed an enormous deficit , because the Conservative government had not exercised prudence .
this is why the Bloc Quebecois has insisted for nearly four years now on the need to develop francophone content for the information highway .
i have appreciated working with him in committee .
who bears the brunt ?
he was critical to the success of parliament and the parliamentary internship program .
fisheries
in fact 80 percent of our trade is done by 100 companies .
i have considered you a friend .
i wonder if the member is aware of the situation which is taking place on the Stony reserve in my riding and the headlines that are being made regarding various bands throughout Alberta taking over administrative buildings and making a plea for help .
let me make two very quick references .
this is nothing more and nothing less than hypocrisy .
i have pledged to make this government accountable to them .
Pierre Corbeil , from the Liberal Party , went knocking on the door of the Soci 茅 t 茅 mini 猫 re Raglan and met with one of its executives , asking him for a contribution , a cash contribution , which does not appear anywhere and cannot be traced , to get the project through the maze of the government ' s backrooms .
Mr. Preston Manning
hon. Herb Gray
that is why today we are speaking in favour of the motion put forward by the Reform Party .
it has been said many times that a healthy economy leads to a healthy society .
my motion impacts very positively on a final offer selection arbitration settlement mechanism for west coast ports .
i also campaigned on the personal commitment to bring a new face to politics .
the question which needs to be asked , which was not answered by the parliamentary secretary , is to whom does the money invested and managed by this corporation really belong .
it is the government ' s ability to draw on the strengths of our country ' s differences which will build a stronger Canada .
some hon. members :
last year for the first time I took my family to Europe for a vacation and I had the opportunity to meet a colleague from my childhood in Frankfurt for breakfast .
i want to take a second - and it may sound unusual to some members - to speak about our successes as a country in dealing with our deficits and debts .
the reason is very simple : the federal government ' s cuts in turn reduce the amounts earmarked by the Government of Quebec for health care in Quebec .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
they will be paying higher taxes , higher income taxes , higher payroll taxes and higher sales taxes , to fund the debts and liabilities incurred by the government and by the Progressive Conservative Party when it was in power .
Mr. John Herron
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand
the Bloc Quebecois will also ensure that the government ' s proposed reform does not depart from the principles of social justice so dear to all Canadians and all Quebeckers .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
they also expect us to reinvest in a stronger society .
Mr. Speaker , taxes are too high .
Mr. Ken Epp
that the Address be engrossed and presented to His Excellency the Governor General by the Speaker .
he possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of the complex rules and procedures of this place , so much so that he co - authored several editions of Beauchesne ' s Parliamentary Rules and Forms , the commentary on the standing orders of the House that all members consult almost daily .
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , my concern is the unnamed people that have been subjected to this investigative technique in the past .
could the minister comment with regard to his glowing picture of the position that our economy is in and our society is in with regard to these particular issues ?
under this new idea , which also includes an investment board appointed by the government from the private sector , we see the idea of a very serious transition in the philosophy of the CPP from a pay as you go plan to a partially vested plan .
governments around the world are developing community - based crime prevention programs .
i just have to mention that .
Mrs. Jean Augustine
members
hon. Anne McLellan
if it were not passed by December - and this is why it is important that all political parties , the government , the Reform Party , the Conservatives and the NDP co - operate - it would create a problem for the National Assembly , because its legislation provides that everything should be in effect at the start of the next school year , including the administrative provisions dealing with the boundaries of the school boards ' territory , student registration , and the sharing of existing facilities between the new school boards that will be created .
in the last decade our various political institutions have come under considerable attack , often very subtly , by those who have much to gain if the political institutions of the land can be undermined .
to all those men and women who put their trust in me , especially my family and my husband , I say thank you from the bottom of my heart .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
they have been repeated often and I will repeat them again .
that is the sorry Liberal administrative record .
the House resumed consideration of the motion .
that is a ridiculous statement and is completely out of order .
why is he -
i am sure we will see him again .
that wonderful gesture by the member opposite reminds me of something that George Bernard Shaw once said : " He thinks he knows everything , yet he knows nothing , which points clearly to a career in politics '' .
there are a few cultures and religions in the world which allow multiple wives or husbands .
i share the member ' s concern .
in my time around here as the member of Parliament for Algoma - Manitoulin I have learned that ultimately voters want to know their governments and representatives care about them and their communities .
in the last few years however concerns have been expressed about the viability of the Canada pension plan .
( the House divided on the motion , which was agreed to on the following division : )
the Speech from the Throne made clear that one of the three main priorities of the government in the current mandate is going to be health and health policy .
the fact that elected producers form the majority on the CWB will leave the Board less vulnerable to challenges regarding international trade rules from our trade partners .
i fully support the direction the government has pursued .
the people of Bourassa , like all Quebeckers and all Canadians , want a federal system that works better and that meets their needs .
would it not be preferable to let Canadian businesses and employers keep their overpayment to the EI fund as well so they could invest in their businesses and hire more people , which would also lead to the creation of a more buoyant economy ?
i support that we should be looking at ways in which we can decrease the bureaucracy inherent in the grain transportation sector .
Mr. Bill Blaikie :
it was very different in February 1957 when my family and I fled the communist dictatorship through landmines .
i do not know how to say this diplomatically or in a parliamentary way but it ain ' t true .
the first obvious way we can help is by ensuring that the principles set out in the Canada Health Act are respected .
it is the one that has developed the most skills in computers , in so many other technical aspects that were not available to us and they are doing well .
he is recognized for his knowledge and his fairness .
suffice it to say I believe the time for change is now .
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs recently suspended an aide involved in a controversial issue , until the investigation into his conduct is completed , in compliance with the spirit of the government ' s code of conduct .
they toasted me and said " Welcome home '' .
politicians are attacked as well and not just on their ideas ; sometimes the person and the business itself .
Mr. Fraser swore me in as a member of Parliament on four separate occasions : in 1968 , 1972 , 1974 and 1979 .
she mentioned something that is of concern to a lot of people right across the country wherever there are Canadian Armed Forces bases .
the member across the way thinks she is living in some dream world with unemployment in her riding at 7 per cent .
he did raise this with me privately and it is a matter which I undertook to discuss with my officials .
for example , when a family problem comes up , does the husband and wife first talk about separating or do they for the love of their family and children sit down and rationally work things out ?
they do not mention that for the most part cuts have been made at the expense of the poorest of the poor .
the only way it becomes sustainable is to make certain that contributions and payouts balance .
the Canadian pipeline industry achieved a 2 % reduction between 1994 and 1995 .
the problem would get worse and worse .
Mr. Speaker -
it was the future that became the driving force in building my family .
high taxes kill jobs .
Mr. Peter Adams
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
if something is wrong then the person or persons will have to face the law .
is the government serious about its commitment to a pharmacare program , or is it just another campaign promise -
bill C - 244 .
* * *
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
some hon. members :
future generations will bear the cost of the changes , because they will have to pay higher premiums , while receiving lower benefits .
i believe it should be in the fields of health and education .
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
therefore , members can easily understand that the latest contribution Canada has made in the area of banning landmines has a very personal significance to me and to many other new Canadians with similar or worse experiences .
it is the movies , television , music , painting , dance and theatre that enable Canadians to laugh , talk and cry together .
Ms. Bev Desjarlais
i would like to take this opportunity to thank all my constituents for the very great honour they have bestowed on me by electing me to represent them in the House of Commons .
the student connections program brings together young people and new technologies .
they have no intention of respecting the wishes of the majority of farmers when it comes to the wheat board .
this planning ahead is a concrete example of how the government will help young people meet the challenges of the job market .
the real measure is what it does for the least fortunate and the opportunities it provides for its youth to lead useful and meaningful lives '' .
despite the consensus forged on this issue , obviously some groups and citizens are worried about the disappearance of denominational school boards .
Mr. Speaker , for the first time in our history a whole generation of Canadians is unsure that it will be able to enjoy the same quality of life that their parents did .
Canadians are in favour of a contributory public pension plan .
we have received a report from the panel and are reviewing its recommendations .
that is because each hon. member who has used the services of the legislative counsels in the past to draft bills knows just how time consuming that is , without the proper resources .
that includes the citizens of Quebec .
some hon. members :
as we know , the Ontario premier , Mr. Harris , said shortly after the Calgary declaration that Quebec was just as unique as Pacific salmon is .
* * *
Mr. Speaker , the second petition is signed by 57 of my constituents .
and that is why they far prefer anything advancing Canadian unity to anything calculated to destroy the country , as one of the Bloc Quebecois members put it , and I am not distorting his words .
i represent a constituency which has young people who attend colleges and universities right across this great land from one province to another .
they are getting varied part time and summer work experience .
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
moneys carefully spent on programs dealing with children from their prenatal period through their elementary school years is crucial to preventing young people from committing that first petty crime , a first crime that can lead very often to a lifetime of criminal behaviour and incarceration at enormous cost to Canada and Canadians .
the prime minister made the unwise decision but Canadians have been paying the price ever since .
i can tell the House that I was also very pleased to see the reference in the throne speech to investing in knowledge and creativity .
i think the Quebec business landscape would not have looked the same , if we consider investments made by the Caisse in Canam Manac , Qu 茅 b 茅 cor , Biochem Pharma , Groupe Vid 茅 otron and Bombardier .
we are $ 100 billion deeper in debt .
if there is one thing on which I think all parties agree , it is that we want to have more jobs in this country .
certainly I agree with her .
criminal CODE
( motion agreed to )
why will they not let the Canada pension plan pass so that we can get on to track two where we can deal with mandatory credit splitting , where we can deal with a number of issues that were raised by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance ?
we must still eliminate the deficit spending and we must still tackle an enormous debt .
agreed .
they do not want to talk about the good news that has been happening out there .
yet , we must ask , can we afford to doubt ourselves when the future of our country is in our hands ?
Mr. Werner Schmidt :
when we look at the over 440 recommendations that are a part of that document , really only 89 are strictly under the purview of the federal government .
* * *
evidently he has not been listening to his leader for the last two or three years .
there is a thriving culture , but francophones living outside Quebec also contribute to that culture .
the exclusion clause is positive and it does acknowledge the needs and the desires of some people to have voluntary inclusion in the program .
has his party given much thought to the fact that if there is going to be any tax reduction that it be in the form of reducing the GST as a way of assisting Canadians from all parts of the country at all levels in the socioeconomic scale ?
i say nonsense .
young people are looking for jobs with a future .
it is a very simple idea that we can help people ' s retirement income by simply leaving more money in their pockets when they retire .
it is a great honour and privilege for me to be here speaking to members today about the people of Dartmouth , Nova Scotia whom I am here to represent .
Mr. Speaker , I think it would be very helpful if the hon. member were able to quote what I said .
he spoke of their independence , their indomitable will , their belief in earning their own keep .
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) :
is the hon. member rising on a point of order on this issue ?
we believe in the public pension plan system .
CALGARY DECLARATION
he is quite right .
he cannot get enough of it .
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to introduce my private member ' s bill in the House today .
this is the highest recognition the Salvation Army awards to a non - Salvationist .
it is strange to hear this expression of concern coming from the Conservatives .
in addition to the fact they are written in such complicated legalese , these bills are always open to legal challenges in the courts .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
as businesses expand they either borrow or raise equity .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
out of 1,010 responses 800 of them said yes , British Columbia should be renegotiating its role in Confederation .
if he did , he only paid lip service to it .
MIRABEL AIRPORT
government EXPENDITURES
i would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Speaker , the hon. member for Niagara Centre , on for his election to that post , as well as the assistant Speakers from Edmonton Southwest and Saint - Lambert .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
in committee we elected our chairman .
and of course there was the prime minister ' s insistence on looking like a Chevy kind of guy while he still kept the Caddy .
it is an honour and a privilege for me , as the new elected member for Beauce , to second the motion on the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne moved by the hon. member for Parkdale - High Park .
he has been a very good public servant for a long time .
Mr. Monte Solberg :
in Canada it is still a better process than that which exists , I would say , in virtually every other developed country .
Mr. Speaker , I do not think this caucus would oppose that in any way .
petitions
he was very alert .
could he respond to that please .
the RCMP may have executed a search warrant but no employee of my staff is under investigation at present .
has the Prime Minister even talked to President Chirac in the last 24 hours ?
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) :
in conclusion , we cannot support Bill C - 2 as it does nothing to correct the problems that are currently experienced , but rather introduces measures to make life even more difficult for low wage workers , women , young people , seniors and the disabled .
as is usual , I would like to begin by thanking all those in the riding of Argenteuil - Papineau for their vote of confidence in once again sending me to represent them in this 36 th Parliament .
i would like to ask this minister if he thinks it would not be a laudable public policy for the government to pursue tax fairness for families , that is to say to remove the intrinsic penalty that exists in the current code against single income families , families that choose to keep one parent at home to raise their children .
resumption of debate on Address in Reply
some hon. members :
members
in the old system we did not know .
while there is logic in this reasoning , we fear that the board could in the search for short term flexibility undermine its longer term credibility with farmers .
* * *
the hon. Minister for International Trade .
i will be sharing my time with the member for Shefford .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate what I think was a question from the member for Kelowna .
Waterloo - Wellington captures the essence of Canada .
introduction and first reading
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie ( Louis - H 茅 bert , BQ ) :
it is time it allowed Canadians to come up out of the hold to take control of the ship and turn it around .
it kept many people who wanted to run for the House of Commons from getting here .
our caucus insisted that the government continue these financial guarantees and we are pleased that they have been maintained .
Mr. John Solomon ( Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre , NDP ) :
what is the solicitor general ' s problem ?
Ms. Elinor Caplan
Mr. Bob Speller :
my colleague , the Minister of Human Resources Development , in the last year of the last mandate made a significant contribution to this effort by negotiating with his provincial counterparts the Canada child tax benefit , an investment of some $ 850 million by the Government of Canada toward those who need it most .
how can the prime minister defend a program that the auditor general has pronounced to be such a failure ?
Mr. Speaker , thank you for offering me the opportunity to respond to the member and the usual rhetoric of the Liberal Party of Canada .
* * *
i believe we must recognize as parliamentarians what we are up against in making such decisions .
what hope the government has failed to give , let us inspire so that the 21 st century does in truth belong to Canada .
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon
during the campaign I liked to say that the Liberals have reformed the Tory agenda .
this bill addresses the concerns raised in our national hearings and again we thank the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance for their visionary leadership on the issue .
if the House agrees , I propose that you seek unanimous consent that members who voted on the previous motion be recorded as having voted on the motion now before the House , with Liberal members voting yea .
these people have galvanized support for the right of Canadians to freely choose these products , and they want an answer .
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Reg Alcock :
in the case of a secession , the territory of Quebec would be excluded from the Canadian legal order and from Canadian federal institutions , something which cannot be achieved through such a procedure .
now they have brought it back up to $ 12 billion and are trying to say that they have increased funding for health care .
there are young families out there in which both parents are working and they cannot make ends meet because of high tax levels .
i do not know that any minister could be expected to have the very precise and specific figures we are looking for today .
yesterday the Supreme Court of Canada , although dismissing the stay of proceedings motion , clearly stated that both Chief Justice Isaac and Associate Chief Justice Jerome were tainted by this affair and should have nothing further to do with these cases .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
with its all or nothing inclusion and exclusion clauses , a future board of directors could gradually exclude grades and types of grain until eventually the wheat board would be just a shell that does not market anything .
we established concrete priorities in the throne speech last week to children through further increasing the child tax benefit .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
the government ' s majority was diminished .
that brings me to the point he raised about negative remarks .
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
having gone through this exercise in Alberta and consulted with the people of Alberta , does the member from Calgary agree with the conclusions of this conference that the people of Alberta do not want any more tax cuts , that they want expenditures in health ?
the motion the Reform Party put to this House today , I believe , speaks well for the concerns of the individuals who live in my riding .
but we did not applaud , because we were extremely sad to see such a good program being cancelled .
one of the concerns we have is that it would appear that this may have a very detrimental impact on job creation in the country .
it bothers me to address this in the House because the House deserves better decorum .
while the situation we found ourselves in with respect to the Canada pension plan was nothing that we are particularly proud of , it is not unlike many situations in many countries and in many private pension plans .
during the campaign I had the opportunity to drop in and visit Chester at the DVA in Fredericton .
as members can see there are a variety of concerns .
is there unanimous consent ?
what assurance do we have that it will be our oil and gas ?
do they generally tilt in favour of the union or do they generally tilt in favour of management ?
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) :
internships , apprenticeships and co - op programs are components of any solution .
a motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved
first of all , does the hon. member for Abitibi denounce this Pierre Corbeil ' s schemes ?
Mr. Bill Blaikie
there were 27 corporate contributions during the 1993 election .
the federal - provincial examination will be conducted every three years rather than every five .
for the first three years provinces will have access to half of the new CPP funds that the board chooses to invest in bonds at market rates .
that is why the 50:50 approach worked , because 50 percent will go into social programs including youth where we need it .
it was a new governor general , that is all .
i quote from the same memo :
this is one thing we can all agree on .
* * *
Mr. Speaker , in order to give consideration to the hon. member ' s request , I need to know which bill is being referred to .
this government actually had its mandate diminished .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron ( Verch 猫 res , BQ ) :
i am surprised that the member from Okanagan or even Prince George would actually get up in the House of Commons and address this issue , especially after he and his leader said that they would not move to Stornoway , the residence of the Leader of the Official Opposition , that they would turn it into a bingo hall .
Mr. Stan Dromisky
the prospects of rapid growth in real wages and labour force participation promised that the CPP could be sustained and remain affordable .
it has achieved a reduction of 15 % to the extent that now in the Netherlands the unemployment rate is less than 7 % .
when I gave my constituents the opportunity to fill out the people ' s tax form they told me in no uncertain terms that they did not want their tax dollars spent on official bilingualism , funding for special interests groups , gun registration , foreign aid , multiculturalism , the National Film Board , subsidies to businesses and the CBC .
that grosses $ 23 billion in new government revenues through 36 tax increases on top of the 72 tax increases introduced by the Mulroney Tories .
i am glad my Liberal colleagues here are applauding because this is the throne speech of Brian Mulroney .
we do not need to wait and see .
it is my distinct pleasure to rise in the House today as the newly elected member for the riding of Oak Ridges .
Mr. Speaker , I think it is time for the hon. leader of the New Democratic Party to speak with the leader of the New Democratic Party in British Columbia .
we have increased the funding available to small business under the Small Business Loans Act .
i believe that on the matter of trade , Canada is doing just that .
the RCMP are now investigating a case involving one or two people .
it is with great humility and excitement that I rise today to deliver my maiden speech in the House of Commons .
where is the constitutional resolution to at least start the Senate reform process ?
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
there is a fisheries crisis in Atlantic Canada .
i am proud to be part of this beautiful country we call Canada .
Mr. Speaker , the President of the Treasury Board has made a grave and troubling admission here today .
Mr. Speaker , as I have said in the House before , the appointment process of supreme court justices has served the country very well for 130 years .
Mr. Speaker , I can assure the House that the government is very concerned about the safety of Canadians travelling abroad .
in closing , I want to say it is unacceptable for a so - called democratic society to tolerate such blackmail , to tolerate the existence of a patronage system - I repeat , a patronage system - within the government and the defaming of proud people who help build our regions and do not deserve to find themselves in the middle of such a controversy .
Mr. Dick Harris
i think it is important that Canadians understand that .
of course we remember Mary Clancy and how many times in this House she criticized the United States , how she slammed the Americans .
does he represent them ?
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te
i do recognize the uniqueness of the language and culture of Quebec , but I also recognize the uniqueness of other parts of Canada .
retirement age , which is normally 65 but can be earlier at 60 or later at 70 , will remain unchanged under the Canada Pension Plan and the Quebec Pension Plan .
government GRANTS
there is some unfinished business in the legislation before us .
i wanted to ask the hon. parliamentary secretary to the minister for the wheat board how he explains democracy and I was ruled out of order .
in the government ' s absence , the Reform Party will be there to stand up for them .
we will split our budgetary surpluses on a 50:50 basis over the course of our second mandate .
this piece of federalist propaganda clearly shows the intentions of the current Liberal government : an unprecedented invasion of areas under provincial jurisdiction .
it does not have to adhere to access to information and it cannot be audited by the auditor general of the country .
i would offer to the Deputy Prime Minister the suggestion that we use means , both electronic and written to start the process of communicating to each other , that our history be recognized that there are at least four groups , aboriginal people , French people , English people and immigrant people who experience Canada in their own way .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te
hon. Paul Martin
he was a House of Commons gentleman , a politician , a parliamentarian , and we are better in this country because of his dedication to Canada .
aids
hon. David M. Collenette
earlier I said I am delighted to rise and speak .
he will see that , thanks to federal activities and initiatives , the amount available to Mr. Landry to help the disadvantaged is $ 1.5 billion higher than originally planned by Mr. Campeau .
we expect to achieve this budgetary goal no later than the fiscal year 1998 - 99 .
maybe I am not convincing .
people want governments to plan ahead so we will know exactly how to deal with these rapid demographic changes that will occur .
i was curious to read the throne speech , and I was disappointed when I read it a second time .
given all these facts , I am entitled to believe and to say that partisan interests or influence peddling are behind this unjustified and unjustifiable move .
i am sorry , but , if there is one position here in Canada that requires a person be aware of the issues , it is that of minister , and especially that of Solicitor General .
i would like the hon. member to tell me is he going to help us to take the politics out of infrastructure .
no wonder the provinces are experiencing difficulties now and having to make cuts .
i speak today on their behalf in support of the motion to condemn the government for its empty promises .
in fact , there are about 10 of them that have increased taxes in the years between 1990 and 1995 .
we want a debate .
it is not surprising that our exports flow directly south where many of our trade barriers have already been dismantled .
i have a very short and succinct question to ask .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
this is very disappointing in a country that considers itself a frontrunner when it comes to democracy .
Mr. Speaker , customs staff were pulled away from inspecting planes for drugs and contraband so that Federal Express shipments could be fast tracked .
the 35 th Parliament having been dissolved by proclamation on Sunday , April 27 , 1997 , and writs having been issued and returned , a new Parliament was summoned to meet for the dispatch of business on Monday , September 22 , 1997 , and did accordingly meet on that day .
in the months ahead I will be meeting in a national conference with my provincial counterparts , with interested and knowledgeable people , to talk about how Canadians can be best served by a pharmacare program that will work .
over the last 10 years we have worked assiduously to put systems in place to deal with the kind of problem the member has referred to .
but not for us .
we have to continue to work toward a solution , a compromise , something that will work in this country .
that was their only reason for denouncing these scandals .
that is why I have written to every Canadian municipality inviting their ideas and input on how to renew a united Canada .
Canadians know that we cannot build a fortress and lock ourselves inside .
we certainly have a great deal of concern with respect to how it will affect women in particular .
it is time to go to the people on a fundamental decision such as that and ask them directly .
the government is also working hard to prevent the many diseases and illnesses that are very costly to treat once diagnosed .
we are prepared to listen to their arguments , to their discussions and to their points .
that this House condemn the government for making their 50 / 50 election promise on any future surpluses without adequate public debate as to the optimal size of government , taxes , and debt , thus threatening to repeat Canada ' s 27 year old history of irresponsible spending , creating high debt , financed by high taxes , causing high unemployment .
Kitchener is fortunate to be a part of Canada ' s technology triangle comprised of high tech companies located in Kitchener - Waterloo , Cambridge and Guelph .
the authors found that the main cause of the jobless recovery has been excessively high wage growth .
many of them are badly designed , unsustainable and even dysfunctional .
it will require reaching out .
i do not know if these people have any political affiliation .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
i want to thank my constituents for sending me here and for placing their trust in me .
it will not .
as it is , Bill C - 2 addresses this by proposing marginal increases in contribution rates to be phased in over a period of seven years .
i only hope that I can , in whatever modest way , meet the aspirations and expectations of my constituents of Calgary Southeast .
the board ' s deliberations will be public .
i also want to ensure the member that we have a fairness code in Revenue Canada and we are committed to the fairness code .
hon. Paul Martin
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the prime minister .
world TEACHERS DAY
they want lower taxes and they want real jobs .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay :
what impact will it have on the ability of the country to produce jobs ?
Mr. Speaker , Morris Bodnar , Georgette Sheridan , Bernie Collins , Gordon Kirkby , Marlene Cowling , Jon Gerrard , Elijah Harper , Glen McKinnon .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member for Chicoutimi .
bill C - 218 .
i personally am delighted to see both of them back because they will add a dimension to the debate that was sadly lacking in the last Parliament .
Mr. Rahim Jaffer :
in addition , the Globe and Mail speaks of the plans already under way .
canada is great because of the diversity of all of its cultures collected together .
i am simply proposing that the same system and rules apply to the destruction of livestock under any natural disaster circumstance .
that the Standing Committee on Industry be the committee designated for the purposes of section 33 of an act to amend the Business Corporations Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts ( Chapter 24 , Statutes of Canada , 1994 ) .
Mr. Paul Steckle ( Huron - Bruce , Lib . ) :
it was , rather , to prevent or to act in a preventive way against the government moving to the question right away by not putting up speakers .
he always provides thoughtful questions .
it is utter bureaucratic nonsense that does not address the concerns of the people .
Mr. Speaker , the minister has not answered my question .
Mr. Speaker , I think you will find unanimous consent for the following motion :
the member should note a study which was just done for the Bank of Nova Scotia , certainly not a partisan institution in this country .
they also want to set up some ten or twelve programs with a national slant , what they call Canada - wide programs .
i quoted the Prime Minister who said that Canada was " the best country in the world in which to live '' .
think of the thrill he must have felt as a young man when he appeared on the same stage as J . S . Woodsworth , one of the founders of the CCF , and Mr. J . Coldwell , the national leader at that time .
an hon. member :
Mr. Speaker , Quebec is a fine province that we are proud to have as part of Canada .
that is the position of the member for Calgary Southwest of the Reform Party .
public WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES
he is absolutely right that as we liberalize trade around the world , as we look to liberalize the Americas or APEC or get closer to Europe or the United States , that somehow in a very contradictory way these ancient walls still exist in Canada .
we made our priorities clear in the election campaign and in the speech from the throne .
i would urge the government to take a look at those things I have outlined that are specifically of importance to Windsor .
to the heroes and heroines du Saguenay et de la rivi 茅 re Rouge , please stand .
indeed last week the Governor of the Bank of Canada said , " Canada is in better shape now than it has been for many years to face the economic challenges of the future '' .
perhaps there would have been a different public reaction on June 2 , and perhaps the government would not be where it is today .
the auditor general found that information which the regional development programs supplied to him was inaccurate and incomplete .
* * *
but does he really think that spending $ 1.5 million to subsidize smokes for convicts is the best way to spend the money that he has siphoned out of Canadian small businesses ?
Mr. Gerry Byrne ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources , Lib . ) :
i would remind members today that we are debating a Reform motion which reads :
Mr. Paul Steckle
i think it has much more to do with the kind of society we want for ourselves , our children and our grandchildren .
the Quebec resolution reads as follows :
this has been diluted more and more over the past years .
this is a caucus that does not have a single member under the age of 30 talking condescendingly about hope for future generations , which it has forever indebted and made poorer because of the choices of the government to add $ 100 billion to the public debt and the previous government , of which this Prime Minister was an integral member , created the debt to begin with .
it is giving reasons why the House would not proceed with the Bill .
does he not think that doubling the Canadian government ' s debt load and imposing a mismanaged GST on the Canadian economy , both actions having been taken by the Conservatives while in power , helped create many problems , including the pension problem ?
what kinds of checks are we doing at our border with our own passports and foreign passports ?
all Canadians can count on an indexed pension so their income and quality of life will not be eroded over time .
the majority of Canadians clearly wants a public plan which demonstrates a basic retirement benefit for all workers and shares some risk of disability and death .
hon. David Anderson
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
surely patient care must always come before profit .
one of the reasons why they failed to stick with this issue was because they talk about the tax grants to social organizations , but the real tax grants in this country are the tax expenditures that are buried in the 1,500 pages of the tax act and most of those tax grants go to large multinational organizations .
say it again , $ 4.3 million .
the Speaker :
NIAGARA GRAPE AND WINE FESTIVAL
infrastructure
suspension OF SITTING
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
such arrangements help explain the support garnered by the reform sought by the Quebec authorities .
i should have gone back to the hon. member after the comment made by the member for West Nova .
it will be an unequalled opportunity to show ourselves and the world the richness of our diversity , the strength of Canadian values , and the great promise of our future in the 21 st century .
unless it happens in Ontario it seems that it does not matter .
contributing to CPP is not paying tax .
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) :
surely the will of our constituents takes precedence over these earlier precendents he quoted .
this consultation would , therefore , have to be transparent , and carried out in such a way that everyone may grasp the issues and that all strata of society may have a chance to be heard .
absolutely not .
that is what the government needs to start doing and that is certainly what the Reform Party would do .
there is a strategy in place .
Canadians take very great pride in our country ' s social stability and in the security that we enjoy .
this fall I will be making in the House of Commons the first annual statement on organized crime to report on the implementation of the anti - gang legislation , Bill C - 95 , and our efforts to improve co - ordinated enforcement .
this is what it says about what is happening in this country .
the ENVIRONMENT
Ms. Wendy Lill
bill C - 213 .
i wish him vision and resolve to stay the course of trade liberalization which has meant so much to Canada in the last 10 years .
last February in the House of Commons the Minister of Finance tabled the first draft of the CPP legislation .
what does the minister intend to do to tighten up protection of Canadian passports so that such situations do not recur ?
our debt and deficit problems are due to a deliberate economic policy of fighting inflation with high interest rates .
i saw people such as the former minister of finance , Don Mazankowski , as well as others , there .
Canadian analysts including Wood Gundy ' s chief economist charge that the government ' s endorsement of last week ' s interest rate hike is " like waging war on yesterday ' s problem '' .
income TAX CONVENTION IMPLEMENTATION ACT , 1997
it takes some gall to talk about an even tighter social union and education , when , like this minister , one has sat in the National Assembly as an assistant to a former education minister .
it was quite contagious .
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate you on your appointment .
a message was delivered by the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod as follows :
the government must change its approach and be more open to change .
Mr. Speaker , given the fact that the province of Newfoundland and Labrador continues to suffer from having the highest unemployment rate in all of Canada , which at 20 percent is more than double the national average , it is only proper that this Newfoundland tragedy be described for what it really is , a national disgrace .
as of last August , there were between 12,000 and 13,000 Quebeckers in this situation .
Mr. Speaker , I find it astonishing that a former member of the House is not familiar with the Standing Orders .
it is for these reasons that the government is taking decisive action to help young people .
* * *
at a time when the provinces are experiencing difficulties , the federal government is blessed with a better than expected income and is about to start playing Santa Claus again because there is a provincial election coming in Quebec , and because that election will be followed by a referendum .
Mr. Yves Rocheleau ( Trois - Rivi 猫 res , BQ ) :
it amazes me that the parliamentary secretary , although I appreciate the effort he is making , has written answers already to questions which he did not really know were coming .
i will have an announcement in Toronto tomorrow that will deal with this very matter .
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
we have made some very substantial investments and I will give you just a few examples .
Mr. Speaker , during the 1993 election campaign , we said we wanted to improve the free trade agreement , and we improved it in areas including the environment , labour and other sectors as well .
i do not see it .
if it does , let us recognize that as long as it tolerates more than one million children living in poverty it will have to wear on its shoulders what the Conference of Catholic Bishops reminded us is a form of child abuse .
i would also like to add that the federal government is currently engaged in broad based dialogue with a number of groups on other aspects of Canada ' s retirement income system .
on a point of order , the hon. member for Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre .
tax relief , that is what we are talking about .
if a majority vote yes and the other two conditions , which I will deal with later , are met , then all canola growers will have to join the Canadian Wheat Board .
health
the message to Quebecers , to all French - speaking Canadians , indeed to all Canadians , is one of openness and solidarity .
that is amazing .
the question is on the amendment to the amendment .
i congratulate my colleagues for putting forward their vision and speaking to the throne speech document which I think shares the vision of hope , confidence and nation building that should permeate this place .
if someone is experiencing a serious disability and is unable to work , do we really want to make it more difficult for them to receive benefits ?
i as minister will ensure we do that for all Canadians so that we have fairness -
in addition to a general media briefing , all members of Parliament and senators have been sent two copies of an information package on the MAI .
canada ' s rich and diverse natural heritage is also a source of national pride and international acclaim .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for raising that question .
will he finally stand up for B.C. fishers and coastal communities and come through with the full $ 30 million promised by his predecessor and a commitment to stable long term funding ?
he did not see the key themes .
however , they are also telling me that they are at their limit in terms of program elimination and cost recovery .
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 I am very pleased today to present a petition in the House from a number of my constituents and other people in the London area .
they expect government to plan for the future in the same way Canadians plan for their future .
in this Parliament we must not throw ideas out in a general sense .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
agreed .
our legislation on which we have a consensus of the vast majority of the provinces does not affect people who are disabled .
i can see several Liberal members of this House who are nodding to indicate that they would be in agreement with such a bill .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
i would rule that in this particular case there is no question of privilege .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
since the ratification of the Senate is required under section 43 of the Constitution Act of 1982 , it must play a role in this exercise .
i do not know why the minister was so particularly anxious about receiving a question from the NDP that he used up all the time .
as to the allegation that the minister might have been reading from a blank piece of paper , the minister is a man of integrity and would not participate in any such activity .
statements BY MEMBERS
the electorate has elected its government and its opposition .
they asked us to preserve the Canada pension plan .
unfortunately it is ceremonies such as the annual memorial service that make us realize our safety has come sometimes at the cost of those who are working , the best and the brightest that we have in these forces .
as you can see , there are many proposals and projects on the go with the Government of Canada and the provinces and this will continue as we help students get an education in Canada .
furthermore only the party to which I belong is calling for immediate tax cuts .
multiculturalism should not be about money .
will the government change its current policy to permit the unrestricted use and access to safe alternative health products instead of making criminals of ordinary Canadians ?
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
let us talk about this ethics commissioner .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
what is this government waiting for to end this abuse and put people back to work ?
Mr. Speaker , why will the letter not be tabled ?
i believe it only makes sense that we use this standing order to allow ourselves the opportunity to debate this particular agreement , to hear what the government has to say and to hear what other members of Parliament have to say on this very important matter .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
government ORDERS
now they will be able to see where their money went .
Mr. Speaker , it is opposition members who are refusing to have a real debate .
when one drives east along Bow Trail toward city centre one cannot help but admire the concrete and steel of Calgary ' s new downtown rising up toward the blue sky of Alberta .
Mr. Joe Jordan ( Leeds - Grenville , Lib . ) :
Mr. Daniel Turp :
these two programs are working to connect 5,000 rural communities like the ones in Perth - Middlesex plus all of Canada ' s schools and libraries to the Internet by 1998 . Affordable Internet access is particularly important to a rural community where improved communications links will open up new opportunities for job creation , trade and economic growth .
i also want to thank him very much for coming to visit the school children in my riding in his capacity as secretary of state .
the minister tries to make a silk purse out of a sow ' s ear , a feat beyond the competence of this minister .
* * *
this is a sure fire way to discourage the youth of today , stifle job creation and stifle economic growth .
as the member representing the Minister of Industry at this event and a teacher by profession , I have seen for myself that we need not worry about the next generation of Canadian scientists .
second , the CPP provides protection not available through private RRSPs , such as disability benefits , provision for women of childbearing age and survivor and death benefits .
they should be setting targets for the reduction of unemployment just as they have set targets for deficit reduction .
we must remember that they are our foremost responsibility .
the government needs to show leadership through co - operative domestic regulation and aggressive global negotiations to allow the industries committed to the future to prosper and grow .
after more than a week our questions remain outstanding and unanswered .
it will depend on the demographic shifts in our country .
there are more poor children today in Canada than there were when this government was elected .
in practice whenever that is done , a sort of provincial constitution with additional safeguards for the rights of the citizens of that province is being created .
it is also the safest time to travel in these parts .
they cannot be sued for statements they make in the House .
i would also like to ask for the patience of the members in the House to thank the people of Hillsborough for returning me to this place as their voice in the House of Commons .
the auto pact has reached an almost sacred position in our community because the auto pact is the engine that allows those industries to exist , to prosper and employs our citizens .
successive governments have tinkered and cut social programs under the rubric of a user pay mentality with the result that they are breaking social contracts between generations .
it was a Canadian who discovered insulin .
the Speaker :
we could say so what , and many people do say that .
there are businesses out there that would hire these younger workers we are all concerned about except that the government is charging excessive payroll taxes , and the throne speech did not promise a cent of tax relief to those families or those businesses .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the health minister .
i cannot believe that my good from from Prince George is not giving the Liberal Party and ourselves the credit for that .
but since they are unelected and therefore unaccountable to no one but the prime minister who appointed them , they have no legitimacy .

in the days following my election in November 1993 , we had talks with the American and Mexican governments .
we also have a foreign policy , and social responsibilities .

here is how to get preferential treatment from the Liberals .
but in today ' s dynamic and changing marketplace , producers have made it clear that they want the Canadian Wheat Board to be more accountable to them .
while the Canada pension plan is a federal pension plan in the eyes of the people , the reality is that it is a federal - provincial plan .
in my own riding Durham College has a science and technology program with an enrolment of 700 students .
Mr. Speaker , I rise , on this first full sitting day of the 36 th Parliament , to reiterate my call to the Ontario government for an independent public inquiry into the July Plastimet fire in Hamilton .
last Friday , the Minister of Public Works admitted that more than 35 % of government contracts , totalling some $ 3 billion , were untendered .
however , it is important for us to note a few things .
members
we know from the QPP , public pension funds , the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund , and other avenues of government managing money how unlikely it is that political considerations will not get in there sooner , later , last , first and always .
we see this through the dismantling of so much of our transportation system , whether it is the privatization of air and sea ports , the privatization of the CNR , the abandoning of branch lines in western Canada or the doubling of freight rates in the post Crow era .
they claim we are ripping off the taxpayer , but the funds generated by this premium increase will not be put into a general revenue fund .
i would like him to rise in the House and confirm that he did indeed inform the Office of the Prime Minister that an investigation was under way into the allegedly illegal actions of a Liberal Party fundraiser .
Mr. Speaker , my point of order refers to question period and a question raised by the Liberal member for Oak Ridges and directed to the Minister for International Trade .
BRITISH COLUMBIA
it was not followed through in the courts .
i say to you , sir , that we have to realize that .
it will be a tax deductible contribution by Canadians .
since we invest enormous amounts of money in the well - being of our children , we feel it is very important to measure their progress , so that when they go to school , they are in the best possible position to learn .
it is terrible to see a government that calls itself democratic refusing to let the debate continue , in this House , to get to the bottom of things .
we will work closely with the provinces to strengthen our health system following the excellent suggestions of the National Forum on Health .
the LATE CLAUDE ELLIS
Mr. Speaker , I would hate to point out to the member that they won a majority government but with the smallest percentage of popular vote in Canadian history for a majority government .
having spoken about the CPP fund ' s proposed investment practice , I would like to take a moment to reassure anyone who has wondered about the impact of the new fund on Canadian capital markets .

Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration .
Mr. Rick Laliberte
Mr. Speaker , since April when the auditor general ' s information became knowledge to my department , officials have put in place measures to try to combat the weaknesses that were outlined by the auditor general .
Mr. Walt Lastewka
before long we will have the ability to make decisions based on our people ' s needs rather than those of the international bankers and bond holders .
these Liberals do not like to talk about the debt .
i will bring forward concerns of people and groups in my role as deputy critic of intergovernmental affairs .
Mr. Peter Adams
the Liberals have more tricks in their bag .
was it not the same parties that said we could never balance the budget ?
organ DONORS
then the World Bank stepped in and helped them to recover .
i dedicate my remarks to my parents , Katherine Earle and the late Maurice Earle , both of whom taught me the importance of a belief in God our creator , a belief in oneself and a belief in and respect for one ' s fellow human beings .
our goal is to balance the books and then to spend 50 percent on investment in people and programs .
speech FROM THE THRONE
they are deductible in a similar way that CPP contributions are tax deductible investments in the future .
points OF ORDER
section 93 ( 1 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 , states :
we are also acting to improve the stewardship of the Canada pension plan and to enhance public accountability .
we live in a changing technological world .
reformers strongly believe that social benefits must be focused on those who truly need them and must be delivered in a compassionate manner .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
my question for the natural resources minister is why is the government threatening the viability of this project by constantly changing the regulation .
we will be able to make them feel more comfortable about their future , that programs will be there when they need them , particularly health care .
Mr. Speaker , in keeping with your efforts to maintain decorum in the House I felt it was inappropriate that this occurred .
this bill would require the recipients of grants of public funds for cultural projects to acknowledge that a grant has been made .
the Liberals have closed more hospitals in the country than any provincial government , yet they say that they care about Canadians .
the Speaker :
Mr. Ken Epp :
there are people in the Conservative Party who are eligible to collect $ 4.3 million .
the Speaker :
the then Speaker said :
quite literally they are the future of our country .
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan :
in my first term as the member of Parliament for Oxford I asked myself what I could do to assist in unifying our nation .
they told me they wanted the government : first , to continue to support job creation and economic growth ; second , to reinvest in social programs ; and third , to settle the issue of national unity by taking into account Quebec ' s distinct and unique reality , but in co - operation with the rest of the country .
what was so distressing and the reason I got into politics was the fact that the politicians of the day , especially the Conservative politicians , would not listen to the people .
can the minister tell the House how Lai Tong Sang , the Macao Triad leader who received landed status in Canada , slipped through the stranglehold the minister has on organized crime ?
we want a debate .
Mr. Jack Ramsay
the government is not interested in how useful or effective these programs will be .
this is a time when government must make hard choices about how to use scarce health funds .
so much anger in central Canada about a government policy would have this regionally oriented government scurrying to make amends .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , somehow I knew they would justify gouging taxpayers .
however , with respect to the referendum process and the taking away of rights of a minority group , that was of great concern to me .
i was here 25 years ago making a speech in this House in 1972 as a Conservative member of Parliament .
it is an influence whose strength and vitality in the 21 st century is like that of Atlantic Canada in the 19 th century and Quebec and Ontario in the 20 th century .
some parties might be unhappy about that , but it applies .
Mr. Speaker , it is very clear what has happened .
hear , hear .
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 83 ( 1 ) I wish to table a notice of a ways and means motion respecting the imposition of duties , of customs and other taxes to provide relief against the imposition of certain duties and taxes and to provide for other related matters .
it has been applauded by most Canadians .
i am happy to correct the hon. member .
and why is that ?
the hon. member , in his thoughtful presentation , referred to the plight of Canada ' s children .
during our first mandate we established a prenatal program and increased the Canada child tax benefit by $ 850 million a year .
there is another problem because , as he also well knows having been here before , there are many issues that come before this House that were never in a party platform and were never part of any policy material .
where is the proposal for public - private partnerships to build roads and short line railways and container ports ?
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
originally in the legislation eight out of twelve members of the jury had to make that determination .
homes FIRST SOCIETY
after a short return to England my parents emigrated with our small family to Canada .
Mr. Jason Kenney
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
where is the truth in what is happening here ?
yes , we were successful '' .
points OF ORDER
there is the landmark Carnegie Centre on one corner of Main and Hastings and the Four Corners Community Savings opposite .
a country that invests in children successfully will have a better future - .
today Innisfil has a population of 26,000 with many skilled workers who commute to nearby urban centres and many who work in the industrial manufacturing sector of the municipality .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
the government of Canada is already meeting about 60 percent to 65 percent of the cost of students in the universities and colleges through the transfer payments in this country .
it invests annually in programs that enable young Canadians to acquire the knowledge and experience they need to get their careers off to a good start .
while an exhausted government was still running the country , Canada itself was bursting with the new ideas , new energies and new potentials of the 20 th century , and while the government was mired in the past , the people started to seek ways and means to express their frustrations with a government whose time had past .
if they have shown that they have complied with clause 3.12 , then could they not simply prove that in a court of law as other Canadians are required to do without having this other clause 3.13 which basically exempts them ?
the CRTC does this in pursuit of what it calls sustainable competition .
i have known Ron Irwin for a long time .
there are many who say that people in the north are receiving subsidies , but there is one thing that needs to be pointed out to the citizens of Canada and of Quebec and that is that , for every dollar we give our Inuit friends , 97 cents always comes back to the south .
i am not convinced that limiting donations solely to individuals will actually prevent corporations from making donations by giving bonuses or instructions to their employees .
our adversary is confusion .
were the individuals looking to run under the Liberal Party banner in our region involved in this fundraising scheme ?
when I stepped down as provincial leader in Nova Scotia it was my intention to go to Africa , not to go after the top job in the federal NDP .
that is ridiculous .
Mr. Gurmant Grewal
they are inefficient , unaccountable and ultimately they represent , to Canadian taxpayers , money pits .
what about Canadian taxpayers ?
changes in the way benefits are calculated will slightly reduce the pensions of future beneficiaries , reduce health benefits and make it harder to qualify for disabled benefits .
they need to understand that for the first time in a long time Canadians have a great deal of confidence in their government .
it is one of the reasons that we also understand that we cannot get mired down in some of the wacky ideas that we can somehow spend our way out of these problems .
we will implement tax reductions and lower the debt .
well , let us blow $ 105,000 on career markers and personal performance strategy development of expert and novice symphony orchestra conductors and provincial ice hockey coaches .
if she does know , I would like her to point out what the payroll taxes are today as opposed to what they were under a Conservative government .
the Speaker :
i think it is fair to say that there will be a Canada pension plan in the future and those people who say that there will not be are simply fearmongerers .
to achieve this success we have more work to do - work that no one can do alone .
for this reason I am extremely pleased that the Liberal government has continued to support the agricultural community in the form of marketing boards and quotas .
two separate groups of people were given rights under the Constitution of Canada .
as you know , this is the amount that must remain available to meet commitments to those who are entitled to benefits .
Mr. Reed Elley
after merely eight hours it has said " Enough , we are going to close off debate '' .
hon. Sergio Marchi ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
to ensure this we would transfer all CPP funds to a separately managed Canada pension trust as is already done in Quebec .
i invite hon. members , especially him , to pay attention because in the last parliament and in all parliaments we have had Senate public bills debated in the House .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
at this point in my speech , I would like to turn to a subject of great interest to me and one that my party has entrusted me with defending : the status of women .
presence IN GALLERY
we have here a wealth of knowledge .
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to stand in the House today and make some comments on Bill C - 4 .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib . ) :
what counts most for this country ' s future , for its unity and prosperity , for its men , women , young people and families , for its businesses ?
the provinces , Quebec in particular , are tired of this situation .
we try to ensure a level of accountability that will make sure that money is properly spent and spent for community purposes .
the costs of pensions will be spread evenly and fairly across generations .
they will be disappointed .
that is the fairest way to go about doing it .
yet in yesterday ' s speech from the throne his government listed at least 29 new spending measures , but not one single practical measure for either debt reduction or tax relief .
the motion states :
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
we argue that is a new solution that has been untried .
this is perhaps understandable but nonetheless astounding considering the significance of the contribution the resource sector makes to Canadian wealth and employment .
that is not so bad .
that consensus was confirmed during the Estates General on Education in 1996 , which verified that Catholic and Protestant Quebeckers , anglophones and francophones alike , wanted to establish linguistic school boards .

Mr. Monte Solberg
whether to stick to a principle or to represent constituents , the member for York South - Weston whose achievement in being re - elected to the House as an independent I admire , certainly knows the consequences of standing up for a principle .
if , in fact , the Bloc Quebecois agrees on a 50 / 50 share of the anticipated surplus , I would remind the member that there will be no surplus available before the end of the next term of office in four years ' time , barring an earlier election .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to offer my congratulations to you on your appointment as acting speaker .
the people of Canada told me and my colleagues they want to keep it , and so we are .
all we are promising them , as I said in my speech , is that those entering the plan now will get a whopping 2.5 percent return on that huge investment .

madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
Mr. Speaker , the Calgary declaration has been released widely by the media in Quebec , but the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition is welcome and we will study it .
therefore , they are available to everyone .
after careful consideration of the precedents , I conclude that activities related to the seeking of information in order to prepare a question do not fall within the strict definition of what constitutes a " proceeding in Parliament " and , therefore , they are not protected by privilege .
our party believes there is a need for change in the system , but it is how the changes will be made and how they will affect Canadians , low income earners , youth a women .
i know you are doing a very fine job with it .
Canadians under 35 years old do not believe we will have a pension .

canada ' s economy is producing impressive employment growth .
it is going to that sort of a plan .
as long as there is not accountability and open books , as long as there is not accountability in the way their statements are audited and produced , then that area of suspicion grows with every crop that comes off every farm .
in some cases it means providing some training for people .
third , as he probably knows , Canada is one of the few countries which has passed legislation that gives us the right to prosecute Canadian citizens who go abroad to exploit children .
it was emphasized that it was important to support small business and to reduce the amount of official paperwork and red tape that is required for the functioning of a small business .
i would like to thank the Prime Minister and the government for the honour they have bestowed on the people of Parkdale - High Park with their motion .

Mr. Paul Forseth
i support job creation programs , but I have a serious problem when I see that friends of the Liberals , namely bankers , are the ones who will benefit , while ordinary Canadians are still waiting for the Liberals to fulfill their commitments and create jobs for them .
i would say to the government House leader and the government , do not frustrate but rather ensure that standing and select committees have sufficient powers and are vested with sufficient authority to carry out the work ahead .

the Government will build on the progress achieved and the foundations put in place over the last four years to strengthen the economy and increase confidence .
Mr. Wayne Easter :
Mr. Speaker , clearly it would be better to reach a negotiated settlement with the unions .
that is not true .
there must be something in here about what it will do about the 1.4 million people who do not have jobs today .
if I may refer to the terms recently used by the metropolitan Quebec chamber of commerce , concerning an investigation on the job losses in the public service resulting from early retirement policies , it said that the research and development sector was so vibrant in the Quebec City area that those jobs losses were gradually being offset by new jobs in research and development .
both Bill C - 72 and now Bill C - 4 the son of C - 72 , would give the board the ability to buy grains from anyone , anywhere at any time .
the current foreign affairs minister , who may succeed Lester B . Pearson as a Nobel peace prize recipient , did not manage to convince his government to give foreign affairs the importance they deserve in its agenda .
there is some flexibility .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Peterborough , Lib . ) :
the fact that Canada has invented peacekeeping is a reflection and a demonstration of the ethnic diversity of our country .
he should be leading by example if they want to stand up here and talk about taxes .
pay EQUITY
yet we would never have dreamed that we would have to defend democracy , we would never have dreamed that the federal government would stoop so low as to question the very foundations of democracy .
taxes of all kinds can also have a negative impact .
i am proud as well to be part of the government that has now set an agenda for the Canadian people that truly will bring us to the new millennium .
the motion before us today seems like a golden opportunity to emphasize our respect for democracy and our institutions .
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua ( Vaughan - King - Aurora , Lib . ) :
yet a private member comes nowhere near that ability .
like all my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois , I must say I support the government ' s objective of eliminating the federal deficit by the year 2000 .
i was not a politician then , I was just an ordinary citizen , but in my village everyone was against Meech lake and everyone was against the Charlottetown accord .
i know there are those who believe that we should be doing other things , that there are all sorts of wonderful proposals out there .
there would be a better return .
it is an agreement which when arrived at will bind Canada for 20 years .

automation is replacing people with technology .
the poster reads " If you want peace , work for justice '' - `` si on veut la paix , il faut travailler pour la justice '' .
it was the subject of the election campaign .
then all Canadians will feel better about themselves , about their families , about their well - being in senior years , about their justice system , about their government .
the Liberal Party is not the only guilty one .
the Speaker
the Bloc Quebecois will also condemn the fact that Canada is slow to ratify a treaty as important as the American convention on human rights and seems too reserved regarding the inclusion of cultural exemptions in international trade agreements .
this should come as no surprise .
we must also strike a balance between contributing generations by quickly establishing a stable long term contribution rate .
yet prostate cancer , which kills 4,000 men each year , was ignored in the government ' s throne speech .

Ms. Diane St - Jacques ( Shefford , PC ) :
i and my colleagues have always believed that patriotism , a genuine love for one ' s country , is better expressed through actions than through mere words .
in its previous mandate this government committed to Canadians that it would ensure its strong economic fundamentals would be in place in order to promote economic recovery and job creation .
the youngest , at the tender age of four years witnessed his mother ' s killing .
the plan ' s chief actuary has told us that if we do not rebalance the relationship between contributions on one side and payouts on the other , the fund will not last beyond the year 2015 .
in my view it was an attempt to link partisan party activities and the office of the Prime Minister in ways which could lead to the perception that there was some wrongdoing on behalf of the Prime Minister .

hon. Paul Martin
we continue to record huge increases in our trade surpluses .
families want this right , this responsibility and this authority to look after their own children returned to them .
the member did not want me to go on with my notes .
we do not quarrel with that , not at all , but these increases in contributions as I mentioned before must be offset by substantial reductions in taxation for Canadians .
he ' s gone all quiet on us .
the government responds to foreign overfishing off the west coast by taking the B.C. government to court .
this is a very difficult question .
madam Speaker , I congratulate you and wish you well .

creation of this chair is evidence of the Liberal government ' s desire to work in conjunction with our partners in industry , the universities and provincial agencies to develop new knowledge which will improve electrical service and eliminate power outages caused by precipitation freezing on transmission lines .
he has obviously done a great deal of research and a great deal of leg work to have uncovered these inadequacies and injustices that have occurred on this particular point .

along with good health care , adequate income is essential to a decent quality of life in retirement .
how could the member say that I am not answering the question when he does not give me the opportunity to answer the question ?
we have been working for the past ten years to meet this challenge .
some hon. members :
they supported the Liberal members on this side .
i look forward to working with all my colleagues in a constructive fashion that will build on our successes as a country and will make Canada stronger than ever as it enters the new millennium .
when that happens it will be more difficult for them to build schools and hospitals .
is this the best the Liberals could come up with ?
farmers are accountable for delivering the right grain in a timely manner .
the throne speech also warrants praise because it basically reflects the commitments made by the Liberal Party during the last election campaign in red book II , Securing Our Future Together .
today , Mr. Speaker , the minister of agriculture has recognized October as agricultural awareness month in Atlantic Canada .
a fundraising campaign has started and is called " the crowning touch to restore the downtown jewel '' .
has the Prime Minister simply forgotten about the seriousness of the debt or the high tax levels , or is he telling the House that higher spending is the number one fiscal priority of his government ?
our economy is made up of businesses working in very diversified sectors .
usually the interested parties are away from the mine or forestry sites .
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) :
that is a good question and one he should perhaps answer .
port POLICE
the increase is going to incur in terms of contribution but the benefits are not going to increase .
businesses in Canada are beginning to increasingly recognize that they have multi - stakeholder responsibilities .
throne SPEECH
in any case this is still a monopoly the way it is set up .
in the face of serious backroom pressure from her provincial colleagues on Wednesday in Newfoundland , will the minister now pledge to Canadians that she will safeguard the federal role to protect Canada ' s precious endangered species ?
the separatists have no idea what shape the remainder of Confederation will be in after a yes vote .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
he is a very honourable and highly respected man .
Mr. Speaker , everything the government has done since it took office , whether it be re - establishing the credibility of government to bring interest rates down , keeping inflation low , investing in research and development or investing in youth employment , has been directed to the one aim of giving Canadians an opportunity for a better quality of life and greater job creation .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
is there unanimous consent for the proposal ?
it will not be a pension plan that is exuberant but a pension plan that is realistic .
i am prepared to be very flexible and to take the lead from wherever it may come in order to find some kind of a solution to this problem .
in the South Shore of Nova Scotia , we export fish , Christmas trees , paper as well as other forest products , and manufactured goods .
Mr. Speaker , the citizens of Windsor and Essex county raised concerns about not getting timely and accurate warnings of severe weather conditions .
the member has just demonstrated the usual overblown rhetoric used by the Liberal Party of Canada .
the House has heard the proposal of the chief government whip .
we have talked about what we have done for young Canadians , what we are doing for our seniors , and what we are doing for health care in terms of increasing our funding by over $ 6 billion in five years to the provinces to help sustain the principles of the Canada Health Act .

Mrs. Diane Ablonczy
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
i join with the hon. member for Wild Rose and ask that you consider this very serious matter .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
it is important to again state very clearly for the record that it is because of the actions of the government that the debt is on a downward track .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment ?
we are asking the young people to assume a national debt of $ 600 billion and now we are asking them to pay the CPP debt at the same time .
i am pleased and proud that two companies in my riding of Nepean - Carleton , Computing Devices of Canada and Thomson CSF , are actively engaged in leading edge technology for landmine detection and clearance , technology which will save lives .
cultural GRANTS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ACT
in short , the debate must be conducted in a dispassionate manner .
between National Family Week and National Child Day , November 20 , I hope it will finally set its own targets for the reduction of poverty , for the good of our children and of their families .
let us , yes , sprint forward together and continue to build a great country called Canada .
i would ask the member to acknowledge that the federal government did help during the time of the flood .
i would like the hon. member to comment on what he found when he travelled the country , the difference between what Canadians want and what they are actually getting from the justice system .
we are still not meeting that growth and demand .
all of these are fine words , but where are the actions to prevent the illegal use of Canadian passports no matter how or by whom they are used ?
for that reason , and because it will benefit the Quebec community as a whole , the government believes that this amendment should be passed .
they want the government to focus on children and youth .
Mr. Speaker , recent reports from Health Canada confirm the increase of HIV infections among young people , women , native people and injection drug users .
government ORDERS
Canadians have heard lots of lofty Liberal promises , but the fact is that there are 20,000 more youth unemployed today than this time last year .
that is one of the reasons the House did make some changes which were reflected during the election period .
hon. John Manley :
i think there is legitimate concern among the religious constituencies not just in Quebec but outside Quebec as to how we deal with these issues .
Mr. Speaker , to a person who is just an ordinary citizen , not particularly interested in politics , who turns on the TV to find our colleague across the way on the screen , praising the youth program being developed by the Minister of Human Resources Development , as I heard him doing - the minister seems to be confirming my words - that it is important for people to understand that the youth programs , the Human Resources Development programs , must reflect youth problems as much as possible .
finally Judge Reilly demanded that something be done to look into the societal conditions that were bringing so many people into his court room .
when it was introduced , my understanding is that the government consulted widely with New Zealand to learn better from the mistakes of that country particularly in terms of the rate , how the rate was set , what kind of coverage the GST had and what kind of exemptions were made .
i also believe that when we look at this bill we have done extreme consultation across the west .
i hear some noise back there but I assume he does want to hear this information .
the transitional jobs fund lets people in the riding know what is happening .
i would like to say how proud I am to be the first sovereignist member elected in the new riding of Saint - Eustache - Sainte - Th 茅 r 猫 se .
Mr. Julian Reed
national FAMILY WEEK
it should be noted that France and Canada are signatories to this agreement .
bill C - 53 extended temporary absence provisions and Bill C - 37 actually reduced the parole ineligibility for young offenders convicted of second degree murder in adult court .
the investigation is under way .
the hon. member should be aware that Mr. Levy agreed to the request of the Minister of Foreign Affairs that further discussions take place to ensure that this does not happen again .
the young men and women in the Chamber who serve Canadians so well as pages are the ones who will be the most affected by these decisions .
SchoolNet is another good example .
however , there is a way to fully fund those benefits while at the same time giving younger Canadians better pensions and better retirement security .
our only regret today as we take up our rightful places in this Chamber is that Stanley Knowles is not looking over at us from his place at the centre of the table in this Chamber .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
in fact the very reason we are making changes now is to ensure that it is there in the future .
however , the document continues , and I quote :
this is nothing but demagoguery , the kind of deceit that hurts the most disadvantaged and the workers who foot the bill .
some hon. members :
that accord called for Quebec and Ontario to give up 18 of their senators so that each province would end up with six senators .
the people of Atlantic Canada are suffering from a crisis which for the most part was imposed by mismanagement by successive federal governments .
just this morning she revealed that the health protection branch prematurely approved the migraine drug Imitrex over the concerns of its scientists .
Mr. Speaker , given the openness displayed by the government , I have a supplementary for the minister .
she cannot buy patriotism .
the Canadian people gave us that mandate and so I am pleased to be part of the government .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
perhaps someone on the government side can pinpoint the inconsistency .
optimism is no longer the exception but the rule , since we now have regained the ability to address the priorities of Canadians fairly and equitably .
at the same time there are problems in society that have to be fixed and we will do it in a responsible way .
so now we shall see how things go today .
legislation to implement the 1995 straddling convention died on the order paper when the House was dissolved for the election .
the third theme is investing in innovation and knowledge .
Mr. Fraser presided as Clerk over some revolutionary developments in this House : the creation of the parliamentary interns group , the reorganization of the role of pages in the House and most important , the introduction of this Chamber to all Canadians through live television broadcasts .
in their meeting last week , nine Premiers and the two territorial leaders reiterated their desire for closer co - operation with the federal government in the areas of health care and social policy .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member has taken the facts wrongly and then he has misinterpreted them .
some hon. members :
i have three questions to ask .
it is looked upon as a very important part of that great income security system that the Liberal Party and Liberal governments have made for this country over the past several generations .
madam Speaker , I congratulate you on your appointment .
PRINCESS DIANA
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) :
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :

Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
we are a party that wants to keep this country together .
the two of them were friends and colleagues .
points OF ORDER
Mr. Bernard Patry
it called for a diminishing of rights in education .
i would like the solicitor general to answer my constituents .
Mr. Speaker , this is the same -
perhaps the greatest process of consultation in a democratic nation is putting a platform before the electorate .
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) :
she has the same concern with agriculture as I have about fish .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
the third historic misunderstanding , and again it originates with the members across the way , is to have thought that , in order to make amends for the historic affront of the 1982 patriation , they could toss any little scrap our way after the failure of the Meech Lake accord and we would go for it , in order to put the problem behind us once and for all , with no regard for our pride or our wish to build a strong Quebec .
however , the reason we are supporting this bill is that a majority of directors , 10 of them , will be elected by the farmers who use the CWB ' s services .
immigration ACT
as the throne speech stated , we will continue to be vigilant and responsible about keeping the financial affairs of the country in order .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te
Mr. Speaker , the difference is that during Mr. Mulroney ' s time he moved the deficit up to $ 42 billion .
it would also mean more teachers and student services .
fundraisers would not be allowed to twist the arms of company CEOs in order to get $ 10,000 , $ 20,000 or $ 100,000 in exchange for certain recompenses from the government .
Mr. Speaker , there is of course no connection .
madam Speaker , I rose on the point of order earlier because as a backbencher I and most hon. members are here to hopefully earn back respect for the role and position of members of Parliament .
but will these resolutions make any difference ?
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
thanks to public pensions Canada has made tremendous gains in overcoming poverty among senior citizens and has provided much better prospects for retirement with dignity .
i am really not sure that the prime minister received the message .
let me make a preliminary application of the test of the Canadian national interest to this amendment .
that is not true .
it is a major engine of economic growth , one we intend to promote .
it enshrines the democratic process that outlines the authority those duly elected members will have in the management of the new wheat board .
as I say , there are six million of them out there .
presence IN THE GALLERY
we also know , for instance , that the money in plan was lent to the provinces at rates the same as 20 year bonds .
that is the responsible way to go about looking after the health of Canadians .
he answered the part concerning the RCMP .

hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
the Bloc may very well idolize the Quebec legislation , it remains that it does not prevent minor and serious violations , like the ones committed by Marie Malavoy , a former PQ MNA who contributed to party coffers although she was prohibited from doing so by the legislation because she had not yet become a Canadian citizen .
( members were issued ballots and marked their ballots in secret at voting stations )
from the bottom of my heart , congratulations to you .
Mr. Speaker , I too have worked with the member on a number of occasions and I can confirm that he is highly intelligent .

it is great not to be a rookie .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
Mr. Roy Bailey
section 227 of the Criminal Code now states that no person can be convicted of a homicide if the death occurs more than a year and day from the time of the offence .
the absence of a declaration of intent , precisely what is the intent of parliament in passing such a bill if it does so , concerns me for two reasons .
first , how much should it cost ?
the FAMILY
in setting a path toward a more humane and more just society , he is adhering to the most profound and the most permanent Liberal values .
the Reform Party is not interested in that because it is a very positive thing .

Presto , the jobs are reincarnated only with lower wages , no security and twice the workload .
i may recall that we spent some time discussing drug licensing .

there is hope and optimism for the industries and for my constituents in Etobicoke - Lakeshore .

it is acknowledged that the information sought was not requested under the Access to Information Act .
today in Canada there are approximately five million Canadians who in one way or another are receiving payments from the Canada pension plan .

Mr. Svend J . Robinson

i can say that Canada is one of the leaders on the international scene for its success in preventing these people from getting access to the system that confers refugee status , and in deporting them .
this index could change , because some of the criteria are being reviewed .
Mr. Speaker , the member has a hard time with chronology .
it is important to recognize the foundations which were laid for Canada and Canadians by those who have sat in this House throughout the last century , those who have shaped Canada ' s identity from coast to coast and abroad .
our safety is very much a result of their bravery .
yea .

when we came to power in 1993 we inherited a mismanaged plan from the Conservative government of the day .
it is a very important part of the puzzle that is unemployment .
during the course of my years of professional activity in teaching , the union movement , the environment , in consulting and in international co - operation , I learned that as Canadians we have many more similarities than differences , whether we are teachers , or engineers or unemployed , young and old .
Bryan Williams , a lawyer in the Vancouver area , a long time Liberal supporter , was named chief justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia last month .
the people of Canada elected a Liberal government this time because they believed that we would attempt to change the pension plan -
the chief actuary in this plan requires a 25 year schedule of rates which employees will pay .
speaking of expenses , I sent a letter to the hon. member for T 茅 miscamingue and I also sent La Fronti 猫 re , a newspaper , an open letter listing all of my expenses , even those incurred by my wife , including $ 5,851.18 for moving our furniture from our private home in Ottawa to Abitibi .
he knows very well that most of us , except for one , ran on a platform associated with a party .

as a result of those hearings we made more than 20 amendments to the bill before we reported it back to the House in April 1997 .
the Chair has concluded that there is no breach of privilege in this instance and that it is not appropriate for the Speaker to intervene at the present time .
there has been a tremendous interest , not only an awareness , in the scam perpetrated on the public over the last number of years .
will it give them a better chance ?
we will miss him and we will miss having him here with us .
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Scarborough East .
the death benefit will continue to be equal to six months of retirement benefits but up to a maximum of $ 2,500 rather than the current $ 3,580 .

hon. Hedy Fry ( Secretary of State ( Multiculturalism ) ( Status of Women ) , Lib . ) :
i am very disheartened by her tact today .
they provide Canadians with important services and programs from search and rescue to meat inspection to trade promotion .
the answer unfortunately is no .
why are they doing that ?
he wanted me to stop speaking .
i wonder when he says those things whether he actually thinks that Canadians who are listening to us today take him seriously or whether they do not sit in their chairs and ask " what is with these people ?
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) :

would it not be a good idea since he supports jobs in the medical care system to try to bring that money back into Canada in some way , to provide an alternative choice for those people who are already spending $ 2 billion across the border ?
that member supported the exclusion but had grave concerns about the inclusion .
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
it was rumoured that we had not risen often enough in the House , while over not quite eight months I think I had risen more than 70 times , which is quite a bit more than many members across the way .
i would request that the House immediately allocate additional resources so this backlog of Private Members ' Business can be cleared up as quickly as possible .
this government has the power to say to the provinces " we will give you a year to sit down with us and conclude an agreement for interprovincial trade with a dispute settlement mechanism '' .
i differ very strongly on the issues sovereignty and I cannot help but think what it must be like sitting in opposition looking across at a government that has been re - elected with a majority , a considerable accomplishment in this country .
bill Blaikie > Bill Matthews
many Canadians have creative ideas and suggestions for millennium projects .
many of them have no faith in a public pension plan and who could really blame them ?
in its speech , the government says it wants to make it possible for Canadian culture to reach audiences abroad .
encompassing city hall and the Alberta legislature , Edmonton East also has a variety of cultural communities , Ukrainian , Italian , Chinese and others .
i am going to be asking a series of questions to point out how it is doing that .
some members of my generation think it should be renamed the Canada Ponzi plan .
it consumes about 74 percent of the gross domestic product in the country which is almost without parallel among any of our trading partners .
the auditor general raises a serious issue when the report states about Health Canada that the department is not fulfilling its responsibilities to manage in a way which helps First Nations establish programs and services likely to improve their health .
i wish to draw your attention to the speech made by the hon. member , who is an experienced member of this House , and who speaks in English in a certain way and in French in a different way .
the arts and the culture of a people are the expressions of its heart and soul .

from our friends in the Reform Party there was never a question , never a concern , never an expression of interest in what was happening with the unemployed , the homeless or the sick .

section 520 of the Education Act , as amended by section 36 and by the schedule of the Act to amend the Education Act , authorizes schools that so desire to retain their denominational orientation .
as a matter of fact it is fair to point out that thanks to the public pension plan of Canada that the number of seniors living in poverty has decreased over the last number of years and I think it is fair to say thank you to the Canada pension plan , thank you to our pension plans generally .
Mr. Speaker , certainly the world has regions that are separating .

it is an absolute scandalous mistruth .
that is standard and it is not something we are suggesting .
during a private conversation in Montreal in early May , Judge Jerome provided Thompson with the same legal advice , not to submit an affidavit .
he described Canada not as a country led and inspired by government policy but as a young giant shackled and manacled by government policy .

Mr. Jack Ramsay
i know , Madam Speaker , that you and my other colleagues are very much interested in what is behind the question .
therefore , it is no surprise .
as I mentioned , Bill C - 66 as it was known in the last Parliament , died in the Senate .
although historical deference to Parliament is gone , Canadians basically expect three things : they want members of Parliament simply to be honest , to be competent and to have some leadership qualities to inspire .
she is very fortunate to be in such a place .
i call upon all members of the House today to defeat the defeatist motion by the member of the opposition .
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. minister , but this will bring to a close our question period .

Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) :
i expect , therefore , that in the weeks after the Minister of Finance tables his fiscal update to be able to take advantage of another dividend from our successful fiscal management , to announce the deal of another one - time investment in learning and knowledge similar to what we did last year when we created the Canadian Foundation for Innovation but on a bigger scale .

this was a misuse of that money .
i remember a time when storefronts were littered with for lease , power of sale and going out of business signs .
it is about investing in Canadians in ensuring that the future of Canadians is bright .
Canadians every day face the uncertainty of whether or not their country will remain united .
world RURAL WOMEN ' S DAY
Mr. Greg Thompson :
i am not sure that is always recognized in the House .
there had long been speculation that black holes existed , but Dr. Bolton produced the first credible evidence .
once again Canadians anticipate the introduction and passage of much needed legislation .
in other words , I was going 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 and now , instead of going 90 and 100 as I come to the truck , I only go up to 85 , and then 90 and 95 .
this is a bit of a contradiction because he also remarked about the programs to increase literacy in the population .
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to announce today the appointment of Mr. Justice Michel Bastarache , of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal , to the Supreme Court of Canada .
who then would have predicted that our interest rates would fall far below those of the United States , in fact three and three - quarter per cent for the prime rate ?
we point out some of the ridiculous grants that are given not only to special interest groups , arts funding and things that are beyond the pale , but also to business groups .
Mr. Jack Ramsay
it is fair for the member to notice the NDP , going back to its formation in 1961 , has always been ready to acknowledge that dimension of the collective existence of the Quebec people .
new Zealand may be able to do referendums but the population of New Zealand at some three million is the same as taking a referendum in the city of Toronto .
i believe those who pay for the survey must be allowed to see the results of the survey .
i thank the hon. member for his question and that is my answer .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe :
therefore , I would like to say to you , Your Honour , that the Minister of Human Resources Development should be required to table the letter that he referred to and quoted from in question period .
there are a number of other restrictions .
if the member would give me another few hours I could certainly list a variety of measures , especially under the taxation system to deal with precisely that question .
it will be held steady .
the resulting emotional rush bolstered our national confidence and the sport ' s overall image .
i want to keep the right to dissent , which to me is synonymous with freedom , and I am counting on you .
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
i am concerned about this .
Mr. Speaker , is the Minister of Finance telling us he is afraid to put his arguments up against those of Bernard Landry , that he is afraid to have to admit he was wrong and that he owes Quebec $ 2 billion ?
to this end we will bring partners together to create a new community based program to assist higher risk youth , including aboriginal youth , upgrade literacy and basic work skills , create work opportunities and get the help they need from community resources .
can I honestly believe that he would ask 40,000 fishers " Do you want to lose your income for a year ? "
we think that Quebec , like Canada , is an ecosystem and that the provinces and Quebec are capable of establishing their own standards and environmental policies .
now we have even the Conseil du Patronat fran 莽 ais acknowledging that the temporary removal of the threat of referendum in Quebec has permitted a settling of interest rates , with all due respect to Mr. Bouchard .
Mr. Speaker , it is funny he should talk about personal needs .
the Government will also bring forward measures to strengthen networks among Canadians and to increase knowledge of Canada and understanding among Canadians ; these measures will include enhanced exchange programs for young Canadians .
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) :

the $ 6 billion increase in health spending announced by the Liberals is a sham .

Quebec sends $ 28 billion to Ottawa and is not getting its money ' s worth in return .

the section of the Constitution Act 1867 which the Quebec resolution seeks to amend is section 93 .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
first there must be a recommendation to do so from the board of directors .
rather than trying to gag a 25 - year veteran of his department , why does he not fully investigate these allegations today ?

if the Minister of Finance agreed to hold a real debate on the way ahead , looking at future means of putting our fiscal house in order and the ruthless ones he has taken these past four years and plans to keep using during this mandate , I think that would take care of a real concern people have : they want to be told the truth , where we are headed and who will pay .
labour is one of these costs and government can have a negative influence on this by , for example , keeping employment insurance rates higher than are necessary or by jacking up premiums on pension plans to compensate for 30 years of mismanagement .
can the Solicitor General of Canada confirm in this House that an RCMP investigation is currently being conducted in the Montreal area into allegations of conflict of interest and influence peddling relating to the Liberal Party of Canada ' s fund raising practices in Quebec ?

this legislation will enact the joint federal - provincial agreement reached last February .
as such it is indeed deserving of the special attention of the Government of Canada .
but today , because we are seeing that there may possibly be a budget surplus , because of the slashes the Liberal government has made in these programs and because the taxpayers are in the process of getting this government out of the red , now the Liberals are back to their old bad habits .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
these new initiatives will ensure increased accountability and real measurements of quality such that we can restore the confidence of Canadians in their health care system .
the Speaker :
this is an important motion because it goes to the heart of what caused our debt in the first place .
consent was given except for one member of the Bloc who indicated that if I brought the matter up again today when there would have been time to study it overnight then we could revisit that unanimous consent .
and I doubt the constituents from Abitibi are proud to see their representative make such a scene in the House .

Mr. Bob Kilger :
he told us , when pressed on the issue , that he was aware of an as yet unexecuted confidential sealed search warrant for his ministerial office .
the truth is that the government has shown by its actions , not by the rhetoric but by its actions that it does not care .
Mr. John Bryden
Canadians understand that this is a global phenomenon .
we ask :
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) :
what he is finding and what we have found for the last three years is that there are all kinds of ideas out there in the country , with the think tanks , with the business people who have had to rationalize these problems within their companies or they would go under , with younger Canadians who have been thinking about these things because it is their future that is jeopardized .

RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
i suggest the Reform Party would take us back decades when it was not so important that people and communities worked together for the good of all .
i just want to urge the government to pay attention to that simple message and to start to hear what Canadians are saying and acknowledge that perhaps the government does not have all the answers and that it is time to hear some of the answers that come forth from the Canadian public .
i can assure the hon. member that I will do that .
both the Liberal Party and Reform Party solutions are shortsighted and self - defeating .
Mr. Speaker , my supplementary is for the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of Canada .

before doing anything else , Mr. Speaker , may I extend my warmest congratulations to you on your appointment .
i point out to the House that what the Supreme Court of Canada said today in a very important decision was that the justice official in question exercised bad judgment but did not act in bad faith .

Mr. Jay Hill
given the enormous power of the supreme court in setting public policy in Canada and given the fact the court often makes decisions that should be made by the House , will the prime minister agree that the appointment process for supreme court judges should include parliamentary ratification and , if so , will he refer today ' s appointment to the justice committee ?
this is an event of great importance , not only to my riding of Oak Ridges , but also to Canada .

hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
however , given the lack of solid scientific evidence in support of the theory of global warming , it seems a legislated emissions cap is premature especially in light of the fact that many companies have thus far shown compliance with voluntary programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
most important , we want to present constructive alternatives where we see those deficiencies .
if implemented , this initiative would also impose high long term costs on Canadians .
it is unfortunate they would prey on the fears of Canadians , those who have already retired and those approaching retirement , to try to sell a very bad plan of their own .

i do not look to the Canadian taxpayer for money .
Mr. Speaker , first I would like to welcome the hon. leader of the New Democratic Party to the House of Commons .
persons WITH DISABILITIES
this is not a fair deal for Canadians as current recipients will not be affected but future benefits will be lower for Canadians taking into consideration inflation .
it would allow that income to be eligible for RRSPs as well as extend eligibility for Canada pension plan benefits .
we know what also works .
Mr. Chuck Strahl
he should consider the fact that if we take $ 6.8 billion out of the health care system , we will be left with enormous pressures on provincial governments , on other organizations and on families .
the first time we have not had to go to the capital markets to finance the operation of the government in 27 years is not mismanagement .

we know that higher education is the key to getting a good job .
to this day I am approached by people who offer to help out .

this allows the CWB to finance its operations at lower rates of interest , again to the benefit of farmers and the country as a whole .
it is certainly true that three quarters of the NDP caucus are rookies , I among them , at least newcomers to this Chamber .
in particular , the Government will significantly increase the resources allocated to help small and medium - size businesses develop and commercialize new technology .
however that is only the narrow , technical , bureaucratic intent .

whatever my colleague may think , and I will close on this point , the Bloc Quebecois represents 60 per cent of Quebec ridings .
in this mandate we will add the essential building blocks that are already in place .
another example is former Guelph Liberal member of Parliament , Jim Schroder .
the minister said we are doing this because we will have extensive debate in committee .

first of all , each year the Minister of Finance has brought in a budget cutting funding for provincially run social programs by $ 4.5 billion , including a $ 1.3 billion annual reduction in funding to the Government of Quebec for social assistance , postsecondary education and health .
his contribution to Canadian and New Brunswick political life will remain with us for the years to come .
we need an innovative , realistic plan that sets new priorities for government as part of a long - term vision for our future .
it has taken the relentless efforts of the Bloc Quebecois to persuade the Liberals finally to bring in copyright reform .
the second way the federal government can help in restoring the confidence of Canadians in the quality of and access to health care is by encouraging innovation .
before I begin to speak about the present and the future I want to quote a newly elected member of Parliament , speaking in the House for the first time on May 23 , 1963 .
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is quite right to mention the extraordinary work accomplished by hundreds of voluntary agencies throughout Canada .
the Speaker
reform would create jobs to profit the insurance industry and RRSP sellers , but it would not provide a better deal for workers .
as many know , the riding comprises some four - fifths of Manitoba ' s land mass .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
second , there are young Canadians who , after completing their studies , cannot find the work that would enable them to make a full contribution to society .
every time the federal government announces with fanfare plans to get involved in education , to put an education program in place , to meddle in health issues and every other area under Quebec ' s exclusive jurisdiction , that costs money .
they need to be debated here , but the government has closed down that option .
during the four months the prime minister and his Liberal campaign managers knew that their fundraiser was under criminal investigation , which ministers continued to associate with the fundraiser under investigation ?
* * *
that would be responsible .
it is this issue that I would like to address today .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
it has been an honour and a privilege to have served them since 1988 and I look forward to serving them for many more years , working with them as their voice in Ottawa .
motion agreed to
if Canadians experience increases in their incomes , personal income taxes , EI and CPP premiums reduce those incomes by two - thirds .
this bill was introduced in the second session of the 35 th Parliament and I hope that members of the House will seriously consider the bill ' s intent and purpose .
Mr. Speaker , there is indeed a vital role for voluntary action on climate change .
the citizens of Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford supported my election to the House of Commons because they strongly endorsed the government ' s track record on reducing the deficit and moving the country into the requisite of fiscal responsibility .
as I stated during my speech a direct link between higher payroll taxes and fewer jobs has been demonstrated again and again and again .
that is why I say that we have a number of concerns we want to see addressed in committee .
Gilles Champagne will sit as a member of the Canada Post board of governors .
Mr. Speaker , I apologize .
that is not right .
a constant process of consultation and co - operation must be restored .
premiums will increase 73 percent over the next six years .
i pledge to you that I will carry out my duties in a spirit of fairness and impartiality .
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) :
if I had more time , but I know you would interrupt me , I would give you a whole list of statements made by the French government in other circumstances involving other parts of the world .
the administration of disability benefits and the changes I have just proposed address concerns that have been raised about the rapidly escalating costs of the disability benefits .
we have a commitment to reintroduce that legislation into the House .
we also understand that Canadians look to the federal government for leadership when it comes to the retirement income systems of Canada .
if this is the way to proceed and the majority of grain producers support his latest retread legislation , why are they not applauding him ?
an important milestone ?
this is why the PC party is calling on the government to reward Canadians for enduring years of high taxes by reducing income taxes immediately .
i suspect that he did this to deflect certain criticism bound to come to the government from the upcoming attorney general ' s report .
this no doubt is what is at the root of the RCMP investigation .
they do not believe their own rhetoric .
Mr. Speaker , the amount of the settlement was decided by former Chief Justice Gold .
under the government plan we know where the money would go .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
they should be able to reap some of the benefits now that it is under control .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Health .
Quebeckers enjoy health care , unemployment insurance , welfare and all the social safety nets .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
NEWMARKET YOUTH CENTRE
it is an absolutely astronomical figure .
we have a Prime Minister bent on travelling outside the country to increase trade with new countries .
Mr. Speaker , I would also like to table again , in support of the estimates , part I , the government expenditure plan .
it would give them a tremendous retirement nest egg , far greater than what the government is proposing .
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) :
the Canada foundation for innovation will add to the long term economic prosperity for this country .
will it give consumers more confidence to go out and purchase goods and services ?
the justice system should be aware of them and yet it is inadequate , apparently , to stop their cycle of offending while they are still before the courts .
i hope there is sufficient resolve to carry that feeling through into meaningful changes as the business of this House progresses .
i unfortunately do not know which constituency he represents .
in fact it was more precise .
to force compliance by imposing harsh penalties is an extreme and unco - operative approach .
i would argue none .
the throne speech also outlined the government ' s commitment to public safety .
it also showed the CWB provides a low cost marketing service to farmers .
last April , I tabled over 8,600 signatures for the same petition .
this is not acceptable .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew :
recognition of Quebec ' s unique character , language and legal system will not entail any new powers , privileges or rights .
the reason we have it is because there is no national highway program , which we will get into later .
this certainly expresses a great deal of frustration and anger for 37 % of the people to say throw it away and we will go our own way .
the Chair has heard the representations of the hon. member and has made a review of the material submitted in respect of the application .
madam Speaker , what took place on March 5 and 6 is that the RCMP was informed about what was going on and about what had gone on earlier .
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) :
and where are the Reform Party members ?
supply
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the prime minister .
i think it was Disraeli who said something unpleasant is coming when men are anxious to speak the truth .
i wonder what is meant by the new term creative partnerships .
i admire the member for Saint John .
imagine for a moment that that were to happen .
Mr. Speaker , it is axiomatic and very clear that in every budget the government accounts for government spending .
i am very reluctant to interrupt the hon. member in what he is calling his second maiden speech but I think it is time to move on to statements by members .
when will the prime minister get to the bottom of this mess , or is it to the top ?
what is needed is a real solution to ensure that tuition fees no longer exclude students without deep pockets .
there are some , of course , who link this amendment with section 23 ( 1 ) ( a ) .
this is important because at the same time there is a growing proportion of seniors in our population , there will be a shrinking proportion of working Canadians .
will the minister find the additional funds required to make sure that Newfoundlanders have equal and fair access to training and that they will not be left behind ?
moreover , the Canadian government recognizes them as a key resource in drawing up health policies such as Canada ' s Food Guide , which provides guidelines for a healthy diet .
no criteria has been laid down by the government for determining how any of this surplus should be spent , whether on new programs or on the side of taxes and debt reduction .
anyhow , I still intend to restrict my comments to the debate and to the motion before us , at least as much as I can .
we will continue to do so and we will tell the House how we will do it .
since the hon. member for Simcoe - Grey gives me the impression of being very very positive in these , his first days in the House of Commons , what are the concrete proposals he will make to his party caucus , to the Liberal party ?
QUEBEC PREMIER
national FAMILY WEEK
does it not represent us in Ottawa ?
therefore the need for private pension plans is even more relevant .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased the hon. member has seen fit to point out that the programs of my colleague , the Minister of Human Resources Development , have in fact been very successful in dealing with many of the problems of those displaced due to rationalization of the Pacific salmon industry .
there is not one Reform member who represents Ontario nor do they understand .
this government is prepared to say to the Canadian people forget all that , trust it , this time it is going to get it right .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
the Hon. members may now come and vote .
is that agreed ?
it is a land of lakes , mountains and prairies .
i have to come to the Speech from the Throne .
next , considering that the country ' s financial situation has improved , we asked the government to reduce employment insurance premiums .
i am not so sure that the government has done that .
( division 4 )
we are taking the matter very seriously .
Mr. Hec Clouthier :
Mr. Maurice Dumas
Mr. Speaker , I do not have that information .
i heard about the consultation in major cities , but not all cities were affected by the consultation .
they face challenges together and they help one another in times of need .
madam Speaker , I think my friend opposite should come and visit Quebec .
resuming debate .
now we are facing a Liberal solution : throw money at it .
when people feel secure they can more easily turn their attention to the wider concerns of a regional or national scale .
however , because an election was called , which brought us back to power on June 2 , it became impossible to pursue this initiative .
but I would stress that we intend to fully honour our commitment to invest in this strategy to ensure that every possible effort is made in the fight against AIDS in Canada .
my colleagues and I in the New Democratic Party extend our sincere condolences to Mr. MacRae ' s family , especially to his wife Mina Catherine , his daughter Marjory Ann and his two sisters .
i listened with great interest to the member for Calgary - Nose Hill talk about the importance of a consultative framework .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
the petitions call to the attention of parliament the fact that 38 percent of our national highway system is in disrepair .
Mr. Jim Jones :
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) :
i do not think there were many farmers there .
my colleagues and I stand opposed to such a meanspirited attack on young people and on all Canadians who contribute to this fund .
the Financial Post did a poll of Canadian CEOs and average taxpayers in September .
they could learn how to go about taking this country beyond the year 2000 .
and with this money it has saved on the backs of the provinces , the federal government is now going to finance new initiatives in areas of provincial jurisdiction , such as literacy , university and hospital research infrastructures , etc.
surely , the hon. member for Abitibi must have known former member Richard Gris 茅 , who was president of the Conservative caucus in Quebec and who , like several other Conservative ministers and members at the time , must have been implicated in scandals as shameful as the one which the Liberal Party has been covering up for two weeks already .
to my colleague , the hon. member for Bourassa , I say that we are not tearing our shirts .
the Clerk of the House
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) :
agreed .
radar VETERANS REUNION
the official opposition urges the federal government to pay more attention to what premiers and Reformers have said on both equality and on public participation .
perhaps the best thing he could do would be to ask his own members of the Reform Party to take their pensions .
i would love to send this over to my opposition colleagues .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
i would also like to say how pleased I am today to have my mother , Joyce Levy , and my sister Alison Horne with us .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the member ' s comments .
notwithstanding that , I believe that you , Mr. Speaker , claimed the privileges of the House for this Parliament on Tuesday of last week .
Mr. Speaker , a senior Liberal Party official , Luc Desbiens , said that there is absolutely nothing unusual about the RCMP raiding Liberal Party offices .
i welcome the three priorities of the government in this area : to make sure that young people make a successful transition to the world of work ; to make sure that our young people who want to continue to learn have access to education ; and finally to make sure that our young people who have found it difficult to get started in the workplace get a second chance .
the overriding goal is to strengthen and unite the country by joining in the common purpose of keeping Canada as one of the best places in the world in which to live .
it means that we cannot rest on our past laurels .
Mr. Speaker , I suggest that the hon. member across the way , where he was before the election , compare the first Campeau budget tabled when the Parti Quebecois took office in Quebec with the forecast now being made by Mr. Landry .
* * *
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
i want to ask the member to share with this House in his capacity as secretary of state what he feels are the major priorities for himself in that capacity and what he wants to do for the people of Canada .
for example , in light of a disturbing demographic situation we are well aware of provisions that limit access to English schools .
introduction and first reading
here again , nothing came of the contact .
it opposes the Canadian Wheat Board and has called for dual marketing .
the people of Ontario strongly rejected the tax cuts and survival of the fittest option .
i would like to take a moment to pay tribute to the previous member of Parliament for Sault Ste. Marie , Ron Irwin , who is now a special advisor to the prime minister .
there are gaping holes in this speech .
one is the way the Reform Party has brought forth , which is to do so openly .
Mr. Speaker , it is reprehensible and unacceptable that three rapists of a 17 - year old Quebec City girl were sentenced to just two years less a day .
much of the new increased government spending the Liberals are talking about may go back into these regional development programs .
in this report specific mention was made of the fact that there are no sanctions in place against public servants who may be found to have improperly destroyed records .
and what about the Prime Minister ' s statements to the effect that the code of conduct does not apply to the Liberal Party of Canada , but only to the government ?
perhaps I could buy the members a dictionary because they do not seem to have one .
it is a tremendous amount of money .
that is the question I ask myself .
i want to tell the House that we have taken actions to protect the integrity of our passport , the safety of Canadians and to assure all concerned that Canada is not complicit in any way in this incident .
an hon. member :
in response to misinformation that is being supplied across Canada by the official opposition I want to repeat that there is no change in the age of retirement .
Mr. Speaker , it was earlier confirmed that a search warrant was executed at the Liberal Party headquarters in Montreal .
oh , oh .
* * *
in fact we have a quote in our document " Beyond a Balanced Budget " from a speech the finance minister gave to a Federal Reserve board meeting in Kansas City , United States in 1995 .
one wonders whether an election would have been called so early if allegations or revelations had not been made to the RCMP .
i was not advised of an investigation .
you , sir , have the power to change the employment insurance system as it applies to young people .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
the first president of the CMA was Sir Charles Tupper who would later in 1896 serve as Prime Minister of Canada .
that is why I was there and not as a financial adviser .
* * *
they contract it in the spring .
many Canadians have original ideas and suggestions for millennium projects .
does the member have the unanimous consent of the House ?
outside the country , he recognizes the virtues of bilingualism , while in Quebec , he is against it .
change , prosperity , responsibility , flexibility and honesty ; this is the best guarantee of a united Canada where Quebeckers like myself can be proud to be what they are : full - fledged Canadians .
instead of taking action the government stalled .
* * *
society does not move forward unless we all move forward together .
two months later , on June 19 , 1997 , Quebec MNAs again demonstrated their agreement on this matter by unanimously voting in favour of the legislation that will ensure the implementation of linguistic school boards and govern the place and role of confessionality in Quebec ' s school system .
they know what they are buying when they vote Reform .
one election and a few months later , the Bloc Quebecois is still waiting for more information on this tool to modernize research infrastructure .
the government ' s total lack of attention to these significant contributions is indicative of the low priority that this government and past Liberal governments place on the needs of the resource sector .
a Canada - wide warrant for his apprehension was issued yesterday for breaking parole .
the reason is the Conservative leader failed to convince his 15 colleagues from outside Quebec .
in closing , Canada is distinguished from many other country by the way we treat each other , the way we care for each other .
as soon as we cut the contributions we cut the payouts .
they were all found guilty of money laundering and they were all released just a few months after their sentence was handed down , that is after serving only one - third or one - sixth of the sentence .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
this is my duty and I will do so without fear and without favour .
for the benefit of hon. members , a revised alphabetical list of candidates for the next ballot will be placed in each polling station within the next few minutes at which time the voting will commence .
we take from the poor to give to the rich .
the hon. member for Nanaimo - Cowichan .
i am not sure if Your Honour noticed this but I did want to point that out to the Chair .
the international trafficking in illicit drugs with associated money laundering continues to be the highest threat of all .
maybe I had better tone down .
hon. Herb Gray
as many of the members of the House may recall , in 1995 an extensive consultative process was undertaken that involved literally tens of thousands of producers across western Canada .
how about Big Bill ' s furniture and appliance store , $ 176,000 .
we sincerely hope that the Canadian people in the next election will try to seek the type of leadership that will provide Canadians with this type of government .
i am very pleased to participate in this debate .
this situation would be somewhat comparable to a dual market or voluntary marketing through the Canadian Wheat Board .
part of the problem is that reservists are unavailable for training , often due to the demands of their jobs or difficulty in scheduling time off to coincide with the training exercises and courses offered .
Saskatchewan as everybody knows is a landlocked province and good transportation is absolutely essential to move our products to port , to create and retain satisfied customers and to feed a hungry world .
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) :
that is the 21 st century infrastructure .
Mr. Speaker , obviously the minister missed the question .
i am very proud to say my family traces its roots in this community back to the 1820 s and early 1830 s .
Ms. Michelle Dockrill
that is why we take so seriously the amendment coming from Newfoundland .
it contains a number of smaller towns and villages including St. Agatha , New Dundee , Wellesley , Drayton , Clifford , Belwood , Conestogo , Maryhill and Breslau .
for some hon. friends opposite who are expecting to cash out on the great Las Vegas MP pension scam , $ 3,600 is not a lot of money .
it is estimated that Canadians entering the workforce will receive only 57 cents for every dollar taken from them .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz
Mr. Peter Adams
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi ( Bramalea - Gore - Malton , Lib . ) :
it has to do with what I regard to be the responsibilities of the Chair to protect the rights and privileges of members of this House of Commons to engage in adequate debate on matters of national importance .
an hon. member :
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
Ms. Val Meredith :
my father entered politics in Alberta during the depression .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on behalf of the residents of Saanich - Gulf Islands .
we think it is an unfair tax and we will be fighting to have it eliminated .
an hon. member :
Mr. MacRae was a Progressive Conservative member of Parliament from 1957 to 1972 .
the " It ' s the fault of the federal government " tape is playing once again .
Ms. Jocelyne Bujold - Girard
on Wednesday the House will consider a motion by the President of the Privy Council to establish a special joint committee to consider a proposed amendment to the Constitution regarding education in the province of Quebec .
i am sorry but the hon. member ' s time has expired .
i believe that we have failed over the last 40 years in the unity debate because we have used the wrong process .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
NEWFOUNDLAND
again I want to say that good government makes a difference .
they might want to see the section of the Constitution that we are amending .
as MPs we are accountable .
employment Insurance
however , when we consider that there are nearly one million businesses with paid employees in Canada , of which 97 percent have less than 50 workers , and 1.1 million Canadians who describe themselves as self - employed , surely there are a few basic things that can be done to encourage those people .
to the contrary , they have done an extremely exemplary job under the circumstances and deserve to be commended in the highest manner possible .
i was not aware of an investigation .
Mr. Speaker , I too wish to join on behalf of our party in expressing our condolences to Mr. Fraser ' s family .
i look to my own province with the Alberta Heritage Fund which squandered hundreds of millions of dollars on Gainers meat packing and Novatel .
we will continue to consult in the manner that Canadians have come to expect and appreciate from this Liberal government .
a family is made up of individuals with different hopes , different dreams , diverging opinions and conflicting ideas , but they remain united .
the Speaker :
Canadians understood that the tough decision had to be made in the first Liberal mandate in order to get our fiscal house back in order .
the Speaker :
not only did the government not have that on its agenda , but it castigated as traitors to the unity effort those who insisted such questions be dealt with and that such consequences be communicated to the people of Quebec .
Mr. Speaker , when Alberta moved into a surplus position the first thing it did was survey the public in Alberta to find out what it wanted to do .
how does the prime minister justify this action and will he table the letter in this House ?
contributions are made mainly to the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party , especially when they are in power .
they declined to have a debate .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
GFI employs 102 full time people and uses 64 local suppliers .
if they fail in that duty they will expose themselves to legal liability .
bill C - 2 - MOTION FOR TIME ALLOCATION
Mr. Speaker , I take special pleasure today in paying tribute to the Centre des femmes de Laval , which is celebrating 15 years of operation .
Mr. Michel Gauthier
he has begged for political pork , dined diplomats and grovelled for government goodies .
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
will the minister explain to this House the contents and the extent of the discussions on harmonization with provincial governments and the impact they will have on federal environmental responsibilities and jurisdictions ?
accordingly , the Canada pension plan will move from pay as you go financing to fuller funding to build a substantially larger reserve fund .
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron
when he says that we are bringing this up I have to remind him and jog his little memory that this criminal investigation was launched by the Minister of Human Resources Development .
why ?
Mr. Speaker , I am not sure if the hon. member was just making a point .
many people know them as social engineers .
thus each individual would know the value of their assets in the plan at all times .
at some point we have to trust elected officials .
house OF COMMONS
* * *
i would like to conclude with a quote .
given that 37 percent of all federal contracts , totalling $ 3.2 billion in 1995 , were untendered , does the minister not recognize that this approach opens the door to all sorts of abuse , including strong possibilities of influence peddling ?
enhance research and dissemination of health information focussed on the needs of Aboriginal people through a new Aboriginal Health Institute .
employment INSURANCE
the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency raised costs of producers , slowed private investment and kept unemployment high .
these characteristics were essential to the settlement , development and enrichment of this great country .
prayers
we want these issues on the floor of the House of Commons to be transparent .
this is great for votes , it is very laudable and sounds very interesting .
bravo Minnijean Brown Trickey , a proud Canadian .
it is difficult to be absolutely certain young people who found it difficult getting started in the workplace have a second chance when necessary .
they have placed a trust in me and it is one that I do not take lightly .
the reality of the matter , however , is quite something else .
the provinces , whose responsibility it is to administer emission reductions , are not on side .
i listened carefully and found it a little meandering .
Mr. Speaker , I acknowledge and appreciate your customary wisdom .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
it is worth pointing out that Quebec wheat purchasers , that is the mills and the bakeries , have appreciated the consistent quality of the products delivered under the auspices of the Canadian Wheat Board , and they hope those same quality standards will be maintained in future under Bill C - 4 .
as the Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs mentioned , it is a proposal that has been endorsed by the Catholic committee for the superior council of education , the federation of school boards , the federation of parents committees and teachers associations representing all the teachers of the province .
employment INSURANCE
he was asked to explain to members why the Minister of Finance is continuing to insist on burdening those who create jobs with unreasonably high EI premiums .
this is not good enough .
if the party financing system is so effective in Quebec , why did the Bloc Quebecois change the amount that can be donated to make it higher ?
he talks about the link that I was trying to make between bringing back respect to the office and this idea of fundraising and linking partisan party activities .
on April 19 , 1995 -
we have seen unemployment ratchet up and up and up and up .
instead of just two years of reserve , there will be up to five years .
during the spring campaign and throughout the summer months the constituents of Erie - Lincoln delivered a very clear message that something must be done about unemployment .
the responsibility of a critic is not just to jump to their feet every time the government stands , or rather sits ; the responsibility of a critic , number one , is to be positive and , number two , to look for defects in what the government is saying .
the Speaker :
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
in fact today we have five workers for every pensioner .
* * *
they put themselves on a pedestal above taxpayers who pay the CPP , just like the leader of the fifth party who is looking forward to a pension of more than $ 4.2 million , just like the Minister of Justice who is looking forward to more than $ 1.5 million .
one of the great icons of Canadian political history and it certainly endeared myself to him to know that he was also one of the great icons of the Liberal Party , the late Paul Martin Sr . , was part and parcel of the genesis of this wonderful bill .
the government is now about 40 percent of the size it was in 1983 .
this would go a long way toward eliminating poverty for elderly widows , for example .
an hon. member :
i insist on the word " public '' .
- environment , Votes 1 , 5 , 10 and 15
the Speaker :
the Prime Minister ' s conduct in introducing government legislation in the Senate is offensive to the dignity of this elected House , disrespectful to all of its members and is a contempt of this House .
i will once again quote Mr. Scraire :
to do this beginning this year we will start accelerating the pace of contribution rate increases beyond what is currently legislated so that people begin to cover the cost of their own benefits and stop passing increasing shortfalls on to the next generation .
canada PENSION PLAN
he drives very , very slowly .
can the minister inform us as to whether these projects have been approved since then ?
routine PROCEEDINGS
is she prepared to act on the commission ' s recommendations ?
it is beyond me and the constituents of Scarborough Centre .
i realize that Canadians have done a great deal to help the federal government put its financial house in order and strengthen the social and political fabric of Canada .
on September 1 of this year , he passed away , leaving us all saddened .
i must denounce the disciplinary measures taken by the management of the Providence home in Shediac against two employees who tried to pressure the federal and provincial ministers into putting more money in health care so that they could properly care for our seniors .
i salute the citizens of Calgary and Alberta .
just scrap it and replace the CPP with super RRSPs .
the grass is growing and buffalo are grazing where they have not grazed for 300 years .
in other words we are being asked to amend the Canadian Constitution in compliance with a section of the Constitution that the Quebec assembly does not recognize .
it is not surprising therefore that the former environment minister tacitly admitted before the UN Commission on Sustainable Development last April that Canada was falling short in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
that is why most private members in the House are upset with this whole situation .
the premium payments will not go into the government ' s general revenue .
does the hon. member for Calgary - Nose Hill agree that the millionaires pay more than their fair share in taxes ?
there are about six million Canadian passports out at any given time .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to table , in both official languages , a number of order in council appointments which were made by the government .
that in itself should be clear evidence to the members opposite .
that is the point I was making .
Jefferson said " I can think of no safer depository for the ultimate powers of society than in the people themselves '' .
i implore the government to sit down and look at the whole issue .
the only way the people can speak is through their elected representatives in the House , through the polls , letters to the editor , through petitions to this place , letters and phone calls to ministers of cabinet .
we should certainly be glad that all stakeholders were able to achieve a consensus but , in accordance with parliamentary custom , we have to provide an opportunity for these stakeholders and others to be heard on such an important constitutional amendment .
first you start with $ 2 million .
the government proposes little with respect to the economy .
more profits mean more growth and more growth means more jobs .
to all hon. members I would like to extend congratulations on elections and re - elections .
such practices should never be condoned in our society .
however , I have also indicated that if there are ways in which I can develop a broader consultation process to receive the views of those interested in supreme court appointments , there may well be merit in that and I would be willing to consider the possibility .
this business started years ago .
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea .
organizations like ACTEW and Skills for Change in my riding embody the vision and values and have the expertise to help realize the potential of those highly motivated Canadians who would truly rather be working .
that is what is happening to wheat board grains .
now we have the irony of the member for St. John ' s East telling us that he again is not listening to the people in his riding when it comes to the amendments to term 17 .
we had to bring some of the amendments in at report stage .
multiculturalism
he should know that he must show respect to this institution and to all parliamentarians .
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) :
is that agreed ?
either you ' re in or you ' re out .
i take this opportunity to pay my respects to my Bloc Quebecois predecessor , Laurent Lavigne , to whom I wish a well deserved rest before another referendum on Quebec ' s political future is called and he is again called upon to help build a country , a plan that he must not have lost sight of in his retreat in Saint - Stanislas - de - Kostka .
those were their own words .
as I recall , part of the time you were criticising my portfolio , but always in a very positive and constructive way .
obviously , a better way would be to take that $ 3,300 and invest it in almost any kind of securities or program if it was compulsory .
some hon. members :
Mr. Speaker , my question is now for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
at the moment we are actively involved in efforts to eradicate polio in West Africa and we are examining a variety of possible next steps to see how we can best use our resources to help immunize the world ' s children .
i was pleased to hear in the Speech from the Throne that the government is committed to working with provincial and territorial governments to develop a broader agenda for children including clear outcomes in measuring their success .
a great deal of victims legislation will have to be co - ordinated with those provinces , which have the task of administering our criminal law .
hon. John Manley
now everywhere Canadians together are making choices for a new millennium .
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the new Leader of the Opposition in this House .
the whole process has been thoroughly public and transparent .
this led to a case which would have taken the government to court and the case was settled out of court .
to illustrate , the seniors benefit will go into effect on January 1 , 2001 .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
as the minister said , on April 15 , 1997 the Quebec legislature voted unanimously in favour of a resolution for a constitutional amendment which would end the application to Quebec of subsections ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) of section 93 of the Constitution Act 1867 .
ALGERIA
while this issue is of special importance to the Jewish -
to do so governments must work better and smarter .
it tries to pretend that the spending is not appropriate .
the average master ' s graduate in science and technological earns $ 45,000 to $ 50,000 in Canada .
by investing in Canada ' s research facilities and government and university laboratories we will maintain one of the best research and development infrastructures in the world .
Mr. Speaker , we appreciate the fact that there are discussions , but our question was when is the prime minister going to ask for a formal apology from the prime minister of Israel .
suspension of Sitting
it is time again for us to join forces around a common ideal .
but that is not equality , that is no good , according to the government .
they are accustomed to a member of Parliament who is accessible , responsive and deeply involved in her community .
breast CANCER
No.
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
it is amazing the satisfaction I am getting today standing in the House seeing the Leader of Opposition very preoccupied with the fact that we have been very successful in what we did with the finances of the nation .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
what we propose , first of all , is to add a fourth pillar to the retirement income system and a better distribution of the burden of retirement income across those four pillars .
from our dairy , poultry , cattle and swine producers in Alliston , Elmvale , Markdale and Stayner to the best apple growers in the world in and around Thornbury and Collingwood , these farms are an integral part of Canada ' s food producing industry and deserve the support and confidence of the federal government .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
i thank my colleagues opposite .
i can assure you that the Bloc Quebecois will pay close attention to this all important consideration for those affected .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabasca , PC ) :
as Mr. Tavanas , the Rector of Universit 茅 Laval in Quebec City , recently pointed out , " because of the globalization of knowledge - based economies , particularly in the developed world , knowledge is finally recognized for what it is , namely a collective wealth , a tool for economic and social progress , and a competitive asset for nations .
if I may be so bold , it is probably an endorsement of myself as the candidate .
the Deputy Speaker :
we have helped classrooms to connect with all libraries and with everyone throughout the country .
here is what he said and I do not think I could say it better .
nay .
need we remind members that the Bloc Quebecois received a cash advance of $ 1.5 million from the Mouvement des caisses populaires Desjardins to launch its 1993 election campaign ?
we will have a CPP that will protect Canadian pensioners in the 21 st century .
Mrs. Francine Lalonde
in Germany , Australia , the United States and in other big federations of the world regional interests are expressed in their federal arenas through an effective upper chamber .
questions and comments , the hon. member for Provencher .
in its Employment Strategy , the Liberal government has put public finances back on a sound footing , starting by addressing the problem of the huge deficits inherited from past governments .
Mr. Speaker , do you know how much you have to earn to be in the top 10 percent of earners in this country ?
hon. Herb Gray
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
he also knows very well that his constituents do not support every single plank of that platform .
he is in a position to know .
we have seen just this past summer things like the section 745 hearings for people like Clifford Olson who is a self - admitted child killer of 11 children .
persons over the age of 65 as of December 31 , 1997 who elect to start CPP retirement pensions after that date will also not see these pensions affected .
we had hoped that we would be able to prevent additional layoffs in the department through cost recovery programs , but our analysis indicated we had to take action now .
however , that is not the worst of it .
Mr. Roy Cullen
for example , what about people who become disabled ?
i would like to consider another aspect of the bill put before us by the minister .
we must look at the causes .
second , is it true , as is alleged , that the Bloc Quebecois might possibly have received funds from financial institutions that are not individuals ?
i will try to deal with each one .
as I have indicated on several occasions , the Government of Canada supports the proposed amendment because it is a good thing for the citizens affected by it and because it enjoys a reasonable degree of support from those citizens .
will the citizens of Quebec and Canada once again be told that , now that it has turned the screws a little tighter , the federal government will again begin to meddle in affairs that do not properly concern it ?
why did the prime minister fail to send representatives to testify at these hearings and to stand up for Canada ' s interests ?
i think members on both sides of the House should be more careful in their choice of words .
i am at variance with that .
hon. Sergio Marchi ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Charles Hubbard ( Miramichi , Lib . ) :
it was detrimental .
before I conclude I will touch on the issue of national unity .
that the following words be added to the address : " and this House regrets that your government is proposing a legislative program that is mired in the past , out of touch with the present , and incapable of leading Canadians with foresight and vigour into the 21 st century '' .
whereas undertakings were given by the federal government to proceed rapidly with such amendment , through bilateral action and with the agreement of the National Assembly ,
is it done with accountability to the people who rely on this plan and want to know that it is there ? "
the third sector is coming on line to help better determine the gaps and duplications and become more accountable .
it is time for it to stop and take a look .
i left my position as general manager in October 1996 and the allegations are supposedly about something that took place on March 6 , 1997 .
in the end the grain industry pays for them .
we will raise the matter there .
as Windsor prospers economically our other problems subside .
this was a case of first degree murder .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to recognize the presence in the gallery of one of Canada ' s most well - known and internationally acclaimed film makers , Mr. Atom Egoyan .
bill C - 5 .
by setting this goal and enlisting the co - operation of the pioneers , those wonderful retired telephone workers who have already refurbished cast - off computers from government and the private sector , today we have placed over 40,000 computers into the classrooms of Canada .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom
for a government today to be talking about a potential surplus and to be fast off the mark suggesting that if we get that real fast it should find a way to spend it , I think it is quite appalling that we are back into that kind of spending mentality .
it is all well and good to excuse rudeness and lack of common courtesy as part of the political game or as part of parliamentary tradition , but when young children watching parliamentary debates ask their parents why those men and women are so angry at each other , why they are being so rude to each other , why they are fighting with each other , then I ask if this is a tradition that is worth keeping ?
at that moment the voting will commence .
years ago one of the dark sides of Canadian history was the head tax on Asians .
the national child benefit represents the best that this type of co - operation has to offer .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
ATLANTIC CANADA
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
breast CANCER
we know there will be a need to seek more input .
they are saying we need to do the same for aboriginal people .
there are no guarantees for any of us .
B.C. is equally unrepresented in this House .
* * *
one of the outstanding characteristics of my riding is the high degree of volunteerism from the community and the willingness of the corporate sector to support both with personnel and funds the initiatives which the community values .
Mr. Speaker , once again we hear innuendoes and accusations from the other side that are not based on fact .
but the evolution of Quebec society with all its characteristics has seen a consensus emerge in both the francophone and the anglophone communities .
pay EQUITY
but I want to say that when someone has sat in the House for two terms of office and worked hard for his constituents , we cannot but express our admiration and note that this was truly someone who put himself out for those he represented .
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Canadians will start to receive regular statements on the pensions they are earning .
Ms. Bonnie Brown
environment
there are , of course , major advantages to streamlining the Canadian Wheat Board ' s operating method and making it more functional .
that is much of the reason for the make - up of the House as it is .
i know the hon. member would want us , before embarking on a national pharmacare program , to look into its design , its funding and its delivery .
Mr. Monte Solberg :
we also know that the best way to carry on his legacy and honour his work is to try to maintain the high standards he set for all of us , the standards of fighting persistently for social justice and always doing it with honesty and integrity .
in fact back when there were a strong set of trade ties with New England when most of Atlantic Canada came into Confederation , it was by far the wealthiest part of the country .
our fifth proposal would increase tax benefits from $ 850 million to $ 2 billion , adding $ 1.15 billion in child tax benefits .
given the revolving door between industry and government and real concerns about conflict of interest , we want to know if Canadians can be assured that the federal government and not the brand name industry is setting drug prices .
a new global economy based on knowledge , technology and innovation is rapidly emerging .
this is the section dealing with provincial jurisdiction over education .
madam Speaker , it is a great pleasure for me to rise in the House today to speak for the first time in the 36 th Parliament and to talk about what is important to this session of Parliament and Canadians .
these are legitimate concerns .
canada , on the other hand , is 130 years old .
Mr. Speaker , while the leader of the official opposition wants to communicate with Quebeckers , poverty is spreading in numerous regions across the country .
furthermore , I wish to remind the House that it is not up to the Chair to comment on the behaviour of public servants in the performance of their duties .
canada ' s young people are the best educated , the most literate and the most technologically adept in our history .
i see examples of this government ' s hypocrisy every day in my riding of Markham .
when I look across to the Liberal benches I see some of his accomplices .
royal CANADIAN LEGION
there are some good points and I want to identify them before I get into some of the concerns which New Democrats have .
we see things differently .
is that agreed ?
Mr. Speaker , it is important that whatever we do with the Canada pension plan is fair to the present beneficiaries of the plan who were promised a pension , who paid in good faith and who now in many cases have done their financial planning on the basis that they would receive the promised benefit .
of course two - thirds of the board are now going to be elected in 1998 .
they are now basically in line with some of the main points we are raising .
not a treaty between typical , unique or distinct societies , or whatever else .
the review will focus on the impact of the end of TAGS program on clients and help the government and our other partners develop forward looking solutions .
Mr. Steve Mahoney :
Mr. Knowles , like his friends and collaborators J . S . Woodsworth and Tommy Douglas who were also Christian ministers in the Methodist and Baptist traditions , was a part of the social gospel movement , a movement that true religion encompassed not only the vertical relationship of individuals to God but also the horizontal dimension of service to one ' s fellow man .
Mr. Speaker , almost two weeks ago the Minister of Health announced a moratorium on cuts to the drug and food research lab and specifically promised to undo the food research reductions that he had ordered in July .
Mr. Speaker , I have listened to the speech of my colleague from the Conservative Party with interest and was unable to detect , in the part I was able to hear , any personal opinion on the matter of the amendment to the amendment by the Bloc Quebecois .
the people of my riding are optimistic again .
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
BRITISH COLUMBIA
we have to recognize from where and why that pressure comes .
first and most important I want to take this opportunity to thank my constituents , the people of St. Catharines , for choosing me to represent them here in the nation ' s capital in the House of Commons once again .
Mr. Dan McTeague ( Pickering - Ajax - Uxbridge , Lib . ) :
in his February 1995 report , the chief actuary clearly showed that without modifications to the Canada pension plan , the CPP fund would be exhausted by 2015 and that contribution rates would have to soar to over 14 percent to cover the rapid growth in cost .
let us take a look at what Britain is going to be doing .
people rallied around him and his national party with the deepest conviction .
aboriginal AFFAIRS
bill C - 1 .
i undertake to do that .
Mr. Speaker , if I may , I will start with a reply to each of the hon. members who have shared their time .
most if not all of us would agree that you are a learned student of this House .
a first step to admit that we want to obtain national unity would be for Canada to issue an apology to the aboriginal people for the manner in which we have historically treated aboriginal people over the years .
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
the bill proposes to establish an investment board to manage the funds transferred to it from the Canada pension plan account .
we are for individual contributions .
they were worried about the future .
here as elsewhere , the government will probably be content to give back some of the funding it cut in the past .
the way Bill C - 4 sets it up there is indemnification and there is no responsibility on behalf of the board members .
i want to talk about other approaches to pensions we have heard about in the House .
how did he win ?
Halifax is often said to be something of a bell - wether riding .
they told us to do this in a way that does not pass on an insupportable cost burden to younger generations .
we are sure that you will fulfil the mandate required of all Speakers .
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT
this is the very least we owe them .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
we urged the federal government to mail a letter containing that declaration to every Quebecker .
Mr. Speaker , as a working carpenter and a tradesman I have long envied the labour relations climate in the province of Quebec , the recognition of workers rights and the health and safety legislation .
labour
the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement does not have as specialized a role as the organizations I just mentioned .
order .
let me assure hon. members the changes contained in Bill C - 2 tackle the problems facing the Canada pension plan .
in Parkdale - High Park just last month the Parkdale Community Watch won the distinguished 1997 International Society of Crime Prevention Practitioners community based program of the year award .
we have increasing numbers of indications that this approach is working .
we are bringing in these fundamental changes so that middle income and low income Canadians can be assured of a decent retirement .
the Bank Act , passed by the House of Commons and supported by the finance committee made up of Liberals , Reform members and former Conservative members , allows banks to do whatever they want .
the Leader of the Opposition , among others , mentioned that , because an amending process is involved , thought should perhaps be given to a referendum to validate the democratic basis .
i am now going to deal with points of order .
the auditor general reveals that 7,500 trucks carrying hazardous waste cross the border between Quebec and the United States alone , without any federal control .
international TRADE
i have in my hands a paper -
that is a very important point .
i recall one interview in which a gentleman from the Saguenay region , with tears in his eyes , said how moved he was by the response from the rest of Canada .
the hon. member opposite has had exactly the same kind of experience .
the fact is we are not sure any more , since these allegations were made .
they recognize it out in the real world and I suggest this government wake up and recognize it not only in the throne speech but in the way it governs this country .
we look forward to working with all our partners , including industry and the province , to address the solution of Atlantic fishers .
the Speaker :
Mr. Speaker , I rise in support of my colleague from Wild Rose .
it is their money .
i declare the subamendment lost .
well we did it .
law ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
if government members talked to their constituents they would discover that people are very concerned about this massive debt .
some writers refer to Canada ' s pay as you go CPP as a Ponzi type scheme .
is it any wonder that two - thirds of British Columbians rejected the accord ?
i therefore believe that it is important , both for the public and for the professional association of dieticians , that they be officially recognized and integrated into the Canada Health Act .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Pat Martin
i also know that the Minister of Health has proceeded with an evaluation of the strategy , and I may recall it consists of five main components .
we want political party financing to be changed so that it is transparent and open ; so that constituency patronage and regional patronage end ; and so that tollgating and other such issues end .
taxation .
i have said it on a number of occasions in this House .
they do not go nearly far enough to address the real concerns being echoed across the prairies by Canada ' s western grain farmers .
there is none of that in this speech from the throne .
Friday , September 26 , 1997
the Speaker :
the member should clarify his remarks .
this was the case with the Austrians and the Hungarians before the 1914 - 18 war .
we have talked to Ron four or five times , almost every day , to find out how things have changed .
we advocated the elimination of the GST on children ' s clothing , which is exempt in most of the provinces now from provincial sales tax , certainly in my province of Saskatchewan .
public consultation is also necessary before this government agrees to import over 100 tonnes of plutonium from Russian and American nuclear warheads to burn as fuel in Candu reactors .
presentation OF MOTIONS
but he first ran for Parliament in 1935 .
the Speaker
like the member for Qu ' Appelle pointed out , members of the Reform Party came into the House in the last session , in the last campaign and now in this session talking about the importance of taking direction from their voters , the importance of listening to their constituents and acting in their best interest .
" the package , fresh start , is infuriatingly vague on identifying specific spending cuts and their timing .
i will not comment on that because I am not part of that process , nor do I represent an aboriginal community per se .
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
but maybe -
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
when he returns to Canada , why does he not get the premiers together and organize a Team Canada trip in Canada ?
with respect to non - governmental organizations , the government has to date , consulted with the Canadian Labour Congress , the Canadian Auto Workers and has been in contact with the World Wildlife Fund .
as a general rule once a decision has been given it should just rest where it is .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
they have participated in town hall meetings on health care , on the environment and on social programs .
it assumes that all investors will make wise investments .
more disturbing was the fact that he did not appear to appreciate that Bayne was misleading him as to the law .
the federal government wants to limit eligibility to those who have contributed to the plan for four of the past six years , which should make the plan considerably less accessible .
it is shameful and I am convinced that his constituents are not proud of the speech their member has just delivered .
farmers will always hold a two to one majority among the directors over all .
Montreal was the hub of the dynamic business region and largest city in Canada up until the 1960 s .
it falls upon me now to take the information you have laid before me on this question of privilege .
hon. Allan Rock
the FAMILY
madam Speaker , I would like to respond to the last comment made by the hon. member .
however , in his speech , he mentioned our government ' s accumulated deficits , and I would like to give him a little background quickly .
i hope that he would modify his approach somewhat over the next few months .
its influence , and Alberta ' s influence , on national affairs through creative policy alternatives and new ideas that flow from the area , is considerable .
therefore this amendment enables a peace officer to arrest the person who is in breach of a condition of parole or release .

that support comes at a price .
this is today ' s Order Paper for the House of Commons .
two successive premiers of Newfoundland have said that people become dependent on unemployment insurance .
will young people also see a decrease in their pension benefits ?
all those in favour of the amendment will please say yea .
APEC '97
it is going to mean working with provinces and others to tackle issues such as waiting lists .
the $ 600,000 program is going toward the creation of jobs and will be paid when the jobs have been created .
in light of the questions that the House heard today on the subject of party fundraising , as a Quebecker , would the minister agree , yes or no , that the federal government should take Quebec ' s lead and pass legislation limiting the funding of political parties to that provided by individuals ?
the courts have now spoken , ruling in the board ' s favour .
how can the minister keep using this excuse when we all know that extensive work is under way at other airports , including the one in Vancouver , and that the RCMP has nevertheless been replaced by municipal police forces everywhere except in Quebec ?
while in theory it too is a national party , or claims to be a national party , in fact in the House it is an Ontario party with a Quebec contingent .
technically , obstructing members in the discharge of their responsibilities to the House or in their participation in its proceedings is considered to be a contempt of the House .
Mr. Alex Shepherd :
children need a large investment of time and attention for healthy development .
she set an example in how to overcome our difficulties .
they believe that the status quo , our approach and our relationship with aboriginal people is not good enough and it must change .
Mr. Carmen Provenzano ( Sault Ste. Marie , Lib . ) :
i would like to encourage the government to adopt them as useful tests .
it prescribes a minimum and a maximum sentence in terms of a fine , a jail term or restitution to the victim .

it is time you took care of real problems and -
i learned that among Canadians there is an important desire to work together in a shared political framework .
without a road or an airstrip , site exploration is impossible .
if I recall correctly , I was reprimanded last week for having used the word " steal '' .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
my bill will allow the federal government to use its constitutional responsibility under sections 91 and 121 of the Canadian Constitution to complete sections of the agreement on internal trade .
but this government can take some leadership , show some vision and help the farmers not only in my riding but across the nation to achieve their goals , and it is not doing it .
as I said yesterday , I can confirm in the House that , having made my decision and informed the RCMP , I wrote my March 5 letter to Philip Murray , in which I told him :
Mr. Brent St. Denis
i represent the wonderful riding of Beauce .
will I have to pay him for the time he spends in prison ?
i simply want to ask the Prime Minister whether he knows how the other provinces will consult their citizens on the Calgary declaration .
we must not be afraid to reach out to our Quebec neighbours , and that is exactly what ComDev is doing .
we also know , based on a recent poll published in the weekend Financial Post , that Canadians want tax relief .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration .
is the President of the Treasury Board saying that he will not send a representative to the bargaining table and that he intends to use all the legal stalling tactics at his disposal to delay a settlement ?
sixty per cent of these relationships involve children .
i only hope that I am part of a parliament that will begin to reshape Canada and that I may in some modest capacity be a part on that process .
we have to anticipate .
i ask that he -
this is what has happened many times .
i frankly take exception to a member of the House standing in his place and saying that because we are Liberals in the government we do not care about people .
Ms. Karen Redman
you can ' t possibly do that .
it is not a situation I would ever want to find my family in and yet there are thousands of families across the country that are being affected that way .
Ms. Alexa McDonough
with the cutbacks to health care budgets from the federal government to the provinces , more and more aging people are receiving inadequate home care .
Quebec farmers are no exception to the rule and want to see their colleagues in the west benefit from this new arrangement of the Canadian Wheat Board .
as the member well knows , there are two airports in Montreal , and international flights have just been transferred .
what the member is asking me to do is outside the purview of the Speaker .
the Canadian Wheat Board will now be more representative of those needs .
however I was wondering , instead of having you begin and then interrupting your remarks for question period , if you would begin your remarks when the debate reconvenes .
i know Michel Rioux of that company quite well .
investing in Quality Care and Good Health
Mr. Jack Ramsay
i think that is what separates us from the opposition , the Reform Party .
Mr. Murray Calder ( Dufferin - Peel - Wellington - Grey , Lib . ) :
are those the programs he wants eliminated , rejected and put aside ?
yet we hear the member going on and on about the wonderful things his government has done for aboriginal people .
Mr. Gilles Bernier
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien :
in addition we have our share of concerns and problems .
i look to the Nisga ' a agreement and the strategies that are in place there to build a strong relationship between the people of that First Nation and this country Canada .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
will the Prime Minister give his word today that fishing families and others reeling from excessive and brutal Liberal cuts to Atlantic Canada will not continue to get short shrift ?
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
down the throats of you and me .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
i understand the hon. member is a physician .
Mr. Speaker , I want to do just that , which is why I am furious that this government is trying to gag Parliament on this issue .
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
i am pleased to be here today , Madam Speaker , and to wish you good luck .
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) :
my friend in the Reform Party referenced the fact that the NDP members themselves have been tainted by bingo - gate and raising money that was supposed to be going to charitable organizations .
on your behalf , I made the usual claim for your privileges which His Excellency was pleased to confirm to you .
hon. Sergio Marchi ( Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have a petition signed by a good number of constituents in the Wetaskiwin riding who are concerned with the sustainability of the Canada Pension Plan .
those who crafted section 745 and those who support it should hang their heads in shame .
although I realize that so many numbers are difficult to follow they must be in the parliamentary record in fairness to future generations .
children
some of the answers are contained in what is and is not in the throne speech of last Tuesday .
i also marvel at the member ' s skills in terms of making speeches .
the hon. member asks a question about unique character and distinct society .
this is a unique Parliament standing on the threshold of a new era .
in the final analysis it is demand that determines price .
i noted with some sadness that yesterday we heard of our first vacancy of the 36 th Parliament created by the resignation of my colleague , Sharon Hayes , the past member for Port Moody - Coquitlam .
this officer reports that when the minister ' s staff members were supposed to be searching aeroplanes at Toronto ' s Pearson airport they were actually pulled away from their jobs to expedite FedEx shipments .
another provision of Bill C - 4 would allow for cash purchasing .
there is a third group of young Canadians whose prospect of finding work in today ' s labour market has deteriorated dramatically .
this son of DIP took about $ 150 million of the money that had been allocated under DIPP , so the original purpose of TPC could not be met on those grounds alone .
they voted for new and better support for the disabled and they voted for increasing support for charitable giving .
the throne speech said that we would continue to be the government of fiscal responsibility .
the amount of the pension will continue to be dependent on how much and for how long a person contributes to the plan .
i sit beside you and we have a good working relationship .
the first is a legal reason .
it is of concern to my department that citizens in those areas that are prone to severe weather events have timely and accurate weather forecasting information .
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
to contribute , the Government of Canada is committed to respond to the Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples as soon as possible .
Mr. Gilles Bernier
appointment of Assistant Deputy Chairman
to those who want to undermine the ability of the wheat board , let me quote what our competitors are saying in the U.S.
if I had the time and the genius of a playwright like Arthur Miller I would write a play about this incredible scenario .
the NDP candidate was regularly sandbagging on teams deployed from the office .
it is not the way to do it .
the dimensions of this rip - off , however , are not well known .
the Speaker :
i have spoken in his riding several times , supporting the Reform candidate there .
on August 31 the world lost a beautiful soul in the death of Princess Diana .
hon. David Kilgour
this is essential to the success of that agenda .
the government is in a different position than members of the opposition , a distinctly different position in the fact that it has direct control over where government funding is directed .
Mr. Speaker , when the allegation was made that somebody was asking people for money , the minister did not wait one day .
as members we have all been entrusted with an important responsibility , that of giving political leadership to Canada as we move into challenging times .
madam Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to notice , I move that the Standing Orders be amended as follows :
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
i want some of the hon. members opposite who are under the age of 30 , mere pups , to take advantage of the wonderful system we are putting in place .
Quebec may not be unique with respect to financing .
multiculturalism
i am truly sorry for that .
this man is back on the streets of Canada , a danger to young people .
it spent extravagantly too .
the first is faith in the individual , which implies freedom of the individual to make his or her own decisions within the constraints of a democratic society .
we have six minutes remaining for questions and comments .
from coast to coast , our country embraces many regions , each different in its own way , including the very unique province of Quebec .
we are not talking about illegal immigrants , but about refugee claimants .
the second bill that will come before the House very shortly will be on seniors benefits .
tenacity and perseverance will be needed .
the aboriginal peoples are made up of several peoples .
* * *
these people are crawling backwards across the Plains of Abraham .
however the chief actuary of the CPP indicated that without these changes the CPP fund would be depleted by the year 2015 and contribution rates would have to increase to 14.2 % by the year 2030 to cover escalating costs .
the Alberta government even mounted a constitutional challenge to the board ' s right to buy and sell grain on behalf of farmers .
Mr. Denis Coderre
hon. Paul Martin
it treats them in a fair and equitable manner .
she enjoys the respect and admiration of people across the national capital region and across the country .
one of the objectives of this bill is to have the board see to it that the amounts collected in the form of premiums are invested in a such a way as to produce the best possible return to ultimately make the retirement fund grow .
Mr. Pat Martin
even if were dense , I surely would have remembered the government selling this high priority Canada pension plan tax hike during the election campaign .
this throne speech goes on to state :
none of these are mutually exclusive .
Mr. Speaker , what does the Reform Party have against successful Canadian companies ?
in his letter of March 5 , 1997 , the Minister of Human Resources Development informs us that at least six projects were in the analysis phase with a view to ministerial approval under the transition job fund .
i think the people in this country , as this debate goes along , are going to start really wanting to know what is happening with the Canada pension plan .
could he tell us ?
the petitioners would like to see the establishment of a national snowmobile safe association that would deal with the issues of licences , registration , insurance , driving age , speed limits and regulations pertaining to the design of snowmobiles .
i know it is of great concern to him and thousands of other people in the west end of Toronto .
Mr. Speaker , I endorse , with great pride , what my hon. colleague just said .
i am going to try to be very quick because I know the member for Broadview - Greenwood would also like to ask a question .
it is in the nature of our society and the reason we are envied throughout the world , it is in our nature to be compassionate to one another .
last , the public sees the government attempting to shore up the Canada pension plan , not by pension reform that better distributes the burden of retirement income across these three pillars but by the simple expedient of a massive increase in CPP premiums .
if that does not stop then Canadians are doomed .
they like to talk , talk , talk , but no action .
we have recalled our ambassador from Israel , and that is the most serious step in international law and diplomacy short of breaking off diplomatic relations altogether .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien
we recognize the need for an education that is responsive to these challenges by committing an endowment fund for scholarship .
what it promised are 29 new spending proposals from the government .
i hope hon. members opposite listen to this example .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) :
i approached Bill C - 2 from the following perspective .
people are imprisoned because they do not respect the law .
maybe he does not know what ordinary people are like .
i salute the pioneers who built these institutions .
i will stick to facts because we cannot get into hypothetical situations .
the minister has revealed that a year ago she set up an organized crime unit in immigration which , as she has said , has thousands of names on file , has a well staffed operation and has good international contacts .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
i presented it to the House during the last Parliament .
a board entirely appointed through cabinet appointments , just like those very noteworthy appointments to the appeals board , to the parole board , to the immigration refugee board -
there is one thing of which members opposite ought to be cognizant .
Mr. Ren 茅 Canuel
* * *
it had no idea about the actual number of jobs created .
i am also delighted , I confess with a particular bias , to see the NDP back in some number .
hon. Andy Scott
i will permit a second question .
can the Prime Minister tell us today whether he shares his minister ' s opinion , and are we to understand from this remark that the federal government would also respect a democratic vote by the Quebec people in favour of sovereignty ?
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
it was already public news on December 12 , 1996 , when the Globe and Mail published an article on it , on page A 16 for those who want to go back and read it .
under the new law for the first time in history , the CWB will be run by a duly constituted board of directors .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
Brian Mulroney damaged the national unity effort by his arrogance .
in that regard it is important to note that students who profess the Protestant faith today account for less than 40 percent of the school population served by Protestant school boards .
Mr. John McKay
does everyone understand the impact a rainy summer on the Atlantic region when the tourists do not come ?
we have a real problem with that , even if the minister and prime minister do not happen to have a problem with that .
however the argument does not follow that somehow the economy will be stimulated and jobs will be created .
people become so obsessed by hating government that they forget it is meant to be their government and is the only powerful public force they have purchase on .
i think it was called " Smoking in the Boys Room '' .
if money could solve the problems facing native Canadians , it would have done so long , long ago .
members have asked me to rule on a specific question of privilege .
we also have members from the Western Canada Concept Party who are now members of the Reform Party that do the same sorts of things .
( official Version )
Mr. Speaker , I want to reassure the member for Waterloo - Wellington , who is already beginning to make his mark in the House with very poignant and very incisive interventions , that as far as the federal government is concerned , in Canada childhood is for children .
now it is very possible that it will spend all its surpluses before we even get to a surplus point .
no effective barrier can be erected to separate oneself from its impact , not on a personal level , not provincially and most certainly not nationally .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
opening OF SESSION
the Deputy Speaker :
we have actually tried to lead the coalition and consensus of the provinces to bring down the barriers and ultimately make those companies better prepared and more competitive to face the world .
all his family and his friends in Fredericton have our condolences .
business people -
in fact , we are a party to the World Trade Organization ' s recent agreement on telecommunications .
it is appropriate that the day chosen to celebrate this day is one day before world food day as women in rural areas around the world make an invaluable contribution to the production of food and the management of other natural resources .
however , that does not detract from the fact that we have one common goal , which is to represent our constituents as best we can .
one further minute to expound upon the great magnanimous qualities of Bill C - 2 .
before recognizing the next hon. member , for the benefit of hon. members who are new to the House , including those who are new to the Chair , I would like to explain the use of the word you .
he talked about replenished resources in the mining industry and offering them to the lowest bidder , at any environmental cost , for the sake of creating jobs and profits .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
the House of Commons covers their costs if they have legal problems with regard to whatever happens in the House .
that is very unfortunate from my viewpoint because I believe those ladies and gentlemen who dedicate themselves to work on the wheat board , those ladies and gentlemen who shall run for the new wheat board , will do a great service for the farmers in western Canada and for all the farmers in Canada .
utilizing the capacity of our modern economy and the diversity and strength of our citizens , the entire world must be Canada ' s market .
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) :
when we compare our system with those in the United States , France or Great Britain -
Mr. Jacques Saada
these are people who would like to abolish altogether the Canada pension plan and replace it with sort of a super RRSP plan which would be a defined contribution plan .
the hon. member for Scarborough Centre now has the floor .
i was certainly less than encouraged by the brevity of the mention of greenhouse gas emissions in the Speech from the Throne .
i do not know whether he actually thinks that Canadians believe him .
i know question period is very quick and sometimes we use words which are not parliamentary .
if he does , why does he not tell us ?
the $ 31 billion Canadian oil and gas industry has not been invited to the environment conference as part of the official delegation in Kyoto , Japan .
there is another point and it has to do directly with the individual tax level , the brain drain .
these programs provide opportunities for youth and people who need to find work and build careers in the new economy .
hon. Sergio Marchi
i quote from the members own reply to the Speech from the Throne when he said " I am very glad to be a member of a party which has a leader of the calibre of the prime minister '' .
we came to Canada in 1956 .
are they in the House saying that barley should be marketed through the Canadian Wheat Board ?
minister OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased today to be able to speak to Bill C - 4 , the amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board .
i think that speaks volumes about the integrity of that party .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis
the anonymity provisions of the Young Offenders Act precluded neighbours from knowing the threat he posed .
the deputy minister did not act in order to protect government integrity .
would the hon. member be kind enough to rephrase the question ?
i am sure the Reform Party would not understand that because it wants to abolish the Canada pension plan and replace it with a totally private plan that will benefit the wealthy people and say to hell with the ordinary people in this country .
there would be no fudging , no hedging , just the bottom line .
it was interesting to hear the sound bite this morning on the news of the leader of what I believe is the fifth party in this beautiful establishment , the leader of the Progressive Conservatives , who said that there was a sign over the Prime Minister ' s door which reads " send it and we will spend it '' .
as soon as it started to get back to the period before that , the government stonewalled the inquiry .
historically , because of the wheat board ' s strong performance , the federal guarantees have been called on in only rare and isolated circumstances , but the Government of Canada is on the hook if something suddenly goes wrong .
i acknowledge that the Toronto Stock Exchange is at historic levels .
this is not a problem which is absolutely new to the House .
we need to find those answers .
Mr. Speaker , I would just like to ask the member this one question again .
i apologize , Mr. Speaker , but my question is for the Prime Minister and concerns his compliance with the government ' s code of conduct .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
i think that Mr. L 茅 vesque was right .
it would stimulate the economy and give Canadians the much needed tax relief they deserve .
there is much to do in amending our laws in this country , including the Young Offenders Act , in order to regain the confidence of Canadians and place back into their hands the authority and responsibility to raise their own children in a manner they think is in the best interests of themselves , their children , their communities and this country .
MANITOBA FLOOD
as my colleague before me pointed out , it is very clear when they talk about not having protection for the farmers who are sitting on the board from legal suits that may come about .
prayers
Mr. Jason Kenney
Canadians are demanding a parole system that is limited , earned and tightly monitored .
together federal and provincial governments must respond through the national child benefit system we are now building .
the trouble with doing something right the first time in over 30 years is that no one really appreciates how difficult it was to get there , but I believe Canadians do appreciate the enormity of the sacrifice to bring the deficit from $ 42 billion in 1993 down to zero in the next fiscal year .
Mr. Yvon Godin :
it is the revealing of it generally that is prohibited under the rules .
Mr. Dick Proctor :
the Bloc is back .
i would like to extend my appreciation to my family who sacrificed a fair amount of time , energy and money to see me re - elected .
maybe that was it , I am not sure .
the people of Saint - Maurice want a government that listens to them and respects them , and that is the kind of government I want to lead .
NIAGARA - ON - THE - LAKE , ONT .
this is an incident that we are all concerned about .
we have to send a message from sea to sea to sea which says we are united , that Quebec is a part of Canada .
Mr. Bill Casey
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
they will scratch their heads and wonder if we have gone crazy .
every home I visited during the federal campaign has somehow been hurt by the cuts to the public sector .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
if he was too sluggish in his first mandate to implement our suggestions , which , I would point out , are currently being used by Canadian universities as a good example of tax reform , he should be delighted and accept the proposals of the Bloc Quebecois .
as my friend from Calgary pointed out earlier in the day , under the Reform Party plan , if the mandatory CPP premiums were put them into an RRSP , and accumulated in an account in the individual Canadian ' s name , at the end of the 40 years they would have an annuity of over $ 250,000 , paying them an income of about $ 24,000 a year .
if that should ever happen I ask you remind me of this moment so that I may correct myself and offer to others the kind of respect that I would expect to receive from them .
Mr. Speaker , as the member for Laval West , I want to congratulate the government on its Speech from the Throne to open the first session of the 36 th Parliament of Canada in which it set out its priorities for the years ahead .
it is a great pleasure that I join in the debate on the Speech from the Throne , representing my electorate of Markham .
the Canadian Wheat Board along with CSIS are the two organizations that are not affected by the access to information legislation .
the economy is growing .
as provincial and territorial governments struggle to absorb the federal spending cuts and community hospital cuts , many Canadians fear the health care system they has come to count on may not be there when they need it .
the Reform Party wants to change that .
as far as job creation goes , the member is exaggerating somewhat when he says that there is absolutely no disagreement about the fact that employer and employee contributions to such a plan are job killers .
a new investment policy is required to secure the best possible return for contributors .
Mr. Jean - Paul Marchand
Mr. Grant Hill
the first one is not in order .
maybe he will visit the group of convicted Tory felons who now call the Regina correctional institute their home away from home .
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) :
a little later our current Prime Minister gets to drive the car .
culture
Mr. Speaker , unlike the Reform members , I find this an excellent question .
if he were in opposition surely he would be doing exactly the same thing .
the fact is that the deficit is on a downward track .
it is putting short term political considerations ahead of what is right for the country and that should not be tolerated .
let me say a few words about my immediate predecessor , Beryl Gaffney .
i want to read it because it is amusing , that " CPP contributions are savings toward pensions .
there is no money coming back into the economic system .
every contribution is known .
now health bureaucrats are trying to ruin her reputation and smother the truth .
i must tell you I owe these people a great deal .
Andr 茅 Tremblay , the former constitutional adviser to several of Quebec ' s premiers , including Robert Bourassa , said that the Calgary declaration was an empty shell , that it amounted to next to nothing .
given the nature of the discussion at this time , I think we can give the hon. member a little leeway .
i would like to acknowledge the very gracious tributes paid to Mr. Fraser from members of all sides of the House .
the federal government had an old age pension scheme , but , of course , the provinces had principal responsibilities in health , welfare and housing .
he said so yesterday .
Ms. Judi Longfield ( Whitby - Ajax , Lib . ) :
what we want to know is who in the government was aware of this illegal practice ?
it will not work .
i would ask the hon. member to address the Chair .
it is criminal .
Mr. Nelson Riis :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to look at the last clause of the bill .
high PERFORMANCE HOCKEY PROGRAM
income TAX ACT
the Hon. John Manley :
the former justice minister agreed that convicted rapists should not walk the streets , that they should be doing time .
introduction and first reading
if I did , there was no intention on my part to be disrespectful to anyone .
the word " people " has several connotations which may give rights in international law , but we use the word " society " because it is more inclusive .
now it is doubling from that early start .
yesterday we had an incident in the House where the word treasonous was used by a member putting a question to a minister .
over the course of the past summer the minister responsible for the wheat board continued to conduct informal consultations with the grains industry officials to hear views on the legislation .
Ms. Libby Davies
it hit right at the time of the election .
we must start to be aware of that in the types of programs we design .
we finally have a Parliament in which these kinds of issues can and will be raised .
i acknowledge the history of that notion .
Mr. Speaker , if anybody is going to make up with anybody , perhaps the hon. member might make up with his leader whom he consigned to the scrap heap of history yesterday .
when I first entered Parliament , Canada faced a major crisis of poverty among seniors .
hear , hear .
the reason we have made this year the year of the Asia - Pacific is Canadians know that the gate to the Asia - Pacific for our country is Vancouver and British Columbia .
he fed us a line .
without these changes future generations would have to pay 14.2 % for the same benefits we are currently paying only 5.85 % for .
it would seem to me that we all want to be pluralistic .
i can tell him that officials in my department and in my office are currently talking to those involved across Canada in the preparation of this strategy .
still there is something happening in my community which goes far beyond enthusiastic forecasts and strong growth .
they are there but they do not do the job they were intended to do .
( motion agreed to )
the government of which I am a member has reiterated on a number of occasions that any constitutional amendment must be the subject of a reasonable consensus within the minorities affected .
absolutely not .
why have so many Canadians lost faith in our justice system and particularly our courts ?
it would be an apprenticeship program that would marry the needs of society with the aspirations of our young people .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
i am proud to be part of this government which has restored an infrastructure of hope and confidence for Canadians since it took office in 1993 , because it understands the changing world .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a question of privilege in regard to the matter of introducing government public bills in the Senate .
board OF INTERNAL ECONOMY
Mr. Randy White :
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
i started as a busboy in the parliamentary restaurant with nothing but respect for this great institution .
may I also say that we have achieved some real progress in areas like life expectancy and infant mortality over the last 15 or 20 years , and we intend to keep investing in that kind of effort .
the minister has already interfered in the bargaining process and he has failed to notify the Canadian public of the imminence of this strike .
there is absolutely nothing wrong with that .
i noticed that on the Liberal side we have what is typically the return of Liberalism .
that is not all .
i expect to conclude the address debate next Thursday and Friday .
you can be assured of my personal support .
Mr. Bill Blaikie :
that is going to impose incredible hardship on a lot of people .
finally , your petitioners request Parliament to address their concerns by supporting my private member ' s motion No. 33 , which would include parental rights and responsibilities in the charter of rights and freedoms .
my constituents call on Parliament to urge the governor general to appoint a duly elected person to the forthcoming vacant British Columbia seat in the Senate of Canada .
this enactment will give the basis for the enforcement of fair pricing between the manufacturer who sells the product at retail , either directly or through an affiliate , and also supplies the product to a customer who competes with the supplier at the retail level in order to give the customer a fair opportunity to make a similar profit .
their attitudes could have -
taxes in Canada from all levels of government account for more than one - third of the GDP .
dear colleague , you are not to use the name of the minister but rather her title .
this is typical of Liberal smoke and mirrors .
will he walk out of the House , call the chief commissioner of the CWB , cancel the CTA hearing and get a review under way right now ?
in addition to CSIS , another government agency not held accountable under access to information is the Canadian Wheat Board .
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan :
will the Liberal government hold a public review of any new justice appointed to the supreme court ?
i hope the experiments leaving for MIR today , which testify to the inquisitiveness and ingenuity of Canadian youth , will be an unqualified success .
why should it not be ?
in the Speech from the Throne we hear that we have a surplus and the next big debate for us to concern ourselves with is how to spend it .
i refer specifically to countries like Norway and Denmark where children do not live in poverty because their parents do not live in poverty .
Mr. Speaker , I know very well that the Tories cannot understand that the EI account can have a surplus .
over time it will help reduce child poverty , strengthen families and enable governments to work further for Canada ' s children .
every day of every week in 700 projects in over 500 communities across the country , 7,500 volunteer hours per week are devoted to these projects that are intended to ensure that children have a hot meal in the morning before they go to school , that they are protected from abuse , prepared to learn and that they get the kind of guidance they need in their earliest years .
i also listened very carefully to the remarks of the member for Sherbrooke .
you must ensure that we can discuss in this Chamber with civility the viewpoints of Canadians from coast to coast to coast in helping to guide the governance of this great country .
the Bloc must stop tarnishing our institution to promote its separatist dream .
these , however , are not the only choices available to Quebecers .
Mr. Odina Desrochers
they would love me to stop talking about the 1.4 million people who are out of jobs ?
therefore paragraph ( 2 ) is in practice part of the provincial constitution of Quebec and can be amended using the section 43 amending formula .
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) :
what is before the House are important recommendations for improvements and changes to the plan to make sure that it is fair and equitable among generations , that it is sustainable and that we do the right thing .
the outcome of this first attempt at streamlining is commendable but the process is far from complete .
our trade has shot up .
we consider the import and export of hazardous waste to be a very serious situation .
the NDP believes that the voters must be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system .
an hon. member :
we are angry .
we are talking about another very important matter today , the financing of federal political parties .
but that impudence changes to cynicism when one realizes that the Liberals are reducing the deficit with provincial funds for health and education , as well as with funds hijacked from employment insurance .
we are taking this advice to heart .
this is terrible .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Health .
as Thomas Jefferson stated , the care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the first and only legitimate object of good government .
Canadians may not know that 9 percent of our country ' s economic input and 50 percent of all employment is involved in that sector , but the people of Perth - Middlesex do .
that is the only way he is going to be able to show the Canadian people accountability , through actions like giving up his pension .
indeed some of the clauses regarding information sharing and investigations require close scrutiny but that will be done at a later time .
in fact , the Royal Society of Canada estimates that , in the year 2000 , greenhouse gas emissions will exceed the 1990 reference level by 9.5 percent .
the National Parole Board and Correctional Service Canada -
this will be a win - win situation and we will not burden future generations .
first of all , does he agree with this ?
i am disappointed and embarrassed to watch the premier of Quebec asking for a favour from France as a cat might come asking to be patted .
first , we have kept good statistical analysis of how the drugs are being used so that we can track abuse .
for all intents and purposes we have achieved a national consensus on the need to rethink the role of government , to set priorities in support of economic growth in employment through innovation .
i thank them for their love and support .
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) :
all of those people who have pensions now can look forward to that same pension over the years without change .
canada PENSION PLAN
bluntly stated , the proposed changes to the CPP are completely unfair to our children and to younger working Canadians in three ways .
the federal and provincial governments are committed to developing alternatives to incarceration for non - violent offenders who can safely and effectively be managed in the community .
just because those bills have been introduced in the Senate in the past does not make it right .
Chile has been on that plan for 16 years .
i was remiss in not congratulating the new minister of agriculture on his appointment .
for the time being , we are talking about an investigation , not about charges made before the courts .
the petitioners state that Parliament should ask the government to authorize a proclamation to be issued by the Governor General under the Great Seal of Canada to amend section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to recognize the fundamental right of individuals to pursue family life free from undue interference by the state and recognize the fundamental rights and responsibilities of parents who direct the upbringing of their children and urge the legislative assemblies of the other provinces to do likewise .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
the hon. member is right on both counts .
i expect that will continue .
the aboriginal head start program is another one that I think is certainly very important to the children of aboriginal parents to ensure that they get the best possible start in their lives .
members of this House deserve to know that Canada was invited to testify at those hearings .
unfortunately , the average Canadian family is growing poorer every day .
what were the criteria ?
how will she continue to justify gouging taxpayers ?
pursuant to the authority granted to me by Standing Order 11 , I order you to withdraw from the House for the remainder of this day ' s sitting .
is she going to stick to that campaign promise , or will she be forced to resign a second time ?
Mr. Odina Desrochers :
i would like to refer to the speech we have just heard from the hon. member for Algoma - Manitoulin .
the hon. member for Medicine Hat is quite at liberty to suggest that debate is needed on what is the optimal size of government debt .
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen :
our economic security tomorrow will surely be influenced by the concern we demonstrate today for the interests of the next generation .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
the Speaker :
i am also reminded that no matter how far away we may now be from the farm , if we are still in the habit of eating three times a day , we have a vested interest in the state of agriculture and in agricultural reform .
if not , will it admit that it has simply given up doing anything to help the young people who most desperately need its help ?
Mr. Ted McWhinney
is that what we are all about ?
i welcome heckling when I am speaking .
madam Speaker , I wish I could say at the outset that it is a pleasure to rise today to address Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act , but the simple truth of the matter is that it is not .
we have said they are forgeries .
indeed it is Canada ' s competitive advantage in the sense that no part of the world is alien to our Canadian citizenry .
surely the government takes that seriously enough to investigate those independent of the appeal happening .
criminal CODE
when Quebeckers know that , by voting for sovereignty , they will be leaving Canada , they change their minds .
they said " Let ' s postpone the debate '' .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion :
anyone who cannot differentiate between a loan and a donation has a serious problem .
before I came to Parliament I was involved in community justice and the building of a safer and more secure community through the Community Safety and Crime Prevention Council of Waterloo region .
one of the things that gratified me in the first instance , during the Saguenay flood , was how Manitobans and westerners - I am a western Canadian - rallied .

the Speaker :
i am not here pretending to have answers but I am here to try to help .
Mr. Speaker , it is a difficult process and it is something which deserves more time and attention .
edited HANSARD * NUMBER 13
the government is living up to that commitment .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
one of these issues is the rebalancing of powers within Confederation .
none .
in part there is the reimbursement of election expenses .
hon. members will know that any proceeding in the other place is totally out of bounds in terms of raising it in this House .
that was a condition of the sentence .
Mr. Speaker , as is the custom , investigations by the RCMP are always made at arm ' s length from the government .
on this occasion I give thanks for the tremendous contribution that Stanley Knowles made to the House of Commons , to my party and to the people of Canada .
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
i can see it now .
that is the federal system .
recently I read about an Asian centre that is being built in Surrey .
it clings to the assumptions of a bygone age and it means the system cannot work .
might I request that his intervention be put off perhaps to another time .
with all due respect , I will put the question to the Prime Minister rather clearly , so everyone can understand what it is about , given that I have only one question .
there could be a number of other measures that he can certainly discuss with the finance minister but my job in the government is to provide certain programs and services .

hon. Don Boudria : - and I would ask the Chair to consider the matter .
it is his own guy .
these proposed changes to the CPP will ensure that Canadians will continue to have an economically viable and stable pension plan that meets their future retirement needs .
Mr. Joe Jordan
* * *
we have a budget to travel to our ridings and to maintain our relationships with our wives and children .
they are very quiet .
we heard no one advocate gutting the benefits of the Canada pension plan or other pillars of the Canadian pension system .
you know , the Natural Sciences Engineering and Research Council , the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the Medical Research Council of Canada offered , for the last year available , bursaries worth $ 175 million to 13,359 students .
the member for Athabasca has the floor .
in fact , the member for Brome - Missisquoi took the initiative to organize exchanges between ridings from across Canada and towns and villages in his riding .
the Speaker :
we made a commitment in the red book to make sure of that and because we now have a dividend we can turn some of that toward the national debt .
every budget in the past four years has broken this promise , and the corporation has had to absorb $ 350 million in cuts .
they no longer accept certified cheques .
is it any wonder that over 50 % of Canadians have lost faith in our courts and in our justice system after witnessing the arrogant attitude that tampering with justice and the rule of law is acceptable .
taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income ignores the element of risk that an investor or entrepreneur brings to business , without which our economy would be stagnant .
nays
as somebody once pointed out , if one does not pay careful attention to history one is bound to repeat all of the mistakes .
i understand four members are still on the roster to speak .
we are in a very fortunate position in this country today , as a result of the measures and the fiscal responsibility exercised by this government , to begin to look at new ways and new programs and perhaps a new style of economics since we may in fact be heading for the first time in a long time toward the elimination of the deficit .
furthermore , people over the age of 65 as of December 31 , 1997 who chose to begin receiving CPP pension benefits after that date will not be affected by the changes either .
i suspect that most members of Parliament working in their constituencies inevitably spend a good deal of time with people who are having difficulty qualifying for Canada pension disability .
i simply wanted to add that I find the same to be true for the word " bamboozle '' .
this throne speech contains not a single reference to the fact that we should review the inequities in Canada ' s current employment insurance .
following his retirement , Mr. Fraser continued his involvement in the area of parliamentary affairs through the publication of two editions of Beauchesne ' s parliamentary rules .
the Leader of the Opposition rose to say that education is sacred .
hear , hear .
the third element raised by the Speech from the Throne is that we must devote the same kind of energies and effort to attracting investment as we do to stimulating trade in merchandise .
No.
some hon. members :
consumer AFFAIRS
Mr. Lorne Nystrom
Mr. Speaker , about three minutes after I find out , which I will attempt to do right after question period , I will let the opposition know where the passports are .
i am a Liberal of the English school .
sometimes Speakers can be given to a judicious blindness when it comes to motions being moved or to breaking new ground by actually arriving at a judgment on this in time to prevent this very unfortunate reaction on the part of the government to the fact that there was lively , informed and concerned debate about CPP reform and it moved to choke it off in the way that it did .
Mr. Speaker , Bombardier retains its cosy relationship with the current Liberal government .
hon. Don Boudria :
my riding , like many other rural ridings , has been continually losing its most cherished asset to larger urban centres .
we must investigate partnerships with the private sector .
the Speaker :
then he got a note from somewhere and said no , it was not other people and Canadian officials actually were investigating that they were forged .
i call on members opposite to support this very important legislation .
it is very strange that the government would mention the unique character of Quebec society and the diversity inherent in the federation and yet not mention equality .
it has to do with the way in which the Canada and Quebec pension plans are calculated .
KINGSTON PENITENTIARY
Mr. Speaker , I am indeed honoured to rise in the House today , the House that John George Diefenbaker , Pierre Elliott Trudeau and Tommy Douglas have spoken in .
when the employee makes a contribution to the CPP he too is making an investment .
there were of course a number of such misunderstandings , but I targeted four .
for every single student this handout is intended to help , the program hurts nine more .
foreign AFFAIRS
we were elected to this House to debate legislation .
essentially , maximum election expenses were raised by 30 % . These expenses can no longer be incurred by third parties . Candidates will have their expenses reimbursed .
Mr. Speaker , let me congratulate you on your appointment .
* * *
their experience and counsel were very important to us .
let us get the facts straight .
in terms of jobs , if the member of the Reform Party would unplug his ears and listen , he would find out that the greatest expenditure in the country has been on the interest on the national debt , approximately 35 cents out of every dollar .
i am very pleased to announce to the House this afternoon that the government will be proceeding in a very timely fashion with the three cases involving alleged war crimes .
however , no one can deny the right of the Parliament of Canada to consult the voters who elect the members of this Parliament .
if somebody has committed a crime he will have to face justice and accept the decision of the court .
it is a great pleasure for me to serve my constituents and I plan to serve them well .
i am very critical of what is in the throne speech from an economic point of view .
i can assure him that I expressed his concerns with regard to what is going on in Algeria at a meeting held this week at the Department of Foreign Affairs .
Mr. Jim Jones
i want them to know that I will work with all my heart to defend their interests .
there is a third option and this is the option favoured by the official opposition and by an increasing number of producers .
before I came to this place I had a small construction company that built about eight houses a year .
it is a first class example of participatory democracy .
interestingly enough , 51 calls favoured debt reduction .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , today we are debating the Canada pension plan .
they are just asking for a fair break and an opportunity to plan .
could the member rephrase the question .
hon. Andy Scott
they are just a skeleton , dry bones rattling against each other .
* * *
we must not rush into a plan without clearly knowing what the long term repercussions are .
it tries to balance public and private financing and allows rich people - there will always be some - as well as people coming from more modest backgrounds , myself included , to run for election and to sit in the House of Commons .
each of them calls on the government to reject proposed changes to the Canada Health and Drug Act that would prevent people from taking dietary supplements or herbal goods of their own choice .
we have to point out to the people that spending our way out of this is not the solution .
madam Speaker , we spent quite a bit of taxpayers ' dollars on the 12 - year review of the Young Offenders Act .
Mr. Speaker , I am greatly interested in my colleague ' s words .
Mr. Wayne Easter
* * *
what would be a better way ?
the situation is unique to this Parliament , so I ask that you be patient and consider my arguments carefully .
accordingly , this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
at one of the international meetings I recently attended , a world leader told me that only Canada could have been the leader in the campaign against landmines .
these effects only stand to reason .
we may have a few concerns , some constructive criticism , but in general terms , we will vote in favour of the bill ' s being sent to committee .
agriculture
he is somebody who raised funds for the Liberal Party .
there are some very serious problems that need to be addressed .
i have just heard the booming voice of the biggest teller of tall tales we have ever heard in this House .
introduction and first reading
his response was " Well , Madam , you know in life some people are lucky , some are not '' .
the issue concerning the $ 20 million that has already been spent by his department in this area was done , as was indicated , in connection with other organizations including the United Fishermen .
the workers of Dartmouth , and they are hard workers , have been rocked by another grim reality .
there are also people who do not qualify at all for employment insurance , such as part time workers in hospitals , schools , plants , and so on .
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY
fisheries
the Speaker :
with respect to the characteristics and qualifications of these directors , the bill only specifies that they be representatives of various regions of Canada and have proven financial ability or experience .
i draw the attention of members to the presence in the gallery of members of a delegation of parliamentarians from the National People ' s Congress of the People ' s Republic of China .
it is with a great deal of humility that I stand here as their member of Parliament .
first , Canadians want the CPP to remain .
no , they are heckling .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy :
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the minister just said a few minutes ago that these Canadian passports were forged .
canada POST
this way , provincial and territorial governments would be forever protected against cuts like those imposed by the Liberals .
Canadians will be consulted , but we will consult on how we deliver our promise and not whether .
while it is not clear to which regulations he is referring I wish to make the following points .
in 1993 in my riding the Stony reserve had programs in place that were doing good work for a lot of the aboriginal people .
Canadians understand and 80 percent have told us in a 1996 Angus Reid poll that they want aboriginal issues to be high or medium priority for their federal government .
is he saying or will he say now that in the absence of such amendments on future legislation there will be no closure , there will be no time allocation and we will be able to debate legislation until such time as the matter is confirmed or dismissed ?
there was no acknowledgement of that in the throne speech .
a lawyer by training , Mr. Fraser came from a Liberal family of long standing in his province of birth .
* * *
election campaigns are about power .
at times tempers will flare but we must always remember that together we are representatives of the Canadian family .
Ms. Aileen Carroll
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Luiz employs more than 30 people and works hard to succeed .
this is the first chance I have had to speak with you in the chair .
canada has become a major global trading country because of its diversity of cultures and the insightfulness it brings .
members sang the national anthem ]
that is why the government is so gung ho about RRSPs .
the senator was just reflecting the extreme frustration that British Columbians feel .
i would like to ask the hon. member of the Liberal Party two questions , and I would appreciate an answer .
that right wing extreme conservatism has done this country an awful lot of harm over the years and now the Reform Party wants to carry it even further by totally privatizing the Canada pension plan .
we need to look at establishing a national apprenticeship style program for our young people , recognizing there are provincial implications , but co - operation would be the key here .
prostate CANCER
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Philip Mayfield ( Cariboo - Chilcotin , Ref. ) :
some people are convinced that they are entitled to this tax .
my question for the member has to do with the issue of being an independent member and voting the will of the people , as the member would put it .
could the member please respond to that ?
yet , this is precisely what this government is attempting to do .
we in the Reform Party will work hard in the committee and in the House to ensure that the seniors benefit legislation is right for seniors , taxpayers and for all Canadians .
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) :
the personal tax burden is to high and also because there is no money available to support the infrastructure necessary to conduct research .
the investigation began in mid - June , three months later .
while there are many ways the government can work to improve our way of life , it has targeted priority areas such as our youth , health care , innovation and national unity .
we will then rise for the Thanksgiving adjournment .
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) :
" trust us .
* * *
it was her labour actions and it was her attitude toward the workforce , those workers in Yellowknife , that caused all this .
when his report is received it will be made public and Canadians will see our reaction to his recommendations .
to add breadth and depth to national unity strategies we ask where are the policy initiatives to address the big regional concerns that are so apparent in this House ?
also , there is the fact that we have the fundamentals for the recovery well in place .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te
the Parti Quebecois government also says no .
i wonder if the hon. member could put his question very briefly , and we will allow the hon. member to reply .
this means in part making sure that Canadians forces have the right equipment for the job .
that is a total misnomer .
it does not go all the way to full democratization , but it certainly takes us down that road and puts control directly in the hands of producers .
some time ago , the official opposition in the National Assembly asked the Quebec government to set up a parliamentary committee on this issue .
Ms. Marlene Catterall
punch Imlach was able to bring the Stanley Cup to the Toronto Maple Leafs .
i suggest that members leave their desk , exit through the curtains and come to the table using the doors on the left and right sides of the chair on their respective sides of the House .
the Reform Party ' s agenda may indirectly result in reductions in jobs and not the increase Reformers constantly tell us about .
the message in what we heard rang loud and clear .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
the member talks about transfers and economics .
there has been a great deal of work done in the transportation department and the transportation committee on the issue of grain transportation and some of the problems in developing a truly competitive rail system .
i am presenting this question at the first possible opportunity since committees of the House were only struck yesterday .
i want to relate some of the expenditures of the past Liberal government and why those kinds of spending habits are of concern to the average Canadian .
everyone knows that .
edited HANSARD * NUMBER 11
the Speaker
Mr. Speaker , I was very interested to hear what the hon. member from the Liberal Party had to say .
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) :
the Government of Quebec was the first government in Canada to recognize the existence of the aboriginal nations .
i appeal to those people watching and listening to this debate today , I appeal to our city cousins , to listen to the dilemma farmers are in because they have no control over the minister of the Canadian Wheat Board .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) :
this year is drier than ever and the few bones that are in it rattle together with an ominous sound '' .
criminal CODE
Mr. Speaker , what I can confirm officially is that annually in Canada we have over 200,000 immigrants who will become Canadian citizens and whom we are very proud to welcome .
it looks at the work to retirement transition including the possibility of providing partial CPP pensions to Canadians wanting to make a gradual transition to retirement .
the government also promised that those now receiving disability benefits would not be affected by the measures .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
experts from the Canadian Aerospace Group and Sikorsky will be on hand to explain this unique project .
Mr. Myron Thompson
it has gone about reducing the deficit in four ways .
aren ' t you a jealous guy .
funding for these services to victims will be of utmost interest and it is hoped this minister will use her persuasive powers to encourage the government to adequately provide those resources .
there are no negative remarks coming from members of the Reform Party .
the Government will continue to renew the Public Service of Canada to ensure its members have the skills and dedication to continue serving Canadians well .
HOMECOMING '98
we are a great country and shall become one of the greatest in the universe if we preserve it .
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
if the hon. member does not understand a thing about democracy , perhaps he should be talking directly to some of the farmers .
Mr. Larry McCormick ( Hastings - Frontenac - Lennox and Addington , Lib . ) :
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
to promote more investment in Canada however , we must be even more aggressive in promoting Canada around the world .
Mr. Speaker , in reply to the hon. leader of the opposition , he will be aware , as the prime minister told the House , that it is absolutely unacceptable to the Government of Canada that anybody should be authorized by a foreign government to use Canadian passports to perpetrate an illegal act .
Mr. Speaker , I support the government ' s priorities outlined in last Tuesday ' s throne speech .
the Speaker :
Mr. Nelson Riis
at the same time I cannot see how the hon. member cannot recognize that Canadians helped to pay so that we could get this deficit under control .
it reads :
it is not something the government wants to get involved in on a daily basis , but there is going to be constant visibility of the mandate of this board .
madam Speaker , when the issue was emerging a couple of years ago I consulted with my constituents .
whereas it is desirable , for that purpose , to amend the Constitution Act , 1867 so that Quebec may recover its full capacity to act in matters of education ;
we are trying to go with the change .
we for our part support this bill .
surely not those who have signed on to trade agreements with dispute settlement mechanisms with the United States and Mexico .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Friday , October 3 , 1997
i am sure the member for Burin - St.
that is true .
it is also the way to create jobs in this country .
Mr. Speaker , I have looked in Beauchesne ' s sixth edition , page 142 , the section on unparliamentary language .
Mr. Chuck Strahl
some hon. members :
frank is very personable and he has tremendous family values .
using Canadian passports may be good for counter - terrorist missions , but it unfortunately jeopardizes the reputation of our passport and of Canadians who travel abroad every year .
amendment negatived .
the second reason a public debate is necessary is because we are not in agreement with the way in which the federal government went about getting its fiscal house in order .
madam Speaker , I would like to follow up on my Liberal colleague ' s comment about negative comments and the negative campaign .
throughout our long history , we have learned to set our differences aside and work together to build a great country .
you could request witnesses or anything that would help your decision in this matter .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed . )
the agreements that are entered into with First Nations ensure a level of accountability .
they should have stood and applauded , not congratulated the government if that made them feel a little queasy .
Mr. George Proud
it even gave up the right for the financiers , Newcourt Credit , to establish their own police force on this highway .
the polling booths are now open .
therefore there are many implications of that wheat board that have a great effect on other regions of Canada .
we have five recognized parties in the House and that means we require a mature and modern approach to deal with it .
let me outline for the House the major consequences of massive government debt that haunt and will continue to haunt future generations of Canadians .
instead I found , for example , the Leader of the Opposition criticizing Bill C - 2 because it does not have a preamble .
some hon. members :
Ms. Beth Phinney
i commend the premiers and territorial leaders on the recent Calgary initiative .
the Speaker :
still others are finding post - secondary education to be prohibitively expensive .
reform members are discussing the fact that they feel this is completely inappropriate that farmers , those who sit on the board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board should be completely open and susceptible to any charge or allegation , even if it comes from the benches of hon. members opposite .
we have also introduced the opportunities fund to further the economic integration of persons with disabilities .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
do not tell me that there is a simple solution , that if we put some dollars into people ' s pockets somehow that will solve all of our unemployment problems .
Monday , September 22 , 1997
and fewer benefits at that .
there are no easy choices .
the Salvation Army was pleased to recognize her dedicated and practical service to mankind by awarding her this distinction .
Mr. Philip Mayfield
the government announced that it will do something to help students some day in the future .
Mr. Speaker , I have quite a large number of petitions so I ask for your patience in introducing them .
there are 1.4 million children living in poverty .
government Expenditures
there is also a treatment component .
Mr. Robert D . Nault
i organized a group in Edmonton .
i am trying - with some success , I believe - to give a true picture of what they are ; they in turn illustrate quite well what I represent .
they are following the Reform right down in a rush to the bottom .
i have seen the positive impact of sports on young people ' s lives , teaching many skills such as teamwork , determination and commitment .
while our principles may vary somewhat , I am optimistic enough to believe that deep down within most of us , we have one common desire and that is to build a better society for this generation and for the generations to come .

hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
i would take this opportunity to thank those who re - elected me a third time with a majority of over 50 percent .
Mr. John Finlay
when is he going to get it ?
they could develop a model .
it has been a real nice experience to listen to the debate today .
Mr. John Bryden :
taxation
Mr. Speaker , I remind the hon. member that if he is a part of the finance committee then he will be going across the country consulting with the people on that very question .
i gave a statement in the House the other day in which I pointed out that young people today , like the member who was speaking , pay $ 3,400 a year for 35 years to pick up a pension of about $ 8,800 a year , when that same money invested in a very modest RRSP style plan for the same number of years would end up with an annuity of something like $ 92,000 a year .
our mission is not merely the preservation of political power but to harness the awesome strength that we have been given and channel it toward the perpetuation of freedom , peace , prosperity and unity .
while advocating a sovereign Quebec , the Bloc Quebecois is asking all Quebecers , whether they are federalists or sovereignists , Socialists , Liberals , Conservatives , ADQ or PQ supporters , to rally around and join forces to fight for the democratic rights of Quebeckers as well as for their institutions and their freedom to decide their future .
the Speaker :
this government , like previous Liberal regimes before it , arrogantly believes it knows what is best for people and continues to introduce legislation that is not in the best interest of future generations and that is intrusive and inflexible .
every day in this country police officers sacrifice their own personal safety in order that the rest of us remain protected from the criminal acts of a few .
enhanced funding for student summer placements will continue .
i urge us to take that obligation very seriously .
we do not have problems , we have challenges .
he keeps saying that Canada is one of the richest countries in the world .
one of the problems we have in society today is that too many things over the last number of years have been foisted on to government and the roles of family members and other organizations have gone by the wayside .
the Speaker
if the authorities in the Caribbean do not proceed with a charge , the people get away with what would clearly be a crime if committed in Canada .
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate the member for Saint Boniface for exposing to this House the confusion that reigns on the other side .
the minister in charge of the wheat board introduced amendments to the act in December of last year .
i think , my colleague , that this could more properly be discussed in the Board of Internal Economy .
Mr. Paul Forseth
we will also address the special needs of disadvantaged youth , especially those who face barriers to becoming self - reliant due to lower education , low skills or other social and economic factors .
that is a question I ask members opposite .
Mr. Bob Wood
as a new member of Parliament , the walls of my office are bare except for one framed poster I brought with me .
a few months earlier , the Prime Minister had offered him , with the unanimous consent of the House , to sit at the clerk ' s table .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
of course we are a Pacific nation as well and our view of the Americas does not stop at the Rio Grande .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday ' s throne speech gives Canadians every reason to be worried about their future retirement plans .
after all , this huge pool of capital would be a great temptation to any government .
the current prime minister was Trudeau ' s minister of finance and under Trudeau he learned to spend , indeed he liked to spend .
the participants insisted that a public pension system is instrumental in promoting fairness and alleviating poverty .
my wife ' s ancestors who came from Ukraine in 1910 travelled this conduit to settlement , as did many others who followed .
the Government of Canada will create a Canada - wide mentorship program .
i gather the member is originally from New Zealand .
with that in mind , I want to take a minute to compare the throne speech that opened the 35 th Parliament and the one delivered on Tuesday .
* * *
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
they want to cut , cut , cut so fast that they would bleed the country to death .
i do not want this dragged out .
now comes the most severe tax grab that we have ever had where the tax will be raised from 5.6 % to 9.9 % of a person ' s income .
the Speaker
finally , later yesterday afternoon before I proposed a motion on the floor of this House I even informed my counterpart in the official opposition which I believe was the good and proper thing to do so a motion would not be introduced behind his back .
we can only hope that this intention will take the form of support for creators and cultural industries .
Mr. Speaker , studies show that elderly people can minimize the loss of bone that may lead to osteoporosis , a debilitating bone disease that affects thousands of Canadian seniors by consuming the higher amount of calcium and vitamin D now recommended by the Osteoporosis Society of Canada .
speech FROM THE THRONE
this is just terrible .
in other words , the amendment is specifically designed to prevent us from having the committee study of the bill .
in English Canada , bilingualism is too often the last step to assimilation for francophones , which is just what the English provinces want .
they are also communities with great concerns about government , the size of government , the expenditures governments have and about their taxes and how they affect their disposable incomes .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
that was the government ' s position in 1995 .
that is a decision that the government might well take .
however , I have never , ever believed that the Conservatives would put more money into a program so I have no faith in that area .
the Government has regained the ability to address priorities of Canadians while living within its means .
YUKON WEATHER STATION
he called it scandalous .
it is a lump sum payment to help the close ones of a deceased contributor to pay for part of the funeral costs .
members opposite do not seem to realize that is what Reform is talking about .
Canadian democracy as imperfect as it is has nominated this Liberal crew and they have now tried to reassure us in this throne speech that we are on a voyage somewhere .
Mr. Speaker , you can be sure that I will be raising many issues in this House but I will take my critic areas very seriously .
madam Speaker , I am ready when he is , but this is not the right time .
Videon is a parent company of Auberge des Gouverneurs which is building the hotel .
i keep coming back to the word invest as opposed to spending .
they pay more than their fair share .
we extend our thanks to you in advance for your impartiality , your fairness and the important role which you will play in keeping us all in order and on topic .
the Speaker :
when I speak to the students with whom I went to university and hear their stories of graduating with degrees and significant student loan debts , my heart goes out to them .
its purpose is to advise the government .
simultaneously he spent over a billion dollars only to delay the necessary replacement of Canada ' s aging Sea King and Labrador helicopters .
i need only point out the unprecedented work of the Minister of Finance and his department in the annual prebudget consultations .
believe me it is not only the problem of the premier of Ontario .
Mr. Preston Manning
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
there is another rather complicated difference .
the first ministers will discuss the issue at their meeting this fall , as I mentioned earlier .
will he not admit that some of the problems of the past have been that the people of Cape Breton have sent the wrong people to Parliament and when they do this they get more of the same that he is asking for ?
Beauchesne ' s reference No. 57 on page 18 states " the House has in the past regarded the publication of the proceedings or reports of committees sitting in camera to be a breach of privilege '' .
my question for the prime minister is why will he not give surplus money back to the people instead of blowing it on things like fancy ski resorts or ice cream parlours ?
the House resumed consideration of the motion and the amendment .
such accounting details may be too complicated for my colleague for Bourassa , however .
Mr. Speaker , I do not think I have had the opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment .
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) :
i thank those from the former riding of Winnipeg North who now constitute nearly half of my adjusted riding of Winnipeg North - St.
the Prime Minister said so , but I have read nothing to that effect on the throne speech and , so far , the Minister of Health has not said a word about this commitment .
direct foreign investment in Canada increased by some 8 percent last year , reaching almost $ 180 billion .
this is a government and a minister that are prepared to seize the agenda for the future and to seize an agenda that puts in its first instance all the interests of Canadians , particularly those who are the most vulnerable in our society .
Mr. Yvon Godin
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
miss Deborah Grey
it is important to conclude one ' s speech .
national DEFENCE
it is true that , at one time , our region of New Brunswick was a nice , prosperous place , where people could find work .
Mr. Speaker , the citizens of New Brunswick and the constituents of the former federal riding of York - Sunbury are mourning the death of long - time resident and friend , John Chester MacRae .
he also notified the President of the Treasury Board , not in his capacity as President of the Treasury Board but as the federal minister responsible for Quebec .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
what is missing in this bill and is of great interest to me is mention of what will become of the seniors benefit , commonly called old age pension .
privilege
routine PROCEEDINGS
that this House condemns the attitude of the Government , which refuses to introduce in - depth reform of the legislation on the financing of federal political parties , and so on .
madam Speaker , I thank the member opposite for an excellent question .
Cyril Keeper then held this seat until 1988 .
Mr. Reed Elley
Mr. Mac Harb
Mr. Speaker , I must confess I am not exactly sure what the hon. member is referring to .
the LATE CLAUDE ELLIS
we must be sensitive because what is happening in Canada is that the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor .
i urge all members of the House to work together to fulfil their obligations as parliamentarians .
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :
some denigrate what Parliament can do but they are wrong .
as a consequence of the plan ' s being set up in a way that would allow benefits to reach full pension entitlement by 1975 , it was accelerated .
we are creating innovation within this act to respond to the needs of the day .
i am most grateful to them , as I am to all the citizens of Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford for their trust and their support .
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau ( Anjou - Rivi 猫 re - des - Prairies , Lib . ) :
we wish to repeat what we have already said in the last several days .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
while no doubt the matter is of considerable interest , the Chair does not take the view that this is a matter of emergency or one that would justify setting aside the normal business of the House in order to debate the subject .
he is talking about all the warm fuzzy stuff that the government is doing .
Mr. Speaker , I have a brief question for the member of the Reform Party .
Mr. Dick Harris
Mr. Speaker , first of all I would like to congratulate you on your appointment .
at this moment the provinces are doing their work .
most people we have talked to have indicated that the issue of transportation is equal to all others .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
the national government can do something useful in that regard .
government ORDERS
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan ( York North , Lib . ) :
i was at an event in my riding not long ago , the Dartmouth North community centre activity day .
Mr. Speaker , when you look into this instance in its entirety I know you will review all the discussions .
i have very grave difficulty with the wiping out the rights of these classes of people .
now we are entering a new era in Canadian public policy where we will have the first balanced budget in a long , long time .
a higher return on the plan ' s assets will help hold the line on increases in premiums .
at least they could bring it to the House or to committee so we could all look at where it was going .
i think he is pretty upset right now about some of the ways political parties use and abuse their funding powers .
the Newfoundland court of appeal ' s decision to halt construction of a road or airstrip at Voisey ' s Bay without a full scale environmental review may cost 3,000 construction and 2,000 permanent jobs in a part of Canada that most desperately needs employment .
every member has been tightly constricted in the debate , including the Leader of the Opposition .
Mr. Jack Ramsay
i have a shipyard , the most modern shipyard there is in Canada , in Saint John , New Brunswick .
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold :
regarding the democracy of bands themselves , there is democracy in the elections of their leaders .
research and awareness are key in our fight for a cure .
today marks the opening of a new Parliament , the last Parliament of the 20 th century and the first Parliament of the 21 st century , a Parliament with a unique and historic opportunity to provide leadership on national issues to secure the future for Canadians .
canada ELECTIONS ACT
Canadians are saying they want the federal government and the provinces involved .
some hon. members :
again with respect to the specific issue that has been on everyone ' s mind of late , we are looking for information about ministers of the crown who accompany fundraisers .
that did not start in 1989 .
i was delighted to see that a member of the 26 th Parliament , namely our prime minister , has asked a member of the 25 th Parliament , namely the deputy prime minister to initiate the organizational process required to appropriately mark our entry into the millennium .
members of the Salvation Army are here with us today in the gallery and I wish to welcome them to this Chamber .
as a result , Canada now has one of the best health systems in the world .
and this is still according to Jean Lesage , in 1965 .
many of us have teachers in our families and know first hand the commitment in time and energy they put into their jobs .
i am choosing a round as best I can in exercising discretion .
an hon. member :
it should give back to the provinces the $ 4.5 billion it has taken from them every year .
Tuesday , September 23 , 1997
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
would he be prepared to rise in his place and say that , because Quebeckers are French speakers in North America , his government can no longer talk of homogeneity , because such talk would essentially put an end to any future for Quebec .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
i can understand the hon. member ' s real concern because that was their policy .
it does not seem to me that it contradicts what I said .
the Conservatives shed their disguises this past week .
we have communicated with the government and it replied to the minister over the weekend and this morning that -
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
although they are not acceptable , these attacks against Quebec ' s democratic institutions are not the real problem .
George ' s for electing me and shouldering me with the enormous responsibility of representing them here .
the Government of Canada has the constitutional power to do this .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
why is he doing the same thing ?
in this particular case I will make an exception .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
i think she explained it rather well .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
resuming debate .
he is the leader of the fifth party , I believe .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this bill , an act to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment board and to amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts .
in doing so we have avoided radical changes to benefits .
they took little or no notice of the pain they were inflicting on Canadian families , Canadian workers and Canadian businesses over these last three and a half years as they grabbed this tax lever and over and over again pulled it and pulled billions of dollars more into their coffers .
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to share my time with the hon. member for Leeds - Grenville .
the Speaker :
so it is not normal .
to say we have been patient is an understatement .
we are increasing the national child benefit by $ 850 million starting in July and an additional $ 850 million .
it argues that spending $ 90 million to create 3,000 jobs will reduce the excessively high youth unemployment rate .
the Speaker :
Mr. Speaker , for several days now Bloc Quebecois members seem to have been on cloud nine following a statement made by President Chirac .
in and for each Province the Legislature may exclusively make Laws in relation to Education -
Mr. Paul DeVillers
they can fire us nonetheless .
Mr. Speaker , the government has made a mess of the Pacific salmon dispute .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
hon. Marcel Mass 茅
millionaires pay too much in taxes is what they are saying .
i was inspired .
he has indicated we want to hear extensive debate on what is the most important social program change in the last 20 years happening in this country .
i think no Quebecker need feel ashamed of how the anglophone community is being treated , and we must continue along that path , as we have in the health system .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
it does not talk about what kinds of investments should be made but leaves that to the private board .
one wonders whether the referendum ballot will have a red maple leaf printed at the top .
this throne speech fails to speak to that spirit in the west .
Mr. Monte Solberg
was part of the $ 50,000 or $ 25,000 he collected in Drummondville or in the Abitibi - T 茅 miscamingue region going to the party , with the rest going somewhere else ?
this closure " displays the utter disdain with which the government treats the Canadian people '' .
Canadian voters will probably be stuck with an immigration system incapable of preventing the entry of hundreds of bogus and criminal refugees every day , also incapable of deporting the offenders after years of taxpayer funded appeals .
it ranks among the top 10 Canadian exporters .
however , while this constitutional debate should address Quebec ' s concerns about the federation , it cannot deal exclusively with Quebec ' s concerns .
the result was that , as of last March - the figures will soon be out - the federal government ' s deficit will not exceed $ 10 billion , and next year it will drop to zero .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the Government will continue to be vigilant and responsible about keeping the financial affairs of the country in order :
i firmly intend to vigorously defend their interests and those of the people of Quebec , whatever their religion , their language , their culture or their country of origin .
both of the arguments raised by the House leader are extremely weak .
what do we have today ?
it is true that the accord allowed for the election of senators , but clause 4 of the accord , which amended section 23 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Constitution Act of 1867 , allowed for the indirect election of senators by provincial legislatures .
i think of my previous colleague , Stanley Knowles , and many others who have worked hard to ensure that the standard of our plans in support of seniors continue to increase and improve .

of course as New Democrats we especially regret that he was not here to enjoy our return to this Parliament with the status of an official party .
would he also agree in principle to raising the basic spousal exemption in the tax code to a level equivalent to the basic personal exemption so that stay at home parents are no longer penalized by this government ' s tax code ?
it calls on all governments and all Canadians to work together .
this is the arena where we all come to debate , to state our position , to bring forth the concerns of our constituency and our region .

Mr. Daniel Turp :
it is the last thing I would ever want to do in this House .
George ' s , a Newfoundland riding .
i am hoping , in your considerations , Mr. Speaker , that you will see fit to allow it to go to a committee so we can solve this serious problem .
during the member ' s comments he indicated that he felt the government had restored health to the nation ' s finances .

at present , a number of persons have lodged a complaint before the human rights tribunal .
hon. David Kilgour
i salute the government .
the hon. member for Broadview - Greenwood on a point of order .
i note that the House is currently debating the address in reply from the Speech from the Throne which offers a very general debate in which members are free to make remarks on any subject they wish .
that is why the aboriginal people are reminding you of the whole global climate change which is taking place .
to top it off , in with all the falsehoods she has uttered , as a member of Parliament , she has undermined this whole institution .
madam Speaker , I do not operate that way .
with this sobering historical parallel and Laurier ' s analogy before us let us analyse the government ' s speech from the throne .
air freight is the only reliable way to ship goods and perishable food .
i will permit the parliamentary secretary to respond .
the minister knows full well there is a culture of cover - up in that department that still exists and he still has not dealt with that .
clearly there is a lot at stake in the investment of the CPP fund .
never is the departure of a family member beneficial to the family or to the individual .
i was a little surprised to hear the opposition of the member for Portage - Lisgar to the new accountability provisions .
for those who already support it , striking the joint committee will give them the opportunity to reiterate their support .
he has had a long career in politics .
on this point , I support my colleague from Madawaska - Restigouche , but when he talks about the spending of the current federal government , I suggest he look in his own back yard to see what the Conservative Party did during its nine years in government .
he was also known as the Mr. Rules of this place , along with the former member for Winnipeg North Centre , Stanley Knowles .
it is not in here at all .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
Canadians want us to understand the relationship that aboriginal people have with work and innovation .
they must deal with facts and if they do not deal with facts I will intervene on the statements .
need I remind you that within a single mandate , the Minister of Finance , the Hon. Paul Martin , did a tremendous job of turning things around ?
we are , as we often repeat , according to the United Nations development index , the best country in the world in which to live .
for the opposition to produce two different amendments , the purpose of which is dilatory as admitted on the floor of this House today , and the purpose of which is only to make the same hon. members speak not once , not twice but even three times on the same bill at second reading is nothing short of a dilatory measure .
on the other hand he applauds the coal miners for digging up more coal which will create more emissions .
allegations like the ones being made by the Bloc do not help to improve democracy in Canada .
since she is so well disposed toward job creation , would the hon. member be prepared to meet with her Minister of Finance to explain to him that instead of keeping the contributions to the employment insurance fund at an artificially high level , a level which generates surpluses which will top $ 7 billion this year , reduction would in fact create employment ?
i want to be clear about this concept .
it has a very clear directive to the Quebec pension plan to invest moneys that will create jobs in the province of Quebec .
over the last four years I had an opportunity to travel to Europe and the Pacific rim .
one might think they might learn from trial and error , but the Liberals just cannot seem to shake their big government , high spending , high taxation mentality .
it is an honour not only to represent them but also to work hard on their behalf over the life of this 36 th Parliament .
our colleague speaks to us about national unity .
they then turned around and said , " One of the innovations in the financing of political parties in Quebec concerns the contributions that can only be made by voters '' .
Mr. Andrew Telegdi
we know that Canadian dieticians are the only health professionals with the proper training and skills to assess a person ' s nutritional health .
they will respond to change and they will deal with the challenges that face them in a very creative way .
the Speaker :
while several projects were completed I realized that to make a serious impression I could better serve Canadian unity from within a political party that truly supports Canadian unity .
unions , business organizations like the CFIB , in their discussions and representations to governments , finance committees and to members of the House , routinely refer to CPP contributions as payroll taxes .
the Speaker :
if a person is convicted of an indictable offence under the Criminal Code any moneys he or she may have made or may make in the future from the creation of a work based on the crime would be deemed proceeds of crime , subject to seizure by the crown .
despite the relevance of their remarks , the minister turned a deaf ear .
let assume for a moment that we spend all the revenues of Canada to pay our debt .
would it not be preferable to let Canadian workers keep the amount of this EI overpayment and let them have the freedom to spend , invest or save ?
it will continue its campaign for liberalized trade .
we have to ensure that every citizen and every member of the constituency of Etobicoke - Lakeshore feels safe in their home and in their community .

Mr. John Solomon

does the hon. member for Kamloops wish to respond to the comment made by the hon. member Prince George - Bulkley Valley .
whatever he decides to pursue in the future I am sure he will undertake with the same kind of zeal and passion with which he has approached his job as premier of the province of New Brunswick .
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
as the Prime Minister pointed out in his speech in reply to the Speech from the Throne , this Parliament will be the last one of this century and the first one of the new millennium .
there is another point missing from the debate .
to add insult to injury , RAMCO had agreed with Public Works to invest a further $ 120,000 to upgrade and renovate the facilities in order to better meet the department ' s requirements .
that sounds like a partnership between John Dillinger and Lucky Luciano .
i think the Reform Party , which has been very effective as an opposition , has to take a more balanced approach and realize that we have to start creating an atmosphere of hope in our public service and hope for some of our more disadvantaged .
i do not think that is something contained in this legislation and we should not detract from the importance of this legislation in trying to solve a separate problem .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Liberal government has known for months that Lucien Bouchard was going to France to get support for Quebec sovereignty .
how it is that tax hikers had no increase in jobs but the tax cutters had an increase in jobs ?
the fact that transportation was entirely ignored in the throne speech would indicate to me that instead of preparing for the 21 st century the Liberals aren ' t even up to speed with 19 th century leaders .
that is surely not the case .
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua
the government is not in compliance with its own pay equity legislation .
Mr. Dick Harris
i would like to make one observation with respect to what I have heard .
speaker ' s Ruling
over a three year period a government should be required to balance its books or call an election .
i would like to ask the valiant new member for Simcoe - Grey , who states his readiness to work with all members of this House , what concrete proposals he wishes to make to his Liberal caucus that will be of any help whatsoever to the agricultural sector , which has seen its net earning power weaken year after year , particularly since 1993 when his party came to power , and to our young people in particular , with their abnormally high rate of unemployment ?
as I assume my responsibilities as the member for St. Paul ' s , I want to thank my predecessor , Barry Campbell , for his hard work both in the riding and for his invaluable help as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance .
the people who control the money markets , the free traders and those who sing the praises of the multilateral agreement on investment stand today with the absent members of the Liberal government indicted in the court of public opinion .
we have to do whatever we can in partnerships and innovation to make sure that happens .
i think that while some of the information does seem to tend to favour the unions , it would at least settle a strike .
in 1997 , just barely one young person out of two has a full or part time job .
* * *
we were successful in that respect .
if the premiums were invested over 30 years or 40 years at normal market rates of return and managed by proven money managers , the return would be incredibly higher than the government is proposing to give younger Canadians .
Mr. Speaker , it was my responsibility , as soon as I got wind of these allegations , to inform the RCMP , and not my cabinet colleague , which would have been completely inappropriate .
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 I would like to present a petition that has been signed by over 1,500 individuals from across Canada .
we actually increased the rates that people could receive under the CPP and we set up the plan for more people to qualify .
i am looking for the facts .
is that not something ?
the government will have to pay a heavy price for having defiled its own institutions .

the company could not do business in Canada from Ontario , but once they located in Michigan they could trade into Canadian provinces .

the minister will be asked to table the document which he quoted from in the House .
for the first three years provinces will also have access to 50 percent of the new CPP funds that the board chooses to invest in bonds .
i am going to address my remarks pretty well to the business of reducing taxes and cutting taxes .
when the Conservative government left power it was about $ 530 billion .

is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?

Canadians dislike waste .
finally I would like to mention that of course many of the issues that come before this House are not issues that all of the constituents are interested in .
we would also guarantee that existing seniors would get the CPP benefits which were promised to them .
we all know that by being a part of the federation of Canada we get a great many benefits by being Canadian .
i am proud to confirm my support for the Prime Minister and the Government of Canada .
in my opinion the nays have it .
candidates , on the other hand , may only issue receipts once they have filed their nomination papers .
Canadian families and small business suffer under a heavy tax burden .
if we followed the Conservative government ' s legislative timetable , the premiums would literally be going through the roof at this point .
are those the kinds of programs that my colleague is condemning ?
madam Speaker , as I understood - and I apologize if I am mistaken - the caisses populaires made a contribution or something like that .
we must as members of Parliament in partnership with the government be prepared now to answer to the future needs of our children or else in this 36 th session of Parliament we will have failed in contributing to this period of Canadian history entrusted to us .

yet there is not a flicker of recognition in the speech from the throne of that desire for accountability , not even a willingness to look at some of the mechanisms that can be used to hold people more accountable : greater use of referenda mechanisms ; greater use of citizens initiatives ; treating petitions with respect instead of parading them here in the House and storing them in the basement the next day never to see light again .
Mr. Ted McWhinney
Mr. Speaker , we check with people well informed about their ridings .
does the minister recognize that there are those who claim that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms could potentially weaken the authority of the National Assembly , by invalidating entire chunks of the act ; does he agree that I am right when I rise in my place to make that argument , and does he agree that it is not desirable that francophones who have a unique responsibility on this continent could see their language rights weakened by a Constitution that was never recognized by the National Assembly ?
we did not mention this in our platform but this idea deserves some real study on how we can offer some tax relief .

Ms. Elinor Caplan
when the minister said in the House that Mr. Coffey ' s allegations were not true , he must have had evidence to back up that assertion .
the government of which he is a part has signed free trade agreement after free trade agreement enshrining the very ethic that he just spoke against .
when will the government finally show leadership and live up to its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ?
Mr. Ted White
i am sorry , but I found it a bit uninspiring .
i watched that party across the way during the election .
health AND DRUG ACT
this award recognizes outstanding performance by a smaller exporter in the global forum .
we go to bat for people and help make their cases .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
they have watched me make Canadian history and they are watching me today in the chambers of the House of Commons .
constitutional resolutions which are to be considered by the House of Commons are as a rule considered by a special joint committee .
let me try to describe the changes today .

questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
as we have been saying since our arrival in this House in 1993 , we do not want to reduce the government ' s deficit by cutting assistance to the least well - off and hardest - hit members of our society , including the unemployed .
this is one of our greatest responsibilities .
i find it very strange that a fundraiser for the Liberal Party of Canada would demand cash contributions .
the bill states that the minister may not make the recommendation for exclusion unless the board of directors so recommends and the Canadian Grain Commission has approved a procedure for identifying the grain in question , so as to preserve its identity .
this is a treaty that was signed when the party of Senator Carney was in power .
we will be introducing legislation to increase health care transfers to the provinces in accordance with the recommendation of the National Forum on Health that the cash floor be $ 12.5 billion .
there is a movie that was popular about eight to twelve years ago called Starman in which the alien makes the following comment about humans : " You are at your best when things are worst '' .
because they are the ones who had to do his " dirty job '' .
there are only a few years of experience .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
they cut their taxes but increased their total revenues .
i urge the government to make positive changes to this policy .
the issue , however , of the salmon treaty is an important one .
Mr. Bill Matthews ( Burin - St.
that is what makes us all proud and different Canadians .
members will see that the legislation is grossly unfair to younger contributors , continues to perpetuate poor management and investment practices , and is out of touch with the needs , desires and aspirations of Canadians .
what should a balanced budget look like ?
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of the Environment .
Mr. Rick Laliberte
Mr. Speaker , committees are masters of their own business .
the Deputy Speaker :
they do not want a mortgage on the province , on our children and on our future .
it misleads the people of this country .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on behalf of the people of the constituency of South Shore in Nova Scotia to speak in reply to the throne speech which opened the 36 th Parliament .
we must invest in knowledge and creativity .
there always was , by the way .
Mr. Andrew Telegdi
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
for me , Canada is also Quebec , dear colleague .
some hon. members :
government ORDERS
Mr. Michel Guimond
i am now going to give a brief history of this bill .
parents got poorer as a result of , among other things , the employment insurance program implemented in January , which consistently reduces benefits and which also excludes many adult workers from the labour force .
shining through all of this is the fact that 50 cents of every dollar that Canadians earn goes to taxes in one form or another .
then we might have unity .
they cannot be replaced .
finally , the major increase will be a particular burden for young people as much of what we are going to have in the CPP is going to be an intergenerational transfer of wealth or income from younger people to their parents or their grandparents .
i can assure the member that the quality of policing will not suffer and crime will not increase .
not only do we have to supply the best possible commodities , which we do , there is no problem with that , but we have to supply them on a regular , consistent and reliable basis .
my colleague , the member for Burin - St.
hon. Herb Gray
Canadians and Reformers are realistic .
Mr. Bryon Wilfert ( Oak Ridges , Lib . ) :
the government should not be proud of this .
we can do it in a balanced way set forth in the election platform .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
self - employed small business people will face an increased payroll tax burden of some $ 3,600 a year .
despite their crucial role , many rural women face serious limitations in access to land , credit , agricultural extension services and other key resources .
Mr. Jason Kenney
in Canada at this point in time we have no similar regime .
the Canadian Chamber of Commerce , the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , le Conseil du patronat du Qu 茅 bec all share the view that these premiums must come down .
first , one of the major concerns I have about the changes to the Canada pension plan is the whole issue of premiums .
the author demonstrates in his book that the basic reason why in 1982 we adopted a charter with language rights incompatible with those of the National Assembly was to invalidate Bill 101 .
Mr. Speaker , allegations that Revenue Canada gives preferential treatment to any courier company in this country are false and unfounded .
therefore , I ask the Leader of the Opposition to make a careful reading of Quebec ' s reality .
one of his colleagues and said those people who are getting Canada pension are getting 200 percent return on their money .
nowadays , there are five people of job age for every retired person .
my objective today , in setting out the government ' s program to this House , is to explain our vision of Canada ' s economic and social development in a global knowledge - based economy .
fourth , what is the optimal level of taxes ?
Mr. Greg Thompson
those are the things that we know based on what has gone on before .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for her question .
if the head of the Bloc Quebecois and the leader of the party are one and the same person , I would have some questions to put to him .
Mr. Speaker , I agree with the hon. member that the credits earned by both partners should be theirs and there should be total equality .
he also was a signatory and an important player just last month in the Calgary declaration .
fair enough .
let me say that when the deficit is settled , when we are sure that the country is healthy , we will spend time looking at taxation .
the throne speech announced an increase in funding for community based crime prevention initiatives to $ 30 million a year , further demonstrating our commitment to helping communities deal with the roots of crime .
first , fuller funding .
Mr. Speaker , would the Minister of Public Works and Government Services share with the House how the conflict opposing Bradson Security Services and its locked out security officers was finally resolved after almost a year ?
it is therefore an honour and a great privilege to be able to represent and to serve that population , one with a rather exceptional voter turnout of 78 percent , 47 percent of whom voted for me as the candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada .
the benefits of trade extend to every part of our economy and affect all Canadians , the farmer who grows wheat , the engineer who designs tractors and the factory worker who builds planes .
there was the Sinclair Stevens affair , the Oerlikon affair , the influence peddling affair involving MP Gris 茅 , the tainted tuna affair and the Airbus affair , which is still causing a stir today .
it is a good issue to be referred to a committee so we can solve the problem of private members and ensure that all private members ' bills and amendments are drafted as quickly as possible so they can do their job .
the people directly affected by this , the mining communities of Cape Breton , voted against this proposal and maintain their belief that the mine should be developed under the auspices of the Cape Breton Development Corporation .
with the changes being proposed , will that be the case in the future ?
while I am congratulating and thanking people , I would certainly like to thank the people of the grand old constituency of Wetaskiwin for returning me to the House of Commons for the second time .
Allan Tough , an actuary from Alberta , states in the Calgary Herald the importance of acting now : " With any problem it is better to face up to it now rather than later .
they ask that the Food and Drug Act be revised in various ways , including that the definition of food include dietary supplements and foods for special health uses and that the definition of drug be amended to read " drug includes any substance other than food '' .
the debate in this House in this session is the lead off to why we are going to see a revolution in this country to change the tax system .
that is what I mean by distorting the reality behind public finances .
Mr. Speaker , I heard the comment of the leader of the Conservative Party that any increase in the rates of the Canada pension plan system would have to be offset by tax breaks .
they now no longer try to help .
it would not be there in our time , in our generation , and perhaps even within the life of this Parliament .
introduction and first reading
we are not waiting for the response to the Somalia inquiry report .
almost half of Canada ' s four million people with disabilities remain without jobs .
this uncertainty weighs heavy on all Canadians and is the cause of so many political problems .
what action will the minister take to ensure that rather than the dump and run style of program transfer often currently employed , the department will work in partnership with aboriginal communities to ensure that programs transferred are actually going to improve the health of aboriginal people ?
QUEBEC ECONOMY
he claims that westerners had the chance for Senate reform but voted against it .
( motion agreed to )
we will long remember names like Cogger , LaSalle and Moores who faced criminal charges while members of the Tory administration .
Mr. Pierre Brien
they roll up their sleeves and get the job done .
federal and provincial ministers agreed on a three part approach to restore the financial sustainability of the CPP and make it fairer and affordable for future generations by moving to fuller funding ; by accelerating contribution rate increases now so that it will not have to exceed the 10 % for future generations ; improving the rate of return on the CPP fund by investing it prudently in a diversified portfolio of securities at arm ' s length from the government ; slowing the growth by tightening the administration of benefits and by changing the way that some are calculated .
edited HANSARD * NUMBER 4
after graduating from the University of British Columbia in law and practising for a short time in Prince Rupert , British Columbia , he moved to Ottawa and worked for 27 years in this place , serving as executive assistant to several Liberal ministers , after which he was appointed Clerk of the House of Commons for 12 years .
the bill would force the government to disclose the results of all public opinion polls to the public .
members of the House of Commons ,
the Bloc often uses the word demand specifically rather than talking about the nation as a whole and how we can all flourish , be together and share .
Mr. Robert D . Nault
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to take part in today ' s debate on the financing of political parties .
i would like to inform the Quebec separatists that there is no such thing as the rest of Canada .
as for the youth situation , I believe that the youth employment strategy announced by 12 of my colleagues and myself this past February is beginning to show some very promising results .
all the interveners seem to be of one opinion .
Mr. Speaker , I cannot understand why the hon. member is so angry .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
that is patronage and political party fund raising at their absolute worst .
i want my children and their children to have those same benefits .
Canadians want us to understand work and innovation and how changes in work , and knowledge and new technologies are impacting our economy and our relationship with it .
Mr. Chuck Cadman
this meant that some day Canadians would be forced to borrow to cover the difference or abandon the plan .
i believe all Canadians are prepared to reconcile their differences and continue building their country .
when one is elected to this House , one is supposed to be able to participate in the debates , and I am really ashamed of what has happened here today .
let me conclude by summing up our priorities for the next four years .
the Speaker :
and I may remind the hon. member that Quebecers are not the only ones responsible for the fact this debate exists .
this was followed by further comments from the hon. member for Wild Rose , the leader of the official opposition , the hon. member for Fraser Valley and the hon. member for Langley - Abbotsford as well as the hon. member for Wentworth - Burlington .
the question is where do we spend taxpayer money .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
agreed .
some hon. members :
i am sorry this displeases the hon. member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot .
supreme COURT OF CANADA
this was a very important reform , something we are taking care over to ensure that we are measuring its impact everywhere that we said we would .
government ORDERS
point of order , Madam Speaker .
Mr. Paul Bonwick
there was no consultation and this fund will not help students today who are graduating into poverty .
we have to have government programs .
accordingly , the Chair is satisfied that the amendment is in order .
the House resumed from October 7 consideration of the motion that Bill C - 2 , an act to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts , be read the second time and referred to a committee ; of the amendment ; and of the amendment to the amendment .
we can cite a few examples of the last couple of years to highlight their achievements .
is it agreed ?
not only will they have to pay for their benefits , they will also have to pay for the massive debt accumulated through the errors of previous Liberal administrations .
this legislation proposes major changes to the Canadian Wheat Board that will empower farmers as never before .
he immediately on the same afternoon called the RCMP and informed them of the allegation .
it is something which has been obvious for years .
Ms. Sarmite Bulte
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
if members want to talk about democracy , they should come to my riding and design the questions .
reinvestment , the issue of not having so much red tape , cutting out the bureaucracy , ensuring there are incentives within programs that would assist us are always on the table and those are the issues that I bring to the fore , that I share with my colleagues in the various forums and that the ministers use in their programs .
the names of members eligible for the next ballot are as follows :
youth EMPLOYMENT
i have just been contacted by a frightened Canadian in Jordan who says that all Canadians are in danger of repercussion .
if the committees of this House genuinely reflected the will of the people instead of the political agenda , most of those bills never would have gone through last year .
it is sort of ironic considering that some members of the government are the same members who sat in previous Liberal governments which helped to run up our massive debt and helped to create our deficits which occurred year upon year .
that this House condemns the attitude of the Government , which refuses to introduce in - depth reform of the legislation on the financing of federal political parties even though the existing legislation allows for a wide range of abuses .
introduction and first reading
appointment OF ASSISTANT DEPUTY CHAIRMAN
he said that Canada and Quebec should work together .
they should be happy because a reasonable decision was made to keep the centre in the region , in the riding .
* * *
the government as a whole also consulted with Canadians across the country .
Mr. Joe Jordan ( Leeds - Grenville , Lib . ) :
Mr. Ken Epp
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay :
i am not quite as pessimistic as he .
Mr. G 茅 rard Asselin
it must be very difficult for members of the Bloc right now .
audio - visual production creates over 30,000 direct jobs and 72,000 indirect jobs in Canada .
we think that there are new ideas that involve personalizing , decentralizing and localizing social service delivery that can offer more hope to people in the future .
even though we hear complaints from different parts of the country it is only because people know that the government will listen when they speak and cry out for help .
distances will matter much less ; and we will see tha differrences need not divide .
what is even more despicable is that the Liberal government has encouraged our courts to grant these lenient sentences through its conditional sentencing laws which have allowed convicted rapists to walk free .
Mr. Myron Thompson
Meech was just packaged up in a slightly different form .
every Canadian can be proud of this achievement .
i am not trying to stop the discussion , but I can see that we might get into protracted negotiation .
canada Post , which handles 3 percent of the world ' s mail , just renewed President Georges Clermont ' s obscene salary and benefits package to $ 380,000 Canadian per year , which by the way is not for public information .
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) :
they are based on proposals .
but it is very complex and vary cumbersome to implement the exclusion clause .
the Speaker :
it was said that Parliament was not his second home , but his main residence .
the fourth suggestion we made in our campaign platform , and it is still valid , is to have a targeted tax reduction .
canada POST CORPORATION
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand
its economy is in shambles .
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
the whole thing was a shell game .
with the help of funding from the government , these two companies are working to ensure that Canada remains in the forefront of a solution to this serious international problem .
the unemployment figures , meaning the number of people actively looking for work , have dropped , but entire families are now stuck on welfare because of the minister ' s new employment insurance policy , which also happens to be generating surpluses that he is using to reduce the deficit .
Spicer went out across the country and came up with dozens and dozens of recommendations , not one of which really found its way into the Charlottetown accord .
from a quiet collection of farming communities it has been transformed with suburbanization and technology .
we have to make sure our land remains natural and beautiful .
there has to be a ceiling of contributions from businesses and other organizations so that he who pays the piper indeed calls the tune .
c . D . HOWE INSTITUTE
i have received a notice of a point of order from the member for Winnipeg North Centre .
immigration
it was the member for Glengarry - Prescott - Russell in November 1987 .
we have to take stock of how the industry feels on a particular issue as opposed to simply going to the wall and in the end only hurting the industry even more .
hon. David Anderson
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
plan Bs are nice but let me share with the prime minister that as far as this party is concerned they can pursue all the plan Bs they want , compete with the opposition leader in trying to be Canada ' s undertaker , but as far as this party is concerned and as far as Canada is concerned , failure is not an option and will never be an option .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy
my riding is a diverse and precious place just like the people within it .
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua ( Vaughan - King - Aurora , Lib . ) :
therefore , you can understand my disarray when the Liberal government arrogantly claims there is no Quebec culture .
we have been given the mandate by our electors to act as stewards of their interests as we cross the threshold into a new age .
social programs have always been a priority of the government .
give us some .
i would like to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on your appointment and to thank my constituents for the trust they put in me by re - electing me as their federal representative .
we must work to strengthen and unite the country by joining in the common purpose of keeping Canada one of the best places in the world in which to live .
allotted DAY - Federal Party Financing
No.
they are concerned about its features , about its security .
similarly it must follow that for every billion dollars removed from our economy 45,000 jobs may well disappear .
education and training are key to this new economy and job opportunities '' .
each day that passes without a full public inquiry into Ipperwash darkens the stain of the blood spilled at that tragic event .
adjournment PROCEEDINGS
since citizens initiative and referendum power was introduced not a single council member or mayor has been voted out of office because the constituents have been able to concentrate on the issues and the council and mayor carried out the wishes of the constituents .
i hope the RCMP will be able to do its work freely and to arrive at some conclusions that will be extremely important and that will certainly implicate people who are very close to the government .
therefore , it is not going to be income tested .
there is urgent need for this type of legislation in Canada .
i want to thank all the parties in this House that will join with the Quebec National Assembly to permit , and this is the core of the issue , the implementation of a resolution passed by the only francophone parliament , the only one controlled by a majority of Quebeckers , the National Assembly , of course .
we don ' t want any handouts but we can ' t afford that $ 700 more '' .
we promised to create conditions favourable for private sector job creation and to invest for immediate jobs in growth , in infrastructure , trade , youth employment , labour market training , payroll tax deduction , tourism , rural Canada and small business .
Mr. Bill Blaikie
i am also very proud to be part of a government that recognizes there is such a thing as child poverty , especially in working low income families .
the Speaker :
it is a balanced approach .
he saw Parliament Hill as a welcome place for those who sought to learn about it and who came to pay their respects .
agreed .
they see new ways of communicating with others throughout the entire world as well as right next door , and new ways of improving their community and enriching their lives .
what will this bill do with regard to those current beneficiaries ?
we have yet to find out the impact of the changes to seniors benefits for Canada ' s middle class .
the government is intent on forging ahead despite the cries of the vast majority of producers that it simply does not address their needs .
i applaud the government for having the wisdom to invest in knowledge and creativity .
is the member saying that he is against what we have done to protect and secure a dignified and secure retirement for seniors through our agreement with the provinces on the Canada pension plan ?
Mr. Speaker , in 1982 Canada was one of the first nations to sign the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .
* * *
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Minister of Human Resources Development said not only that the Soci 茅 t 茅 qu 茅 b 茅 coise du d 茅 veloppement de la main - d ' oeuvre had lists of people waiting for grants , but that the political minister responsible for the region was aware of the contents of this list .
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron ( Verch 猫 res , BQ ) :
some people cast their ballot on the basis of the MP who was running .
Mr. David Iftody ( Provencher , Lib . ) :
there were many messages sent in the campaign .
i talked the other day in an S . O . 31 of an accountable senator .
i welcome a lot of the remarks which she made today and I would like to ask her one question .
Mr. Speaker , the Government of Quebec has repeatedly demonstrated the validity of its demand for $ 2 billion as compensation for harmonizing the GST .
Mr. Preston Manning
when she talks about the francophonie , I wish the member for Rimouski - Mitis would include francophones outside Quebec as well as those in Quebec in Canada ' s French - speaking community .
* * *
they took great offence at Lucien Bouchard ' s comments saying that the rest of Canada is not a nation , not a people .
Mr. Speaker , as an individual member I would like to refer the member opposite to some of my efforts with respect to bringing accountability to charitable organizations which , in a sense , are government organizations in the sense that they receive taxpayer dollars .
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) :
therefore we need our leaders to be competent , to be able to get Canadians to pull together and then wisely administer .
Mr. Ghislain Fournier ( Manicouagan , BQ ) :
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I was rather taken by the hon. minister ' s comments about the revenue departments of the provinces and the federal government working together .
the farmers themselves are sitting on the board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board .
it is a high priority bill that is being introduced right after the election .
another program he wants to see eliminated ?
for over a week now , members of each of the opposition parties , particularly the Bloc Quebecois , have been trying to find out about this transitional fund scandal in the last election .
first of all , it must be made perfectly clear that the Canadian Wheat Board we are today trying to modernize , to update for the year 2000 and beyond , affects the grain producers of Quebec only very slightly .
Mr. Speaker , I too wish to congratulate you on your appointment as acting speaker of the House .
they recognize that it is a Canadian problem and that they will have to respect the views of the Canadian government .
government ORDERS
how soon will the wait be over for the thousands of Canadians who need an answer now ?
that is the Liberal philosophy .
hon. Anne McLellan
while there are various legal aspects of this process that must be considered , I would like the committee to consider this one .
it may be due to the fact that we keep hearing all the negativism .
our health care system is viewed by many as the best in the world .
an hon. member :
the government has signalled no intention to have it debated in the House or to have an appropriate public consultation process .
during the period of consultation , funding to the Health Protection Branch will be maintained , until the outcome of the analysis is known .
if the hon. member has a grievance he should pursue it in my view with the minister .
to be entirely honest , I did not think I read the throne speech correctly .
as move toward the next millennium both within Canada and globally we are really in a battle of democracy versus the market .
the next time members opposite speak to their children or grandchildren , or their neighbour ' s children , tell them what is being done to their future , how they are being shackled for the rest of their working lives with the cost of this and previous Liberal government mistakes , mistakes that the previous Liberal speaker in this debate even admitted were well known in the 1960 s .
since the government has done little in the past to quell the illegal use of Canadian passports , what concrete steps will it take to ensure that Canadian passports will not be used illegally in this manner in the future ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
we believe that if governments create the conditions that offer opportunity and security in the economy , then prosperity will alleviate many of the social concerns we are struggling to deal with here in this place .
whether it accomplishes that is another question .
British Columbians , indeed all Canadians , are offended at the federal government ' s weak stance in this dispute .
that was not a long time ago , just back in 1980 .
it has taken the budget making process out of the back rooms and into the public fora and into Parliament and has put it into the hands of members of Parliament .
i know one is not allowed to say an individual in the House committed a cowardly act .
my question is for the Minister of Justice .
it is just one example of our agenda .
but we will never be hostage to demands that diminish or deny to each and every Canadian the benefits of his or her citizenship and our nationhood , our existence as an independent nation recognized by the UN .
the hon. member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough .
is the member proud that the government is announcing $ 850 million for young people , $ 250 million of which was already provided for in the last budget , while the remaining $ 600 had been promised in 1993 for a national child care program that never saw the light of day ?
the Speaker :
let me tell members about a special family .
hon. Charles Caccia
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
it is time we begin to take some steps that all provinces across the country are asking for .
two , compelling legal evidence , preferably a supreme court ruling , establishing that both the proposed approach to amending the Constitution and the constitutional amendment itself conform to the rule of law .
this is a fabrication by the hon. member .
the average family today has real problems .
the Bloc is pontificating today .
Monday , September 22 , 1997
during this term of office , I will personally and with pride promote Quebec ' s interests within the Liberal Party of Canada and campaign tirelessly for the French fact in this country .
it was in a different Parliament .
( motions deemed adopted and bill read the first time )
by the year 2000 it will take some action .
Mr. Peter Adams
we declare who they are and the public has a right to know .
the second test we propose , and this is not something that should have to be said in a parliament or legislature , but it does have to be said and that is that the proposed amendment be subjected to the test of the rule of law .
they do not make transactions on their laptop computers or their cellphones .
my colleague , the member for Prince George - Peace River , and other Reform members , will discuss the defects of the bill in detail and will present some real reform alternatives .
we have to ask what does it mean .
the government has no intention to participate in any way in an act which would constitute the contempt of this House .
everyone loses .
Mr. Speaker , I listened with great interest to the speech by my colleague for Vancouver East and I agree with her almost 100 percent .
the prime minister could be whistling " Pennies from Heaven '' .
this seems strange .
these blithe cuts in transfers to the provinces , as well as departmental budgets , the latter having lost half a billion for R & D , have been detrimental to the activities of all the country ' s research laboratories , centres and agencies .
what does she plan to do to protect these women ?
sometimes , that foresight was lacking or not so sharp .
i hope my colleague does not want that program eliminated as well .
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) :
i am saying to the government today to make sure that consultations continue .
we will compliment the wise government policy , criticize the bad and propose constructive alternatives .
government ORDERS
in closing , there are improvements within the existing Bill C - 4 over previous legislation on the Canadian Wheat Board .
he represented for many years the people of South Shore and I owe him a debt of gratitude .
people looking after that corporation certainly have a responsibility to have the expertise to be brought forward to make certain that those issues are understood and understood well .
in 1994 the National Crime Prevention Council was established as part of the national strategy on community safety and crime prevention .
as he is well aware , barely 4 percent of our electorate trusts politicians and many of that number are members of our own immediate families or friends of ours .
what excited me is the fact that a decision was made in Quebec 32 years ago to develop a major financial tool , the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement , not only to provide good return on the investments of workers , but also to promote the development of the Quebec nation .
* * *
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
i also note that one of probably twenty changes that the minister was bragging about a while ago is the deletion of the term " employees '' .
i am also concerned that the government is not using the processes the minister talked about to settle disputes .
building up a larger fund , fuller funding and earning a higher rate of return through investment in the market will help pay for the rapidly growing cost that will occur once baby boomers begin to retire .
Canadians have expectations from government but they also have needs .
yeas
rights of the Child

part of our role here should be to act as legislators .
Mr. Speaker , as you know , this afternoon in the House the member for Calgary Southwest of the Reform Party expressed the point of view that millionaires were overtaxed in this country .
where is the recognition in the speech from the throne that many government initiated social programs , no matter how well meaning they would be , are simply no longer affordable , no longer workable and no longer even supported by the clients that they were intended to serve .
Mr. Speaker , I ask that all questions be allowed to stand .
one of our areas of work was trying to improve relations between aboriginal people and oil companies .
in responding to this question , can he tell us whether he will in fact vote in favour of the amendment we are proposing ?
backbench Liberal MPs I believe if they were not so muzzled by the party discipline in the Liberal Party would be crying out along with us for those types of reforms so that they can really represent the interests of their constituents and not worry that the big broad axe is going to fall on their necks and they are going to be publicly disciplined and chastised by their leadership and perhaps even ultimately thrown out of their party .
Canadian military personnel led rescue and relief efforts working alongside civilian volunteers in difficult and dangerous conditions .
the Speaker :
they found new ways to interfere .
it is a party that is basically anti - government .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
Mr. Speaker , any organization as I said before that is funded by multiculturalism programs is insured .
therefore there would be no evidence of any decisions taken in camera by a committee on an issue because the minutes would have been destroyed .
in this way we would have some assurances that in the long term the accumulated surpluses would be invested in a wise manner .
how about starting with the hon. members pension plan ?
two out of three farmers voted in favour of wheat board marketing .
who will pay for this ?
this debate has not arisen for no reason .
if I hire a man and he steals my pick - up truck and I call the police and they arrest him and put him in jail , will I have to pay the fine ?
in his reply Mr. Crouse talked about the people back home in the riding .
Mr. Speaker , when the Liberal government introduced TAGS four years ago it promised to restructure the Atlantic fishing industry .
that is certainly my advice .
under the bill , there is a plan to increase this to 3.8 years which would be about $ 126 billion .
Mr. Andr 茅 Harvey
give me 24 hours and I could fill that time with the specifics we have suggested .
statements BY MEMBERS
Mr. Speaker , this incident occurred almost a week ago .
this strategy calls for a high quality , low cost information network that will give Canadians access to employment information , education , health care , entertainment , investment and wealth creating opportunities in the technology sector .
Mr. Speaker , it has been an interesting morning and afternoon discussing Bill C - 4 , an act regarding the Canadian Wheat Board .
again , I raise the question of whose money is this ?
this Liberal plan was created in 1966 .
some of the most urgent health problems today are found in Aboriginal communities .
we also offered during the election a workable plan for enhancing the unity of our country and securing our future .
the result is that we can now make strategic investments for our children , our young people , our health , and our communities , as well as for the sector of knowledge and creativity .
the consultation with Albertans did not lead to the results and direction that he says they did .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
the government and the dairy industry are already putting a strategy together to deal with the section 301 challenge that the United States has put on a track toward the WTO .
however , the one thing that usually flies in the face of anything that happens through developments like this is that they never really consult the people that they purport to serve .
Canadians deserve more than government by patronage and appointment .
these initiatives are tied together by a common thread .
i represent the riding of Scarborough East which is bounded on the east by the largest urban wilderness park in Canada , the Rouge River Park , and on the south by the Scarborough bluffs which rise from the shores of Lake Ontario .
there are too few dollars for too many people .
the social security review was good and much will come from it .
people really want us to discuss the issue of political party contributions .
given the allegations and the fabrications we have heard , would I be wrong in believing there is something in the wind ?
we will build on the National Research Council ' s highly respected industrial research assistance program , winner of the prestigious Ernest C . Manning award , to help small and medium size businesses to develop and commercialize new technologies .
i accept the hon. member ' s statement just as I accept the minister ' s explanation of the events .
speech FROM THE THRONE
hon. Lucienne Robillard
many OECD countries are also making changes so that their pension systems are more sustainable .
this was a good deal that reflected a negotiated compromise .
privilege
it seems to me this is perfectly clear .
bill C - 205 .
one of the reasons I am happy to speak on Bill C - 4 is because the Canadian Wheat Board ' s home is in my city , the city of Winnipeg .
why they even preened about increasing the size of the bureaucracy by 3,000 temporary bureaucrats with $ 90 million of taxpayer money .
Mr. Speaker , I listened with considerable interest to the new member for Madawaska - Restigouche who , I might say , speaks an exemplary French .
other issues are up for review .
this would be an effective way to fight poverty , particularly child poverty .
the Speaker :
as a courtesy to the Liberal members who have this big government , high spending , high taxation mentality , I would like to caution and advise them that they may wish to cover their ears .
we saw the effect which changes to the EI had on the citizens of Atlantic Canada .
many of my friends on social assistance do not know what it is to have gifts under the tree at Christmastime .
just to digress for a moment , I noted during the brief remarks of the hon. minister of agriculture a moment ago he referred to some 20 amendments the agriculture committee had made that were ultimately incorporated into the bill before the House today , Bill C - 4 .
still in that same part of the speech , I am pleased to see that the government decided to develop alternatives to imprisonment for non - violent , low - risk offenders .
in particular he shows how the government has squandered $ 3.5 billion on the TAGS program .
somehow the private sector is by definition more effective and more efficient .
we shall work together so that Canada will continue to be the number one nation in the world in which to live .
CPP contributions are not a tax .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye
i want to spend a good deal of time on this .
Mr. Denis Coderre
we can pin our hopes on the fact that Canada is a country Quebecers want to keep .
senator Carney ' s statements are part of a far broader movement .
parental love , family support and strong communities are antidotes to poverty ' s sting but they are not enough .
it is the fact that all the members of the Senate have been appointed by the prime minister of the day that causes Reformers such grief in dealing with the upper Chamber .
the Speaker :
that is a shame because that is removing the vital foundation under which this country operates which is to look after the seniors of this land .
for five months through the election campaign , through the summer and the opening of Parliament , Sharon valiantly struggled to perform two duties , to her constituents and to the House , and her duty to her husband who needs her more than he has ever needed her before .
meanwhile , three provinces are significantly under - represented in this House and they average 105,366 people per MP .
we recognize that the old model of social assistance , a tool of dependency , is not good enough .
the more tourism there is , the more service jobs and jobs in tourism there will be .
Mr. Speaker , Mr. Bouchard has said that he will not take part in any public consultation process .
as the prime minister said , and he proposed a very clear and concrete answer , one - half of the surplus should go to a combination of reducing taxes and national debt .
then this government tabled a bill to replace the existing Canadian Environmental Protection Act .
it is a government able to exercise its obligations '' .
blackmailing a firm into contributing money to a political party in exchange for a grant is unacceptable .
i am very disappointed .
it fails to try to harness that substance to the national interest and thus misses a golden opportunity at the end of the 20 th century to harness energy and vigour to the task of uniting our country and making our economy strong .
i find it despicable to come up with these allegations , to continually act like Tartuffe , when we all know that the Canadian system is probably one of the best in the world .
that is positive , concrete action , not empty promises .
i want to assure them that I will support any initiative to prevent young people from committing suicide .
this member condemned the bill because it took $ 11 billion out of the economy over six years .
the fact that it does not touch existing seniors ' packages is also helpful .
Mr. John Richardson ( Perth - Middlesex , Lib . ) :
i did not hear it .
it says nothing to me and enables them to improvise , as they always have .
in the words Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier :
they look at business dollars as savvy executives .
Mr. Speaker , if I understand the member ' s question , he is concerned about the accountability of that plan .
that is why we are willing to consider transportation issues .
in my constituency of Oakville I am receiving letters of concern about our negotiations toward a multilateral agreement on investment .
Ms. Nancy Karetak - Lindell :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate you on your appointment .
routine PROCEEDINGS
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
our approach is the opposite of the Reform Party ' s .
at Hastings and Nanaimo we experience the urban flavour of thriving small businesses that serve the community .
i acknowledge that everything which has been said about him is true .
is he encouraging them all to move to Alberta ?
it is not normal to make cuts based on a budget plan tabled by the finance minister in 1996 , to slash , year after year on a cumulative basis , the budget for social programs by some $ 42 billion , and to think this will have no impact on child poverty .
it was nice to have somebody to assist me in preparing my private member ' s bills and my questions .
my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs .
they do not know if they will have a job tomorrow .
Ms. Marlene Catterall ( Ottawa West - Nepean , Lib . ) :
i do not know what the member means by the path of freedom .
this is so typical of Liberal promises .
the Speech from the Throne threatens this consensus and risks all that has been achieved .
the option of eliminating the benefit was rejected .
revelations are made about something that is never made public .
Mr. Speaker , four years ago Atlantic fishermen were told that TAGS would help lead them to a new life .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the people endorsed our programs .
i would like to thank the Prime Minister and the minister of sport , as well as my leader , Mr. Jean Charest , for being a part of that -
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
he took this honour very seriously .
i am flattered .
we have here another Liberal government ploy : do everything possible to discredit the Government of Quebec , but Quebeckers are proud and will continue to support Quebec ' s sovereignty proposal .
it is unbelievable that the minister responsible for the RCMP is practically the only member of the Liberal cabinet unaware of the events .
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
where is the bill that starts to decentralize and ultimately do away with the department of Indian affairs and transfers functions and funding to local aboriginal governments ?
Ms. Jocelyne Bujold - Girard ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ :
science and technology are at the core of a modern country ' s prosperity .
the Speaker :
hon. Jean J . Charest :
the decision to cancel this purchase was not made on sound judgment as part of an overall strategy for Canada ' s military .
i want to give thanks to our Conservative member for Richmond - Arthabaska for his hard and diligent work in bringing this matter to the forefront .
in the throne speech there seemed to be some recognition of the need to allow Canadians to participate more fully in a global information age .
the legislation that we are debating , Bill C - 2 , will enact the joint federal - provincial agreement reached last February to change the Canada pension plan , or CPP as it is known .
it is in that way that we will create the jobs .
the Conservatives were very guilty of these practices in the past .
because of the shrouded responses we are receiving , the issue has gone far afield .
we have been able to make that investment because of the fiscal progress that we have made in this country .
i want to close this speech by extending an invitation to those members of this House and those Canadians from across the country who have not yet had the privilege to see Nunavut to come and visit us .
it is not going to work .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
this is no mean feat , considering it is the parliamentarians ' role to debate , to challenge ideas , sometimes to reach a consensus .
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) :
the best way to fight crime is to engage communities across Canada in crime prevention at the community level and to attack the root causes of crime .
an hon. member :
finding work these days remains a challenge for young Canadians .
but it was the Government of Canada that gave national leadership to assure that the creativity of our individual provinces was shared by all Canadians .
unfortunately , its efforts are directed more at the consequences of the problem than at the problem itself .
it is imperative that members of Parliament have the confidence to perform their duties with accurate information which is not deliberately misleading or deliberately withheld from them .
i suggest respectfully that our three tests are broader and deeper than those proposed by the government .
Mrs. Francine Lalonde :
he is saying he acknowledges that the majority of people in Newfoundland agree that a constitutional change must be brought forward to change the school system in Newfoundland , but he is prepared yet again to ignore the people because he knows better .
given the tolerant nature of the people of Newfoundland and of people across the country , I find that to be a little disappointing , to say the least .
in that context , I am puzzled by the priorities of a government which , in its Speech from the Throne , seemed to give as much importance to celebrating the coming of the next millennium as to the challenge of global warming that faces humanity .
the Speaker :
what I find most upsetting in this speech is that the sovereignist movement ' s proposal is misrepresented by the excessive repetition of the word " partnership " when what is meant is interference , overlap and costly duplication .
the recipient , of course , must return the favour .
that was in 1950 .
we had the very severe flood in the Saguenay region and we had the very different but equally severe inundation of southern Manitoba .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the finance minister is telling us that it is just too bad about the 1.4 million people who still do not have jobs .
the minister argues that these arrangements would allow the board to adapt more quickly to market developments especially when the board needs a certain grain quickly and supplies are not immediately forthcoming .
miss Deborah Grey :
however , in Canada we have heard nothing from the Prime Minister yet alone the environment minister , despite the fact that the economic and environmental implications regarding this treaty are substantial .
i want to caution the member to please choose his words judiciously .
the Minister of Finance has an odd sense of fairness .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
this belief is founded on an understanding of the treaty relationship , this very sacred relationship that the crown has with First Nations .
question .
i hope the government will listen .
third producers themselves must vote in favour of the addition .
they do not go into the government ' s revenues to be spent '' .
it goes on and on .
i think that elected representatives as a whole and the people of Quebec and Canada want above all for decisions on legislation to be the responsibility of the House of Commons and that this be the only way to proceed .
helicopters
today there is in Canada once again a wonderful sense of a country moving , of a country that matters , of a country that dreams again .
there are many things .
i am pleased to be here with a group of very progressive New Democrats who on a daily base in the House will remind the government how it has been cruel and continues to be cruel to many Canadians .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye
it contains only one paragraph recognizing the work of the premiers in Calgary on September 14 .
where I come from , in my country of Quebec , we call that provocation .
to me , this is a tool that can be equally used by labour or by management .
there were 75 members of Parliament from Quebec in this House at that time .
i am sure she will represent her riding with a passion unparalleled .
among those responsibilities which you discharge so will , is turning off the microphones when they are meant to be off .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
i would like the member to explain and expand on the difference between the Reform approach to tax fairness versus the typical NDP approach .
in addition , my colleague from Fraser Valley , the official opposition whip , asked me to serve as his deputy .
it was a condition of his parole that he return to his native England and not return to Canada until at least the expiration of his sentence in 2003 .
surely he does not want to do away with these programs for our young people , push them aside , put them out of existence ?
the prime minister will know that in the cabinet room in which he convenes his cabinet , as he sits down there is something written on the wall in front of him .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to know , inquiring Canadians across this country would like to know , what the minister responsible for consumer affairs plans to do to protect Canadian consumers from the kind of unscrupulous business practices in long term vehicle leasing that was reported in today ' s and yesterday ' s media .
over that time he earned the reputation of being a true parliamentarian .
what I hear from the party of the left is to spend more .
through this fund process the possibility is there for lower interest rates and also we have created the availability of more debt and equity capital for small businesses which will create jobs .
goods AND SERVICES TAX
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain ( Guelph - Wellington , Lib . ) :
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
i wish also to thank the many volunteers who supported our campaign and whose friendship I cherish very much .
in the 1980 s the vision was through the eyes of the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney .
this was the last Remembrance Day before the onset of his illness .
opening OF SESSION
by moving now , premiums will not have to exceed 9.9 percent .
many visitors , future residents and investors became acquainted with our community through tourism .
it amuses the members opposite as much as it thrilled my supporters on the night of the election .
what is at the end of the arm ' s length relationship with the provinces , for instance with health care ?
government Orders
* * *
i appreciate that the member ' s question is otherwise a good one .
* * *
it is not a one - way street with one guy holding the money .
let us not forget how the Liberals got there .
we believe that the Canada pension plan has worked well until recently .
i would like to thank those people who spent so much time , effort and shoe leather getting me elected .
however by 2030 an employee would be paying $ 565 less a year than if we had not acted now .
there is a real need for this national discourse .
i want to make it known that I support the recent initiatives of the federal government and the provincial and territorial leaders .
i would like to speak to my constituents and to Canadians about the Canada pension plan .
when I surveyed the farmers in my area , I had no vested interest in one side of the question or the other .
at second reading , the Bloc Quebecois supports most of the bill before us and does so for several reasons .
i want to thank you , my colleagues , for your vote of confidence today .
immediately upon graduating from McGill University , Mr. Fraser joined the Canadian army , serving until the end of World War II.
* * *
resumption of debate on Address in Reply
all you have to do is work with the provinces -
Mr. Speaker , for the time being , allegations are all we have .
second , the Canadian Grain Commission must approve an identity preservation system to protect quality standards .
the government and its friends in all the other parties want to raise the CPP payroll tax to 10 % to give Canadians an enormously generous pension of $ 8,800 a year .
this is further evidence that Canada is working to ensure the success of all Quebecers .
we will introduce a bill that will bring up to $ 12.5 billion the guaranteed annual cash payments to provinces and territories within the framework of the Canada health and social transfer .
it has been blessed with some financial measures which any government could have fared better with than what it has .
hon. Sergio Marchi
they can keep talking all they want , but I may be the first member of this House to talk about the campaign preceding the June 2 election .
this bill does put forward a very good balance .
mineral exploration is absolutely critical to the replenishment of the reserves .
i believe this is responsible .
i criticized his budget policy because I consider it savage .
fuller funding of the CPP means that the fund will grow substantially from about two years of benefits to about four or five over the next two decades .
Mr. Yvan Loubier
my question for the Prime Minister is , besides calling in the RCMP , what is he going to do to remove the clouds of corruption that are surrounding his government ?
when will the prime minister ask the Israeli prime minister for a formal apology over this unfortunate incident ?
the purpose of this bill is not to reform the plan at the expense of the younger generations , but rather to reduce intergenerational inequity by ensuring that everyone pays his or her fair share .
i do not rail against hard times alone .
it is high time that the separatists of Lucien Bouchard started working for the welfare of all Quebecers .
we will continue to examine the way in which people are receiving retirement income and employment insurance benefits .
they are a lot worse than the word I just used .
and we ' re snapping at your heels !
the coal mine in Cheviot will be developed because the resources were depleted in Luscar .
when we first started as a government in 1993 our priorities were set by the fact that at that time we faced a $ 42 billion deficit .
i can tell hon. members opposite that there are many people in my riding who are living on disability payments .
it is about achieving together what we could not possibly do alone .
the Government will
the privilege which we in this country have is to live in the greatest nation on earth .
but there was not a single word about redressing these inequities .
it has to be cleaned up .
the government is washing its hands by handing the airports over to this body , because it refers any taxpayer claims to it .
i think this approach that we have taken in the Speech from the Throne is a serious approach .
why not go after poverty with a vengeance , improve the employment insurance plan and reverse all the cuts that were made ?
Mr. Speaker , it looks like FedEx is the courier of choice at Revenue Canada .
is Reform afraid that the Canadian people will see how the Reform plan will leave the poor and the middle class unattended ?
Mr. Pierre Brien :
while some members in this House prefer to talk about fights for the right , there are some of us who prefer to simply work hard for what is right .
there does not exist a government wide summary of the fees being charged , the revenues raised and the authorities under which they are established '' .
the Speaker received a letter from the hon. member expressing his intention to raise this matter .
i was shocked to hear the words of the leader of the party opposite .
it speaks of trade .
just recently I was an election observer in Bosnia .
the Reform is saying this is not true .
however , as the minister has said , the proposed changes do not run counter to the interests of the anglophone community .
only one of the four opposition parties , I believe it was the Bloc Quebecois , indicated a definite number of speakers that it wanted to put up .
the Deputy Speaker :
he was a good friend of Bill Bennett , that upstanding fundraiser who has been before the courts for the last 15 years .
as such , Mr. Svend Robinson , I have to name you for disregarding the authority of the Chair .
we can all contribute to improving our own chances for wellness and reduce the future cost for medicare by making the right choices now .
perhaps it is , from that particular perspective , the code word for a political agenda .
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the opportunity to speak to this question .
Mr. Speaker , I am proud to say that yes he was the father of the present leader of the official opposition .
we need people in the communities who try to assist these people .
it is about time we got some balance into this society of ours .
Clair for their support in the June election .
i will conclude with one last quote from Mr. Johnson , again at a federal - provincial constitutional conference , in 1968 : " The Constitution should not have as its sole purpose to federate territories , but also to associate in equality two linguistic and cultural communities , two founding peoples , two societies , two nations , in the sociological meaning of the term '' .
Mr. Bryon Wilfert ( Oak Ridges , Lib . ) :
we will do so by increasing the child tax benefit and we will work in co - operation with the provinces as they invest in services for children .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
the test of democratic consent is the first principle we feel should be applied , under the circumstances .
we know that is a similar policy to the Conservative Party as the member has just outlined .
i am being asked to talk about something new .
we applaud the government ' s desire to end child poverty .
first , I know that you have a piece of paper which I would ask you not to use as a prop .
oh , oh .
youth STRATEGY
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) :
they understood that they would have to pay the $ 975 landing fee , but what they did not understand , and for which I fought with them , is that the fee must be paid at the time of landing and not before .
interest payments on the debt have grown exponentially .
what can Atlantic Canadians expect from the Prime Minister and his government after May 1998 ?
this is why a public debate is so important .
anyone who is just a little bit logical has to conclude that what the government is proposing , in the face of the poll that I have just mentioned and after 27 years of fiscal irresponsibility , is the return to chequebook politics .
hear , hear .
the fix is in .
although we can measure certain amounts of lost markets , we cannot measure the entire impact on the economy .
the Speech from the Throne has done just that .
what we really need is real debate in this House and for the decisions to be made here .
the Minister of Finance who took the Conservative government to task for its restrictive Bank of Canada policy is now piling on even more restrictions .
we inherited a deficit from the Conservatives .
they hurt because I am really shaking them up today .
it is regrettable that such things are being said in Quebec .
has it examined payroll taxes ?
clearly reducing taxes , yes , I think all Canadians would like to see taxes reduced .
these thousand crosses are symbols of the social apartheid in our culture , the segregation of those who deserve to live and those who are abandoned to die '' .
bill C - 220
i think she indicated she would continue to attack the employment situation .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
i think there are many reasons to be concerned about what we know so far .
revenue CANADA
Mr. Speaker , we shall continue for the rest of today and tomorrow the conclusion of the address debate .
those are the kinds of sentiments I am hearing from Canadians instead of the superficial partisan political rhetoric that we just heard from the member opposite .
i am really confused as to exactly what the minister means by that .
its objective is clearly to promote Canada ' s partition .
the Speaker :
for a Tory to blame the Liberals for the unemployment insurance premiums is like a mosquito blaming the doctor for malaria .
as the deputy health critic for the Reform Party , I and the rest of the members of the Reform Party will hold the government and the minister accountable for actions in this matter .
i come back to three things in respect of vision for the country , honesty , competence and leadership .
hon. Jean J . Charest
we gave our young service men and women in 1914 and again in 1939 when they served in all facets of the military and merchant marine .
it was interesting to listen to the member .
under Bill C - 4 the Canadian Wheat Board would be governed by a board of directors with a majority of its members elected by farmers and accountable to them .
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) :
they are an important aspect of this country I remind the hon. member .
that strong voice just was not there .
in the long run by reducing the debt and the debt servicing costs we can reduce taxes for all Canadians .
their pensions will remain indexed .
it is higher than anyone in the House would like to see it .
we pledge today to honour Stanley ' s memory by fighting any further erosion of pension protection for our seniors .
i do not think one has to go too far to understand how we wound up in a situation where the initiative of this government and of several provincial governments who agreed to this formula came about .
Mr. Alex Shepherd
the Liberals thought it prudent to give the multibillion dollar company American Express $ 17,000 .
anyone currently receiving Canada pension plan benefits will not see these benefits affected in any way .
this clause allows for the extensions of part III or part IV or both to grains not currently covered by the Canadian Wheat Board Act .
there are steps that we can and will take to lead the efforts by all governments .
Mr. Speaker , considering that such allegations were made , did the Prime Minister himself or any of his ministers intervene to ensure that the individual or individuals in question were not involved with them in the process of awarding grants ?
we are also having an independent consultant work with that public participation group to this end .
it was not overwhelmingly defeated by everyone outside Quebec .
there seems to be a great gap between the mentality and the inside language and the inside operations of the justice system and where they are at and where the public is act .
Mr. Myron Thompson :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on behalf of the Reform Party of Canada to pay tribute to a beloved servant of the House of Commons .
that organization had failed to file its papers with Victoria for three years in a row .
in 1992 in the face of the indifference our predecessors showed toward youth issues , our party established a Senate - Commons committee on youth .
i would ask the hon. member for Sault Ste. Marie for a brief reply .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question .
bill C - 226 .
hopefully she will be interested in the pursuit of what is right for Canadians rather than what is right for the Liberal Party .
while it is important and necessary to ensure immigrants are welcomed and integrated into the Quebec community , it seems that bettering the education of Canada ' s young people might be a more important first objective for a government serious about education , not just talking about taking Quebec out of Canada .
an hon. member :
bill C - 4 fulfils that undertaking .
what did Guy Saint - Julien receive during the 1988 election ?
Mr. Jim Gouk
we have some pretty serious questions here .
a country that has decided to invest in its children is a country confident of its future .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
members will know that the member for Port Moody - Coquitlam was a tireless advocate for and defender of the Canadian family both within our caucus and without .
everything is being questioned with the almost acknowledged aim of frightening Quebecers and with the obvious aim of saying , " You will never do it '' .
we will wait for the investigation .
is the hon. member prepared to take such a step , since employment appears to be something she considers important ?
what is even more important is that the public gets a kick at the cat at the front end because if they do not they are going to reject whatever package we come up with no matter how well it is conceived .
our market is too small .
together they came , cared , reached out and helped .
i wish to inform the House that in accordance with the presentation made by the government , pursuant to Standing Order 55 ( 1 ) , I have caused to be published a special Order Paper giving notice of two government motions .
Mr. Speaker , this is the first opportunity I have had to speak since the election .
the member for Wild Rose claims that the released confidential financial information is permitted if written consent is received .
i have a question for her .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom
we have all read the papers and watched the news so let me take this opportunity to address some of these erroneous headlines and some erroneous statements by some hon. members , some that I heard a few moments ago .
ideally , women should get a little more to make up for what they lost .
in this era of free trade , Canadians would be foolish to allow their government to impose decisions upon them that would lessen the potential benefits of trade with the U.S.
Mr. Speaker , on Wednesday , the hon. member for Rimouski - Mitis deemed it necessary to explain , in the House , her disparaging remarks concerning French Canadians .
this is the background , the content and the import of the matter to be placed before the proposed special joint committee of the House of Commons and the Senate .
Mr. Speaker , whenever responsibility for an aboriginal community is turned over to a First Nation , it is done on the basis that that community will not only have responsibility for administering the program , but for accounting for it as well .
i apologize for not mincing any words , but his leadership is worn out .
in this system of super RRSPs , the government will have to guarantee an acceptable base income at the time of retirement , in the form of either a minimum pension or a separate assistance plan .
this is unacceptable to Canadians , especially to young Canadians .
that is why Canadians can look forward with great hope to the future .
canada ' s Minister of Foreign Affairs even threatened diplomatic retaliation .
procedure and House Affairs
the hon. member for Calgary Southeast
the federal government when meeting with energy and environment ministers from the provinces in the coming weeks will discuss the recent report and find out how we can indeed reduce the emissions in order to protect our industries and health in Canada .
to this end , yesterday , the Bank of Canada took its foot off the gas every so slightly so it would not have to hit the brakes too hard down the road .
* * *
* * *
i am referring in particular to his statement that Quebec is part of the so - called Canadian heritage .
i was told a small group of separatists wanted to break up a country which on more than one occasion has been recognized as the best country in the world to live in .
there were no consultations on that , but it was very committed to ensuring that we got the $ 2 coin with the polar bear .
as I outlined , the best way to ensure we never repeat the mistakes of the past is to provide Canadians with guarantees , guarantees in the forms of balanced budget legislation and targets and benchmarks for the fiscal dividend and debt reduction .
on investing in quality health care and good health , our health care system has become a vital part of our national fabric , providing the security that represents both a social and an economic benefit .
hon. Andy Scott :
i was very aware of the congratulations he directed to the company in his riding , when it decided to do business in Hull .
the government should give us some credit .
we will be promoting health and new initiatives to address tuberculosis and diabetes in aboriginal communities .
public CONSULTATION
that is a substantial fund for this country .
Mr. Bill Blaikie
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is wrong .
within six years I believe the government will admit it was wrong .
is he laying the groundwork for the third pillar of the Reform Party , which is youth separation ?
no they are not .
Mr. Speaker , seven of nine provinces have yet to have a single word in French at their Internet site .
perhaps we can have some good debate at that time on some of these issues .
we then would ask the Chair to put the question at 2.30 p.m. rather than at 2.15 p.m.
perhaps the fault lies with the Conservative leader , the leader of her own party who , bereft of ideas for Canada , clings desperately to the distinct society clause as a solution to national unity .
my question for the hon. member is specifically , what does the Reform have in mind .
i am not making these accusations , I am asking questions .
to ensure independence of the board , the legislation prohibits government employees from serving as directors and it requires that the board include a core of directors with financial investment expertise .
in Quebec it is proposed that two school systems change dramatically to create two new school systems .
it is therefore not surprising that this society has questioned on many occasions the appropriateness of a system established on a denominational basis .
that is just the way it is .
those who think that Reform is simply a protest party or that the new political energy in the west is simply protest are 15 years behind the times .
introduction and first reading
never did they speak to the ability to market better .
in this mandate , however , I think that it would be a good idea for him to make the tax system fairer for lower income classes and not just for his millionaire and billionaire friends and those of the Liberal Party of Canada .
another issue is pilotage charges .
that is why we are debating it here on the floor of the House of Commons .
the health care system in this country is threatened .
there is no question there will be a lot of input and influence on this aspect of the plan .
as well , Canada needs to develop its symbols of nationhood .
Mr. Speaker , there can be no doubt that the Canadian economy is back on track .
in conclusion , the effect of the new policy I have outlined will be to treat the CPP as a true pension plan .
i know some of this was created by the previous government , but we cannot always blame it for everything .
so , I would appreciate it if the hon. member for Berthier - Montcalm could elaborate on these issues .
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Brossard - La Prairie , Lib . ) :
we will hear comments any day now - we should be hearing them in question period today - that the government has decided the Cadillac helicopter purchase has been changed into a Chevrolet and now we can afford it .
they will carry a very heavy fiduciary responsibility .
routine PROCEEDINGS
it will take a lot of dollars out of Canadian communities .
CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
as a representative of this Eastern Townships region , I have some experience in the issue before us today .
today I want to reiterate my commitment to serving and representing them to the best of my ability and with the utmost dedication .
Mr. Yvan Loubier
we check their passports , but again in this case something has slipped through the cracks .
the other point that concerns me is that in the Quebec pension plan under the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement there is a regulation that says it has to invest in the domestic economy , to try to improve the economy of the province of Quebec in order to give that province a break .
it is predicted that the Liberal government will in 1998 - 99 achieve a balanced budget , using Liberal numbers .
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner

the Speaker :
the federal government does not have a penny .
the government has made tremendous strides while continuing to adhere to five basic principles : controlling government spending rather than increasing taxes , fairness so that no one is left behind , enhanced economic prospects and job growth , and frugality with a commitment to decrease waste in government .

hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
constitutional provisions need time to settle into the social order .
Mr. Monte Solberg
but as we can see , membership is something these people find embarrassing .
call in the members .
i did not find the kind of constructive criticism that I would like to have found from the Leader of the Opposition .
i think it is really quite appalling when one can reach into virtually any document today and find this sort of thing .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
be honest , now .
such a traumatic tax grab would have a devastating affect on job creation .
finally , we suggested introducing federal - provincial mechanisms to deal with securities , food inspection and revenue collection .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
call in the members .
i would like to pay tribute to his wife and family for the wonderful support they gave him during his many years in public life .
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
it will require collaboration and partnership .
i go on to quote Tom Brzustowksi , president of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council :
Ms. Diane St - Jacques :
considering that our country paid tribute to the memory of Lester B . Pearson by mentioning the 100 th anniversary of his birthday in the September 23 speech , the throne speech definitely did not put enough emphasis on foreign affairs .
speaker ' S RULING
that would be a 240 % increase .
it is not only for the reduction of debt .
there would have to be assurances from the Canadian Grain Commission that the necessary quality control measures were in place to avoid co - mingling of grains .
Mr. Jean - Paul Marchand ( Qu 茅 bec East , BQ ) :
we forget entirely that citizens can help each other and that the choices of our fellow citizens must be part of this measurement .
Mr. Stan Dromisky ( Thunder Bay - Atikokan , Lib . ) :
with regard to what the member for Winnipeg - Transcona said , I am aware and I understand full well the serious nature of this request and the rather innovative way that he suggests it might be resolved .
businesses , large and small , are trying to secure a competitive advantage in an increasingly global marketplace .
in the Speech from the Throne , I saw nothing that could be called a well thought out policy on social infrastructures .
Mr. Speaker , this past June nearly 13 million Canadians voted in the federal election which established this 36 th Parliament and our government , and that is a fact .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand
it was very clear to me door to door , coffee party after coffee party and all - candidate meeting after all - candidate meeting that the specifics of the plan , a 50:50 division of any future surpluses , were hugely reassuring to Canadians , particularly those of us in Ontario where the savage government cuts and an unaffordable tax cut are negatively affecting people every day .
the Liberals pride themselves on the political machine vote buying tactics .
i would caution , however , against a plan too heavily focused on Quebec , as it currently is following the Calgary declaration , and doomed to failure because demagogues elsewhere in the country are going to seize on this and once again say that Quebec is running the country , when in fact Quebecers do not wake up every morning wondering whether they are a distinct society .
i am happy to be part of a process that recognizes we have to give these people the tools to compete in the new millennium .
similarly , as part of its policy to hand over the operation of airports , the government is withdrawing from regional airport development .
Mr. Peter Adams
but it is very important to remember that the principles of social justice have long been a part of the Liberal Party ' s philosophy .
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) :
Ms. Aileen Carroll ( Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford , Lib . ) :
the person who was dealing with the department of manpower , a Mr. Thibault , has never given a cent to the Liberal Party .
miss Deborah Grey
the figures are all available from the library .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
even the Liberals admit that payroll taxes kill jobs .
the reality is we have to be more confident in the ability of the management team that will be there .
i wish at this point to refer back to a question that was asked by one of my hon. colleagues from the Conservative Party .
the board members are allowed to set their own pay , benefits and make all the decisions .
the value of the pension fund is equivalent to 2 years benefits , or roughly $ 39 billion .
they know that an informed Canadian public is a far better judge of its health care needs than some distant bureaucrat in Ottawa .
government ORDERS
at this point , all we have are allegations .
according to the information we have available , the funds will be used solely for infrastructure expenditures .
Mr. Peter Adams
heaven forbid , what about cutting capital gains taxes to increase investment and productivity , to reward people for taking risks in our economy ?
Mr. Speaker , to the member for Calgary Southeast , I thank him for the promotion which I have taken note of .
we said that in the end we will be in a position of surplus .
we will continue to build a society that holds dear the fundamental values of equity and equality .
the Speaker :
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
Mr. Paul Szabo
presently members of Parliament swear allegiance exclusively to the Queen .
instead of federal transfers leaving the provinces at the mercy of the federal government ' s goodwill , we are proposing a tax point transfer to the provinces and territories to ensure stable funding .
i am pleased that the leaders of all political parties paid tribute to brother Knowles in the House of Commons this past Thursday .
if each of those four members could have 10 minutes we would waive the five minutes for questions and comments for each one of them respectively , which would have the net effect of extending the business of the House by approximately 10 to 15 minutes .
the current trend is that Reformers are pushing the Liberals into their agenda , away from the previous Tory agenda .
the point is this is a throne speech which leads us down the track of prosperity .
there is a slow erosion in our country of what our parents and grandparents before them struggled to build for generation after generation into one of the best countries in the world .
we have seen Mrs. Lalonde resign from her position as chair of S . O . S . Montfort .
the Deputy Speaker ( Mr. Milliken ) :
Mr. Speaker , last week in this House the Minister of Finance castigated the former Conservative government for attempting to save the Canada pension plan on the backs of those who are unable to pay , our senior citizens .
hon. Sheila Copps
we can support those who need our help , not with another handout but with a hand up .
Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos :
i believe that was for a very particular reason .
are the Liberals not just the same , by pushing through a bigger pension tax ?
the SENATE
i want to speak about one aspect of the plan , the impact of the raising of the payroll taxes to 9.9 % on business , in particular small business .
are the excessive EI premiums levied on workers and businesses today fair ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
chief Justice Isaac was at the same Montreal rules committee meeting , again an unbelievable revelation .
i will do so by quoting someone who was a Liberal and a federalist in Quebec ' s history , but he played a part in recovering Quebec ' s powers - and this person is Jean Lesage - his is one of a number of names associated with Quebec ' s development .
what concrete steps is the prime minister prepared to take to present all the facts concerning this incident to Canadians and to prevent this type of incident from occurring again in the future ?
what has changed from Bill C - 72 ?
it also set the stage for how we as Canadians will prepare our nation to enter the new century as a strong and united country .
it provides benefits that are portable and universal .
how can that relate to the ordinary people in my riding that live in the inner core of the city , that are suffering from day to day to put milk and food on the table ?
gasoline Prices
does the minister intend to pursue the suggestion made by a French group , M 茅 decins du monde , asking that the United Nations intervene in order to put an end to this Algerian crisis that is costing the lives of many men , women and children ?
Mr. Speaker , I listened with interest to the remarks of my colleague from Shefford .
finally , the $ 1 billion Canada millennium scholarship endowment fund that the Prime Minister announced yesterday in response to the Speech from the Throne demonstrates once again our commitment to helping young Canadians .
Mr. Bob Mills
foreign AFFAIRS
i hope we can expect a little patience as we learn the rules and the procedures of the House .
Canadians dislike paying for inefficient government .
Mr. Darrel Stinson

Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) :
the words form Calgary should be taken form what they are , an inclusive and timely message for all to hear .
* * *
the Government will continue to support efforts of individuals , communities and other governments to improve Canadians ' capacity to learn throughout their lives .
surely in a meeting between Israeli and Canadian spy agencies on the eve of such a mission this issue might have come up in the conversation .
that is why I believe strongly that we should keep our country together .
canada has a proud and rich history .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe :
if the contract is a secret one , this does not prove anything .
quite frankly , I do not like the tune he is singing .
i ask where is the new vision for Quebec , the troisi 猫 me voie ? In this throne speech there is no fresh vision for Quebec .
it also affects businesses .
* * *
there are still unanswered questions about these lists .
there remains a great deal to be done '' .
what more does the hon. member want ?
in the absence of a withdrawal I think he must , like a child , carry these words with him for a very long time .
it is very difficult to come into the House and suddenly face opposition questions .
i also want to congratulate and thank the other candidates to the Chair .
enough of your colonialist junkets on the backs of taxpayers to promote the partition of Canada .
Mr. Speaker , on June 2 of this year I received a mandate from the people of Erie - Lincoln to represent their concerns in the House .
the CIBC , the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation and an expected 50,000 participants in 18 cities across this country are hoping to raise $ 3 million for breast cancer research , education , diagnosis and treatment .
Mr. Speaker , I am not sure what they have been smoking , but it was something .
with respect to opening lines of communication , I have over the summer had the opportunity to have the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food travel to our riding and meet with the farmers , the brokers , the average people out there ; not just their OFA representatives , but the actual farmers .
Mr. Speaker , what is at stake here is the integrity of this government and this Parliament .
i would argue that is wrong .
fishing INDUSTRY
Mr. Speaker , that would be more than acceptable .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
it was the finest possible example of team Canada at work .
as I was saying , I served as the vice - chair of the Whitby seniors advisory committee for six years .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
i can assure the Leader of the Opposition - and I am prepared to table a list of organizations , if he wishes , to help him better understand the reality in Quebec - that every player in the area of education , organizations such as the Alliance des professeurs , the F 茅 d 茅 ration des c 茅 geps and the Council of Universities , were in favour and still are in favour of dividing school boards by language .
Thursday , September 25 , 1997
i am committed to working to make Canada a better place to live .
i am surprised that the Bloc Quebecois did not make mention of its support for francophone and Acadian communities in its action plan for the year 2000 , which was tabled last week -
the CTA inquiry into the grain transportation delays that occurred last winter were supposed to start in August .
Mr. Tony Valeri
i want to suggest that our three proposed tests for application to constitutional amendments are broad enough and deep enough to handle any proposed constitutional change , including those of the most radical variety .
but knowing all that , he discourses melodiously in both official languages , expecting us to applaud .
they were all tax and spend governments .
the first is to hold the government accountable , to commend it on actions which we consider in the national interests but to criticize it on actions which we consider not to be in the national interests .
i guess it can be said that the only caucus that has ever come close to being gender balanced in Parliament is the past Conservative caucus .
they grow up not just in a household but in a society .
in 1999 - 2000 the provinces will receive $ 1.4 billion more than is currently budgeted .
the Minister of Human Resources Development , within three hours of learning about the accusation , informed the RCMP in writing .
we believe the hiring and remuneration decisions should be made solely on the basis of merit without regard for gender or other inalienable characteristics '' .
Manitoba just went through what has been called the flood of the century .
the prime minister has set it out very clearly .
after faithful service to his country in the armed forces he became involved in the labour movement and served as either president or vice - president of the Oshawa and District Labour Council for 18 years .
Mr. Bill Matthews
i say that , if francophone Liberals are happy that there is no longer a francophone hospital west of the Outaouais region and if they are happy that health services are not available in French in British Columbia , they are happy being treated as second class citizens .
the old political military base of world public order where effective power was determined by the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles that one had in one ' s arsenal is completely out of date .
the minister should have the decency to rise , to tell the truth and to announce that he is immediately putting an end to his planned cuts for the next three years .
my riding is home to dozens of volunteer organizations serving our young people , the elderly , our families , and providing recreational activities , as well as various cultural communities , which by the way are increasingly diverse and numerous since 32 percent of my constituents are not of francophone origin .
Mr. John Harvard
of course it was a program that -
this was a viable small business and the increase in the Canada pension plan premium , a payroll tax , would have taken 25 % of my gross profits from that construction company .
on the contrary if there has ever been a government in the last number of years that has always stood up for Canada , it is this one .

are we to understand that he would expect France to sit back and act as if nothing had happened should the federal government arbitrarily reject the result of a democratic vote held in Quebec ?
shortly , I will be announcing the creation of a scientific advisory committee comprised of Canadians well known and respected in their fields , whose wise advice and comments will assist the Health Protection Branch in fulfilling its responsibilities better .
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) :
nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class of persons have by law or a practice in the province at the union .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak in this debate on the motion to refer Bill C - 4 to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri - Food .
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) :
this acknowledgement comes as a result of our tremendous strengths .
if the decision is to extend both parts III and IV , this would result in both pooling and single desk selling .
the RCMP is simply there meeting that need as requested .
moreover , for new programs , the foundation will require partners to contribute 50 percent or 60 percent of total funding .
Mr. Speaker , Robert Kennedy once said each time a person stands up for an ideal , strikes out against injustice , they send forth a tiny ripple of hope , and crossing each other from a million different centres of energy , those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of resistance .

Canadians understand that Americans pay less tax but they also understand that 30 percent of Americans cannot afford to go to the doctor .
some hon. members :
the hon. member across knows procedure .
it is shameful .
over the last four years I have known him to be a member of Parliament who really cares .
to sow it in your garden .
i am sure that when the members of the official opposition speak they will point to this change and note that it is reflective of what Canadians have said and that it is a positive change .
adjournment PROCEEDINGS
a bill was rammed through the House which denied the injured people due process to file a grievance within our justice system .
we want Canada to be strong .
Mr. Speaker , I believe you would find unanimous consent for the following order :
the SENATE
Mr. Roy Cullen
in other words , the Canadian Constitution is to be amended at the request of the Quebec assembly by means of an amending formula which the Quebec assembly does not recognize .
the Speaker :
under the Reform Party plan it would take 1.3 million Canadians right off the tax rolls .
one would think that here in this last Parliament of this century , in this throne speech which sets the agenda for the new millennium that there would be a great vision , a new departure , a new direction for Canada .
this private member ' s bill would allow murder charges to be laid if the assault resulted in death , no matter how long the victim was able to hang on to life .
[ editor ' s Note :
enough of worrying Quebec ' s business community with talk of partition '' .
provincial officials are consulted through conference calls and negotiated debriefings .
we are very glad to see you as perhaps the first non - member of the government sitting in that position .
i say we have to fight against that and we have to make sure that the Reform Party gets nowhere near the levers of power in Canada .
Mrs. Francine Lalonde
Mr. Jack Ramsay :
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Frappier , who is the son of a Liberal appointed judge , was given a plum position there .

it is their livelihood that is on the line .
but what the Reform Party cannot tell us is how they will do it or at what price and what will be lost .

in the Saguenay , and in Manitoba , thousands of Canadians battled together to save homes and lives , to help their neighbours and to rebuild communities .
madam Speaker , congratulations on your appointment .
Mr. Speaker , my answer to the hon. member is that I am a Quebecer , I am proud to be a Quebecer and a Canadian , and that if we consider the latest polls , many Quebecers still want to be part of Canada .

however , there has been a suggestion that the farmers who will sit as members of the board of directors for the Canadian Wheat Board will for some reason be corrupt and that this wheat board legislation will protect corrupt farmers .
Mr. Speaker , it is quite obvious that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has difficulty with this question .
however , just as important are the provisions designed to ensure that the board remains accountable not just to the federal and provincial governments but to the Canadian public .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the U.S. is looking at this right now .
a message from His Excellency the Governor General transmitting estimates for the financial year ending March 31 , 1998 , was presented by the President of the Treasury Board and read by the Speaker to the House .
what should concern us all , if we are concerned at all about the independence of committees , is that government members on this committee vetted the report with the Minister of Industry and it was subsequently changed .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
the official named , in my view , is in contempt of Parliament for his actions .

if the hon. member for Calgary Southwest had consulted with a competent lawyer he would have been told that a preamble has no legal force in the courts .
what does the minister plan to do to stop this blatant conflict of interest ?
the Speaker :
however I would like to continue to demonstrate that this government has made commitments , has established priorities and will continue to meet those priorities .
talking about people who have taken hits , let us not forget the public servants in this country who have been working since 1990 without a raise .
Mr. Art Hanger ( Calgary Northeast , Ref. ) :

as parliamentarians we have a tremendous task ahead of us to steer our nation into the 21 st century .
why is this government taking such a hard line approach toward British Columbia ?

some hon. members :
they need more top grade scientific equipment to teach their people , to give them the skills to become competitive in the 21 st century .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay :
how can the minister , who just signed a joint agreement with Israel , be so sure of himself and dismiss out of hand the allegations of collusion between the two governments made by Mr. Spector ?
as a Canadian , whether I live Quebec , Ontario or British Columbia , I like to believe I have freedom .
health care is very much an area of concern for Canadians , especially as our population grows older .

Ms. Susan Whelan
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :

Mr. Speaker , I have several petitions to present , so I ask for your indulgence as I go through them .
canada PENSION PLAN
think about it , my friend .
a point of clarification for the Chair .
the last concern to which I will speak today is crucial .
the collective bargaining process can work and will work .
the Government of Quebec , through the Hon. Lucien Bouchard , recently announced amendments to the Quebec pension plan comparable to the proposed changes to the CPP , with the result that premiums will be the same .
i do not know whether we can trust Liberal numbers , but let us say they are fairly accurate .
the Speaker :
if not kissing cousins , they slept in close proximity to each other .
however , with billion dollar transactions involved , what mechanisms will be introduced to ensure good risk management ?
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take this opportunity to publicly acknowledge your appointment to the Chair .
* * *
i would like to know if they agree with that .
i know many of our colleagues opposite are also in the same position , which means they are able to plan for their own retirement and , more importantly , to help other people do the same , and walk them through the process .
it is with great humility that I rise today to give my first speech in the House of Commons .
those proposed changes offer nothing to make the Canada pension plan self - financing .
we have quorum .
i commend the government for the positive statements in the throne speech , particularly the initiatives regarding aboriginal people .
take a good look at Statistics Canada ' s figures .
we believe that it would also undermine the farmers ' confidence in the board and thereby diminish the board ' s credibility and effectiveness .
this treaty , " he said , " will save tens of thousands of lives '' .
we as a government are very concerned with the situation of student tuition fees and debt .
i think his great parliamentary skills were confirmed during the famous pipeline debate , in 1956 .
the Canadian forces are often called upon to perform difficult and sometimes dangerous work .
we have no more right to tell American committees who they will have before them than they have to tell our committees of this House who to have before them .
it is good management .
they are people who work in the airline industry , the banking industry , the railroads and the post office .
they are the responsibility as well of business and industry that are able to grow and prosper in an economy turned around by the courage of this Liberal government .
this is really sad , because Montreal used to be the most important city in Canada .
i have some sense compassion for them .

i want to have the hon. member understand why I am sitting in this House and what gave me the push to get in here .
i will repeat what I said in my speech .
when the money comes back in , all Canadians will benefit from it .
i must remind all hon. members that it is necessary to address the Chair in questions or comments .
as we begin that new role and analyse the Speech from the Throne , we owe it to the public to share with it how we see this role being discharged .
i assure the House that I will look at all aspects of the matter because the privileges of a member and the privileges of members are at stake .

once I had made my decision and taken action in the form of the letter I sent him March 5 , I so advised the chief of staff of the Prime Minister of Canada .
however , and I deeply regret having to say this , there seems to be a blatant lack of accountability and transparency on the part of certain individuals working for the federal government .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
the Parliament of Canada is the only institution directly elected by all Canadians with the mandate to protect and express the national interest .
i would apply the words exactly : " The speech from the throne has been for some years a very dry skeleton .
all Canadians have a right to be consulted if it is going to affect their wallets .

speech FROM THE THRONE
my experience in the relatively short time I have been here has been that this place is fascinating and can be very important and productive .
this country offers the best standard of living in the world .
but , for the time being , the situation is -
i think we will see that those reforms strike the right balance between due concern for victims , due concern for the safety of society and due concern for a criminal justice system that reflects a balance of values .
in my opinion the nays have it .
for those reasons we cannot support this motion before the House today .
there were 36 individual tax increases brought in by this government .
i am sure the hon. member would not want officials of the department of Indian affairs or any public servant to risk releasing confidential information or violating the spirit of an act of Parliament .
i get books out of the library .
it is the desire of some in the corporate sector to move back to a time when individual problems , regardless of circumstances , were an individual responsibility .
it is not only Quebec which is looking for changes in the federation .
every year we are obliged to spend some money on some programs because of the problems in society which need to be taken care of .
we will continue our efforts on two oceans , the Atlantic and the Pacific , to ensure respect and full compliance with existing international law obligations , both multilateral and also special bilateral as to the protection of endangered fish resources and their equitable sharing under law .
i have it here and I can even table it .
of course it also involves Quebec - Canada constitutional relations and is therefore part and parcel of the national unity issue .
it went all over the place .
it cannot substitute for the government in any way whatsoever .
the debate has two levels .
don ' t legislate to us .
it will now be reduced to some $ 2,500 , again making it more difficult , particularly for women who are , more often than not , the recipient of those benefits .
the underwriters feel the amount in the EI fund is appropriate .
i was sitting on the other side of the House in opposition during the Mulroney Conservative government era .
they must become a more integral part and focus of our global trade strategy .
that is why I am supporting the establishment of a telecommunications learning institute in Etobicoke in association with Humber College .
we owe $ 46 billion to buy virtually nothing of value for Canadian citizens today .
Stanley Knowles began his career as a minister of the Christian gospel .
in other words , we must take measures that are appropriate to the specific problems of the regions .
Mr. Speaker , as has been mentioned in the House by the prime minister and the leader of the official opposition party , Premier Frank McKenna will be stepping down effective October 13 , which is the 10 th anniversary of his leadership of the Liberal Party of New Brunswick .
yet I fear there is even more .
the Speaker :
this is a sure way to irritate provincial governments , which in turn are forced to make corresponding cuts in these same areas , in response to dramatic cuts in federal transfer payments .
she believes it is up to her and the Liberals to determine Canadian identity .
Mr. Bill Blaikie
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
this government has delivered on its key 1993 election promise to restore fiscal responsibility to the nation after the record $ 42 billion annual deficit we inherited from the predecessor Conservative government .
while it appears that he had the consent of a few band members , the information being sought related to the entire band and was not specific to those members .
canada PENSION PLAN
our government should be congratulated on its clearly stated intention to contribute to the effort by federal , provincial and territorial governments to develop a more collaborative approach to strengthening and modernizing Canada ' s social union .
the oil and gas industry will suffer tremendous financial losses as will the electrical industry in Alberta and now in Ontario which will return to coal burning after serious problems at Ontario Hydro nuclear plants .
i look forward to seeing not only your smiling face but also your good judgment exercised during the next number of months .
therefore the transparency for Canada pension plan of the future is that same transparency that is in private plans throughout the rest of Canada .
i have a question for my hon. colleague .
the Government of Canada can have no greater duty or responsibility .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
the people of Oxford have sent me here as their representative , a responsibility I do not take lightly .
we must seek closer partnerships with the business community .
their methods have generally been the peaceful demonstration and the reasoned brief .
apart from medicare there are other subjects of importance that will preoccupy the government during the current mandate .
this means no one was available to work on these requests for two months .
one issue that is more of a concern to British Columbia than it is to Quebec is revamping federal institutions , especially Parliament .
i do hate to intervene but I remind the hon. member no names .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire
it is also a pleasure to know that I am done with this long and complicated sentence .
i am sad that Stanley Knowles did not live to see this day , that he did not live to see the official return to the House of Commons of the party which he helped to found .
communities
this is how we will spur continuing job creation and sustained growth in our standard of living in the 21 st century .
certainly Mr. Bernardo and any others who find themselves in his situation will now have to go through a process of judicial screening .
that was really demonstrated during the flood in Manitoba .
madam Speaker , I will certainly respond .
Mr. Michel Guimond
Mr. Speaker , I want to say a few words on the bill before the House .
Mr. Speaker , point of order .
on the day of the meeting the departmental regional office became aware that members of other bands in Alberta were also accompanying the member to the meeting .
in a report tabled in the House on December 18 , 1987 the Standing Committee on Elections , Privileges and Procedure recommended that :
when we strip away the politics of all of this , when we take away the partisanship that often clouds a decision that has to be taken , we find that what is being done is necessary .
we could have expected a Canadian agenda .
that spirit was shown on the battlefields of Ypres in 1915 and Vimy Ridge in 1917 .
Len Taylor , our former agriculture critic from The Battlefords - Meadow Lake , made known his and our party ' s unhappiness with the government ' s procedure at that time .
does the member have any fears that if this section is struck from 93 ( 1 ) it might create a precedent for striking that section from the Manitoba act ?
citizen - INITIATED REFERENDUM ACT
we need to celebrate the fact that we have improved the number of Canadians with jobs .
if we were to move in the direction that is proposed by the official opposition we would see a deterioration in a significant way of Canada ' s social safety net which is made up not only of our pension system but of the employment insurance system and the health care system .
we are doing everything to make sure those concerns are addressed .
the Bloc Quebecois , and increasingly all of Quebec , is very clearly unanimous on this as well .
heaven knows this Liberal government has never balanced a government budget .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the hon. member ' s question .
we are ready to work with all our partners - the provinces and territories , the private sector , non profit agencies , the volunteer sector and all Canadians - to better equip our country to meet the needs of Canadians .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , mismanagement ?
because of the importance of grain marketing to Canada , especially in the west , I urge all members to give the bill the attention it deserves and to take counsel from the members among us speaking particularly from rural and agricultural ridings .
i see the hon. member for Wild Rose is seeking the floor .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
the government knows where the people of Vaughan - King - Aurora stand on such issues .
madam Speaker , I want to say a few words today in support of Bill C - 4 .
this is less than what the provinces pay other bond holders .
* * *
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) :
the Reform Party is guilty .
Mr. Jason Kenney
we realized that the Canada pension plan is not unlike many pension plans around the world , whether they be private or public pension plans .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
aboriginal AFFAIRS
i am confident Mr. Bastarache will carry out his duties as justice of the supreme court competently and efficiently .
the things that are working well now in Atlantic Canada come from the private sector .
Mr. Speaker , while the deficit is under control and there is in excess of $ 7.5 billion sitting in the employment insurance fund , there are still unemployed workers struggling to survive on a meagre $ 39 a week .
perhaps he just did not want to debate it .
Mr. John Finlay ( Oxford , Lib . ) :
the investigation was under way .
you know , everything is public information nowadays .
in February of this year the Liberal government acting with the provinces took the lead to place the Canada pension plan on a solid financial footing .
Mr. Ken Epp
that was the reason I thought it important to mention a few facts .
i suggest that the hon. member for Calgary Southwest , instead of proposing that bills have preambles , should be condemning preambles .
some hon. members :
it is not that there are not good people in the Senate .
as we move toward the millennium I feel extremely proud to be a Canadian .
Mr. Speaker , as the hon. member no doubts knows , given that there is an ongoing investigation it would be inappropriate for me to identify people being investigated whether they be on this side of the House , whether they be on that side of the House or anywhere in Canada .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
i want to say that no bill will ever come before the House this session which is closer to my constituents than this bill .
in short , we made all the changes needed to develop a less costly model , but also a more modern and efficient model .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau :
so we will be taking five minutes each on this issue .
he even added : " A simple majority is not a principle , but democracy is '' .
what sets our region apart from others is that when we have a problem , we look for a solution , not a culprit .
the popularity of recycling programs demonstrates that when efforts toward sustainability can be brought into a legitimate arena , the public will respond .
i sincerely hope that through hard work , honest conduct and devotion to constituency matters that I can repay Saultites for the confidence they have shown in me .
justice
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
does she recognize that 20 years ago we were in a situation where the three leading federal parties - we tend to forget this , but a little over 20 years ago the Conservative Party , the NDP and the Liberal Party did recognize the existence of two nations or peoples in Canada .
the exploitation of aboriginals by health professionals is a problem that has been known for ten years .
it is conceivable that after it becomes a mixed enterprise the Canadian Wheat Board might qualify to be an administrator .
will the minister assure the House that he will have his department review the cuts it made to the last post fund and deal with the difficulties and injustices it has caused to the spouses of those families ?
order , please .
i have argued that reducing employment insurance premiums by 70 cents per $ 100 of income would create hundreds of thousands of jobs .
on January 30 , therefore , it was also sent to the Soci 茅 t 茅 qu 茅 b 茅 coise du d 茅 veloppement de la main - d ' oeuvre ' s head office .
this lack of vision and commitment is sad for Quebec as well as for Canada .
forty percent more Canadians will be making increased demands on our health system .
trade
the future belongs to societies whose economy is sound ; who invest in knowledge , education and innovation ; whose population is healthy ; whose children are well prepared to learn ; and who focus on securing a high quality of life for all citizens .
i think it is a good system .
inasmuch as the throne speech stated that the government would " develop alternatives to incarceration for low risk non - violent offenders '' , would the hon. member be prepared to support an amendment to the Criminal Code that would exempt violent offenders from conditional sentencing ?
in reference to lowering the premiums , the hon. member knows we have lowered premiums each year .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
stop making shady deals
we might wonder why he was paroled .
i do want to thank those representatives of the parties not adding additional speakers , in particular the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois in this instance .
we want to gather input from Canadians and that is what we intend on doing .
we know that economic growth solutions in Atlantic Canada will be found in Atlantic Canada if each of the four provinces seeks solutions on their own for a stronger economy .
part of the problem is that applications for the CPP have doubled .
HOMECOMING '98
i am also delighted to see the hon. member back in the House , and I wish him the best of luck .
1995 had record bankruptcies .
it is 500 - 26 - 007787 - 974 .
is the member aware of the fact that unless we make it possible for the aboriginal people to sustain themselves , we cannot talk about them being independent ?
i had calls from newspaper reporters .
the hon. member for Willowdale .
arthritis is a debilitating disease that threatens the independence and quality of life of thousands of Canadian men and women .
my constituents strongly believe that health and justice must work together in partnership with communities not only to fight crime but to fight the causes of crime .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
we have challenges before us .
it will be recalled that these deficits were in the several hundreds of millions of dollars in 1991 .
Mr. Preston Manning
Mr. Speaker , I have already made it clear that we are going to do whatever is necessary to ensure that the health protection branch , which is an important service of government , is there to safeguard the health and safety of Canadians .
i ask that the member withdraw his comments .
i believe he has introduced a private member ' s bill related to that .
amendment to the amendment
under Bill C - 4 , 10 out 15 Canadian Wheat Board directors will be elected by prairie farmers before the end of 1998 . That establishes the two - thirds majority farmers called for .
current federal requirements for disability benefits limit eligibility to those who have contributed to the plan for two of the past three years or for five of the past ten past years .
what is the point of going to the people with electoral platforms and having them judged and voted on ?
i am convinced that our government will approach the whole issue of national unity in a spirit of co - operation and partnership with the provinces .
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron ( Verch 猫 res , BQ ) :
i was extremely sensitive to his remark about this maybe not being enough .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Liberals killed debate on the biggest tax grab in Canadian history .
madam Speaker , I would first like to welcome my friend from Kelowna back to the House of Commons .
how can you explain that the Prime Minister did not issue a directive on an ethical conduct to his ministers after the Minister of Human Resources Development informed him of the RCMP investigation ?
now they want to make resources available to help young people get back in the work force .
all these things together are what provide the best educational and developmental opportunities for our children .
Mr. Speaker , the government speaks of taxes .
foreign AFFAIRS
are you brave enough to give back the money you have taken , you have stolen , from the poor , from the most disadvantaged ?
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
this is why we intend to intensify our efforts in the development of job opportunities , for young Canadians especially .
as a result he has less intestinal fortitude than a model leader of a province should have .
if the question could be rephrased I would permit the solicitor general to answer it .
in closing I invite my colleagues on the opposite side of the House to take a serious look at the kind of economic record that 30 years of Liberal and Tory big government spending has brought us .
the United Mine Workers of America , District 26 , has called for Devco to develop the Donkin mine .
that is why there was another referendum in 1995 .
it is not just those wicked separatists , that awful Bloc , who are demanding this .
no one would seek to describe a picture in which everything is perfect or all the work is done .
i did a calculation for one of the communities I represent , the city of Kamloops .
it is in committee where members and people will be able to appear and make representations , but your members do not want to have a debate on it .
we have known that for some time .
i am having so much fun here I do not think I will ever retire .
they merely iron out some of the wilder fluctuations .
the Speaker :
i think I speak for all of us here when I say that each of us has had at least one teacher , whether primary or at the secondary level , who made a lasting impression on us .
it is very inappropriate for the separatists from the Bloc Quebecois and the PQ to question the integrity and legitimacy of an institution like the Supreme Court of Canada , because they never hesitate to reward their separatist friends , including some who are not even competent to sit .
how are they going to deal with securing their retirement future ?
if this legislation goes ahead as it is written , the CPP is headed for certain disaster because the young will not support it and they will eventually defeat it .
we did not understand the minister ' s great hurry and we thought there should have been more opportunity for debate in the House prior to the referral .
that represents about 10 percent of the Canadian workforce .
i go back to today ' s opposition motion .
Mr. Dennis J . Mills
for the information of the hon. member opposite , as a result of electoral reform , T 茅 miscouata is now part of the riding of Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , represented by our colleague , Paul Cr 锚 te .
how about eliminating grants and handouts to special interest groups whose sole purpose is to demand more government spending ?
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
some hon. members :
each year more exploration is going on in the north , in particular mineral exploration .
all of us in the NDP caucus feel the sense of responsibility people have entrusted in us .
i would like to take a few moments to sketch the background of this particular motion and resolution .
the throne speech is like a shell game .
again the prime minister dragged his feet .
as I look at the pages in front of me , I think of their retirement , which may seem like a few years away for them .
madam Speaker , I am pleased to be in this House a third time .
third , it imposes a 73 percent increase in employees and employers CPP contributions .
second , we are now working with the ILO to come up with a new draft convention dealing with children working in hazardous industries .
the guards want action from management and have come up with their own cost effective solutions .
freight is the primary reason for the high cost of living in Nunavut .
is it an economic mission or a partitionist mission ?
Mr. Preston Manning
what is missing from the debate is that there is a difference between consumption and investment .
Stanley Knowles was a man of conviction ; he was always prepared to fight for the poor and the elderly .
Mr. Robert D . Nault
i suggest that perhaps the publishing industry has demonstrated such success because of its recognition of the tremendous talent of our Canadians with roots around the world :
that is noteworthy .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
business is business .
the fact is that at the present time , the Canada Pension Plan does not do regular evaluations to ensure that people receiving disability benefits are still entitled to them , so that costs have spiralled dramatically in recent years .
as we continue this 36 th session of Parliament our job is to secure the future of this great nation .
the ships would smash on the rocks , people would loot the ships and the people on the wrecked ships would die .
* * *
he said " We will cut our own departmental spending a lot more than we will cut the transfers to the provinces '' .
they go into a separate fund , not government revenues , and because of recent changes the Canadian people have suggested will now be invested like other pension plans .
the progress that we have made , the benefits that progress is bringing to this country and how we are going to bring this country into the next millennium , that is the discussion we will have .
these are some of the priorities we have set out .
for instance , the poll states that 28 percent of Canadians would like to see a personal income tax cut , 3 percent want to see a business tax cut , and another 20 percent want to see both personal income taxes and corporate taxes reduced .
madam Speaker , I appreciate the member ' s remarks .
we have with us today a large group of very distinguished Canadians .
we have been elected to continue our prudent fiscal management , but make sure that we are able to be compassionate and look after those less fortunate .
the changing economic times require some changes .
the deficit is the amount of money which is being borrowed .
as a legal scholar , as a business person and as a judge , Mr. Justice Bastarache has proven himself to be exemplary .
we do have an employment insurance tax but we are doing everything we possibly can , and have done so since we were elected , to reduce the employment insurance tax not once , not twice but thrice .
unfortunately , the government ' s lack of action in the shipbuilding sector is just as bad as it was during the Liberals ' first mandate .
finally , on this issue of the financing of political parties , the hon. member stated that , because a corporation has given us money , we are in the pay of this corporation .
the Speaker :
* * *
the division of the Northwest Territories is the most significant and exciting event taking place before the turn of the century .
Mr. Jack Ramsay
now that is really playing with words to mislead us in this area too .
even the prime minister has said that he supports legally binding targets , but where is the plan ?
the Speaker
the first outlined the important role trade plays in the economic life of Canada .
stony Reserve
the challenge to other members of this House , and I do not just say Reform members , I say the challenge to other members in this House , including some of the government backbenchers who know that what I am saying is true , our challenge is that what realities the government has failed to recognize , let us recognize .
Mr. Speaker , I wish to ask the government House leader to advise the House of the nature of the government ' s business for the remainder of this week and into next .
the future of the CPP is a question that every working Canadian and every retired Canadian needs to carefully consider because working Canadians will soon have an extra $ 700 - plus every year taken from their income to keep this current scheme afloat and retired Canadians will also be watching carefully to make sure that their pension security is there .
there were some very eloquent remarks from the member from Scarborough Centre on Canadian patriotism and the importance of national unity .
instead of going over old ground when it was elected to office on October 25 , 1993 , the Liberal government helped put an end to the crisis .
the presentation of the scroll of honour will be awarded in Bonn , Germany today and I am sure the House congratulates the Federation of Canadian Municipalities on achieving this outstanding award on behalf of Canadian municipal governments in this country .
no wonder Quebec is now thinking of sovereignty , of autonomy .
whatever you do , adhere to the Union .
our maritime traditions are well known ; the courage of our military men and women serving overseas , the resourcefulness of our current armed forces and civilian personnel rising to new challenges .
we devised a national flagging system to help crown attorneys identify high risk offenders .
there were no limits on spending .
hon. Christine Stewart
we would have to examine it very closely , but I am inclined to agree with the member that a message has to be sent to the citizens of country that violence cannot be tolerated in any way , shape or form .
no , Quebec does not want a return to the era of Trudeau , who , it will be remembered , created a Ministry of Fitness and even a Ministry of Urban Affairs ; all to hamstring the L 茅 vesque government .
the Prime Minister never said that it was a huge step forward on which we could pin all our hopes .
it is a wonderful opportunity on the part of any parliamentarian to be able to participate in the process .
the question raised in many people ' s minds is why are we repeating the same mistakes that we made in the past ?
if they had their own plan they would get $ 26,000 a year or $ 260,000 by the time they turn 75 .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
it is gratifying to hear that the deficit will effectively be eliminated in the next fiscal year .
we have been doing the things necessary while the other government previous to ours left it .
such an amendment could potentially require the use of the general amending formula , the seven and fifty formula .
the Speaker :
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
* * *
the fact that one out of five seniors lives in poverty is immoral and we ought to change that .
speech FROM THE THRONE
i have had before me a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by day , the policy of true Canadianism , of moderation and conciliation .
we must also recognize the areas which require attention : continued quality health care , reduced child poverty , improved community safety , lower unemployment and sustained economic growth .
i would also like to take the opportunity to thank my constituents of Calgary - Nose Hill for their confidence in me and for returning me to this position as their elected representative in the Parliament of Canada .
the prime minister said this part of his speech in English and so with a certain amount of pride and perhaps trepidation I will attempt to say the prime minister ' s words in French .
i was most impressed with the prime minister ' s knowledge and interest in these issues .
it was the labour government which introduced a number of privatization measures and caused the New Zealand economy to revive and avoid the country going into bankruptcy .
so we were told that they did not know what we were doing with the employment insurance surplus .
when Reform members make inappropriate statements and members from the opposition benches make what some would consider inappropriate statements , it is the House of Commons and the people of Canada who will pay for their legal bills .
i think I have a duty and an obligation as a parliamentarian to represent them as well .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
the information in these files is obviously not confidential from a commercial point of view .
Mr. Speaker , there is nothing about this that makes the government reluctant to share with other Canadians what is going on .
in the last little while we have moved so quickly on so many offloadings and dismantling of national government responsibility that I would appeal to members of the House , as we head into a new term , to remember the Chamber is not a rubber stamp for the provinces .
there is not unanimous consent .
i think we are still in a bit of a war but now it is to try to battle back those who want to spend other people ' s money .
during the last Parliament the auditor general published a scathing report on the operation of crown corporations .
we need to build for the future through trade expansion and value added products .
could the minister address those two issues , the rate of child poverty in this country and the fact that we have aboriginal people living in worse than third world conditions ?
Mrs. Monique Guay
* * *
last week I was able to pick out the beaches where I swam , the wharf where I fished and the streets where I walked , played and cycled .
can they imagine any other corporation , club , or charity to which they belong answering questions concerning decisions made at an annual general meeting by saying " I can ' t answer that " or " If I told you that I would have to kill you '' .
i therefore have little to say for the ethics commissioner , because , between you and me , he is not very good at his job and is certainly the government ' s accomplice in keeping silent on a number of matters .
i certainly am serious .
is the member suggesting that we should continue with a blindfold on in the fervent hope that things will be so bright that we will be able to offer all kinds of benefits and provisions under the Canada pension plan and nobody is really going to have to pay for it ?
that is why we have been pushing successive governments in this country since the Reform Party was founded a decade ago to get our finances under control so we could let Canadians keep more of their own money .
we are trying to get the facts .
that is one of the reasons that it is not able to pay for the costs in the future .
as many in the House know , Beryl represented the former riding of Nepean over the course of two Parliaments .
that fly comes from the Conservative government of the province of Ontario which has consistently refused and neglected to take the steps necessary in order to allow the government to legalize some aspects of gambling which would help the casino to prosper .
i would like to close my remarks by saying that the House has a unique opportunity to really grasp the future .
with the money that has been put into the plan , he and his party have run up a half trillion dollar debt .
i am proud to represent the people of Winnipeg South .
i suggest we write down on our pads the names of some of those young people and keep their concerns in mind when we analyse and review this bill .
in our last mandate we took action to deal with these issues .
surely those days should be far , far behind us .
does she agree with that ?
it is ironic reciting these words on an issue which was brought to the attention of the then Liberal government over 40 years ago by a Progressive Conservative member of Parliament .
to understand the magnitude of this we must consider that the approvals within Oxford represented nearly 25 percent of the total approvals within the province of Ontario .
i checked with officials from the Department of Human Resources Development in my riding and they do not consider this information to be public either .
Mr. Speaker , the House is now debating the single largest tax increase in Canadian history , a $ 10 billion tax grab that will take 10 % off the paycheques of every Canadian and will forever make the future of young Canadians poorer .
therefore I expect that the minister will reintroduce it in the House in the coming weeks .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) :
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
the Speech from the Throne does not address the growing gap in this country between the rich and the poor , between the haves and the have nots .
health
where does it want to do some cutbacks ?
he was extremely well liked and highly respected by all members of the House , on all sides of the House , during the time he was clerk of this Chamber .
i do not know if members realize that compared to our G - 7 trading partners , the personal income tax burden is 52 percent higher as a per cent of the total economy than in the U.S. , Japan , U . K , France and Italy .
annual reports will provide a more complete information package and will explain how administrative problems are being addressed .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
the technical parts of the bill , essential as they are , are simply a means to that end .
we are providing this .
first ministers and territorial leaders will be working on the issue when they meet this fall .
but I can already hear those opposite saying that the member for Berthier - Montcalm is totally unaware that they have an ethics commissioner even .
that is just what we need , a bunch of senators managing $ 200 billion public dollars .
they do good work .
Mr. Speaker , last night we learned that there is a special government list of companies seeking government funds and that this information gets sent out to the government ' s regional ministers and the local MPs whose ridings are affected .
in his question , the hon. member mentioned the Minister of Human Resources Development and what he did .
again , it is the National Assembly ' s prerogative to act upon this consensus .
having put that aside , I point out that the ambassador to Mexico made his own decision that the comments he made which were published in a Mexican magazine , were inappropriate and were going to limit his effectiveness .
we will have to welcome new ideas that are citizen based , pursue more aggressively the strategic alliances available to us and consider collaboration an essential ingredient for our national and regional success .
these are just some of the results of the cross Canada consultations that took place involving the federal government , the provincial governments and the territories .
if I had influence over the minds of the people of Canada , any power over their intellect , I would leave them with this legacy .
this is a fine example of how good long - term jobs can be created in Quebec .
* * *
i say we will never let the federal government get involved in Quebec ' s schools .
fully half of the media ' s coverage of Mother Teresa ' s death was devoted to criticism of her life and beliefs .
finally , and more particularly , our determination to serve our fellow Quebeckers well can be seen in our desire to take action to help the greater Montreal area make the transition to the new economy .
i was describing where I think we need to go as a country .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
we have had a number of meetings with stakeholders across the country attended by my colleagues in agriculture and the minister responsible for the wheat board .
the reality is we need to do more investing in people and I am very proud to be part of a government that recognizes that .
once again I quote the statistic for those young people who are watching and listening today .
Mr. Speaker , you suggested that if one had any new information that might help you would receive this .
the hon. member made reference to an elderly lady in his constituency .
we have an investment of nearly $ 40 billion and probably through a better system of investing on the open market the plan can gain more money for future people involved with Canada pensions .
* * *
getting back to the issue of health care and the government ' s plans as stated in the throne speech , I would like to talk about the way the cuts were distributed .
in this same Canadian tradition of internationalism , the Government will undertake the following initiatives :
Mr. Speaker , I have listened with great interest to my colleague , the hon. member for Oxford .
to my constituents in Calgary - Nose Hill , a profound thank you and a commitment to them to act in their interests over the next term of Parliament .
for the first time in the history of the wheat board we will actually have representative democracy .
i hope that everyone of us here will make a commitment , will inherit that passport and be able to benefit from what is one of the greatest citizenships in the world , being a Canadian .
i think that what my personal experience helps to illustrate is that in a truly free country merit is the only requirement for success .
will the Minister of Health agree that the colossal waste of money cancelling the helicopter contract would have been better spent on health and education transfers to provinces ?
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the subamendment ?
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy :
over the years the government has called crime in British Columbia as isolated incidents .
surely not ; that would be too glaring a contradiction .
some hon. members :
i could go on .
here again there were promises from the Liberals , which never led anywhere and never will , because the federal system cannot be reformed .
this avenue might be chosen with great reluctance , but I cite the words of a poet , Robert Frost :
how can the minister justify a policy that condemns 1.4 million Canadians to continuing unemployment ?
adjournment PROCEEDINGS
yet here we are , almost on the eve of the 21 st century , and the prime minister is still indulging in this patronage riddled practice .
health
maybe his judgment is not correct .
it was a remarkable show of Canadian solidarity .
i think that the hon. member , who is well versed in and loves constitutional issues , cannot make a parallel and argue that a bilateral approach would create a dangerous precedent by supporting the legitimate sovereigntist option to act unilaterally .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
they need strong families and they need safe communities , good schools , good health care and opportunities to develop .
reform believes most strongly that education is a matter of provincial responsibility and that provincial jurisdiction over education should be respected and enhanced .
i dig up figures .
Mr. Michel Gauthier
it is a positive and constructive statement and affirmation of important values about what Canada is , and what makes us Canadian .
i am pleased to present two petitions with the signatures of 80 Canadians from my constituency who are concerned that their freedom of choice in health care is becoming increasingly curtailed and threatened by government regulation .
if we commit to targeting this vital sector with the goal of developing commercially viable , sustainable development practices , then we as a nation will not only have demonstrated the ability to live within our means , but we will also have developed the capacity to live within our world .
yet there is very little in the throne speech on how the Liberal government intends to address the threat of separation from these Quebec politicians .
in short , our government will secure Canada ' s future through our youth .
Mr. Speaker , it is often said that travel broadens the mind , but I did not think that the Premier of Quebec could be so transformed after fewer than two days away .
increasing support for the arts makes it possible for Canadian culture to reach audiences at home and abroad .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
as a member of the government party , I ran in the last election on a government platform which laid out the commitments that the Liberal Party was making to go into a new parliament .
oral QUESTION PERIOD

this motion has been negotiated with all House leaders , and I am pleased to propose it to the House .
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) :
the Government is firmly committed to a publicly administered , comprehensive health care system that provides universal access to high quality care for Canadians anywhere in the country .
the government is creating more difficulties for people by introducing a bill that will force low income workers to pay more in contributions , that will cause fewer people to obtain benefits by tightening the eligibility for disability , that will create greater clawbacks on seniors ' incomes , that will take away a person ' s right to have his or her own benefit by consolidating the income of both spouses .
hon. Sergio Marchi
what the prime minister failed to mention is that the national debt is $ 82 billion higher than it was under Mulroney .
indeed , who would not do a double take on hearing of certain odd doings like those engaged in by organizers of the Liberal Party of Canada , who had the lists of grant applications in their possession before they had even been approved ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
perhaps what the hon. member -
virtually every marketing innovation which farmers have debated over the past several years will be possible under this new law .
if so , I will give him a moment .
an hon. member :
he knows full well that , as a man of principle , I simply must reply to the opposition leader .
this is exactly what the present government brings to mind .
as you know , I was a young employee of the House of Commons at the time and could see firsthand the kindness , the wisdom and the intelligence of my boss , Alistair Fraser .
trade
one thing we recognize in small business is when we only have so much coming in , in terms of general revenue , we can only afford to do so much with that amount .
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅 ( L 茅 vis , BQ ) :
we think this should be completely reviewed and the primary producers should be involved in what grain goes in what train cars and is delivered to what port and when .
middle aged Canadians would have to be given options to stay in their present arrangements or transfer to the new plan .
hon. David Kilgour
an hon. member :
not only does she have no evidence , but she attacked a member of the business community and she sullied a reputation .
it is equally important to remember that we must help those who through no fault of their own cannot help themselves .
where was he during that debate in his campaign ?
this 36 th Parliament opens at a time when we have brought order to our public finances , and the economy is entering a period of strong growth .
on a very personal basis I hope it will be able to do in a different area for many thousands of young Canadians what my parents were able to do for me , my brothers and my sisters .
one of the central themes of the throne speech was the commitment to co - operation between various levels of government .
our program had six points , basically .
aboriginal PEOPLES
i am looking at the standing orders that were referred to by the hon. Leader of the Opposition and by the government House leader .
there are many ways to consult the public .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
Mr. Jerry Pickard :
one year later after extensive consultations , including 15 town hall meetings and 12 days of public hearings across the prairies , the panel completed its report and submitted it to the minister .
let us get serious .
perhaps it was a typo .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the comment from the member .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , all of these items are contrary to the rules of this place and I ask you please to enforce the rules of the House .
the Speaker :
that should be the model .
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew ( Secretary of State ( Children and Youth ) , Lib . ) :
they all rose as they did this afternoon and applauded the Minister of Finance .
never before , in a Speech from the Throne , has a government so directly threatened Quebec ' s right to decide on its own future .
before becoming a member of Parliament I made my living as an Atlantic playwright and film writer .
maybe we could get the support of the Reform Party in order to do more with the Canada child tax benefit .
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD
Mr. Speaker , I would really suggest that members of the Reform Party hire better researchers .
with team Canada we have improved our trade and investment performance but there is still much more that we must do to secure Canada ' s place in the global economy .
that is what it is .
in my own community , and I know the member will believe me when I say this , I have human capital , which is a very important thing to nurture , training and retraining .
we want to debate the merits of the bill through our amendments .
i am sure they will all do a wonderful job and do honour to this place .
* * *
we hope they will be carried out with all due diligence , but we will take the process seriously .
however , the most important decision , the biggest hurdle , will be to obtain a mandate from registered canola producers .
there is nothing unconstitutional about having five moral principles that are accepted throughout Canada , including Quebec , and as a result can be applied anywhere in Canada , both in the wealthiest and the less wealthy provinces .
* * *
this is the same sort of increase we had in spending during the 1970 s that got us into this whole problem in the first place .
the recent electoral tides in Atlantic Canada sent a signal that Atlantic Canadians were not simply frustrated with cuts but instead were frustrated with the lack of vision demonstrated by the government to the needs of Atlantic Canada .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a question of privilege .
the government must , with no further ado , reduce employment insurance to $ 2.20 per $ 100 of insurable earnings .
madam Speaker , I am not sure .
it demonstrates it every day .
ensuring the independence of the CPP investment board is a very important aspect of today ' s bill .
we the sovereignists are the defenders of democracy in Quebec .
however , there is a fly in the ointment .
party politics have no place in the managing of our Canadian forces .
whether the Liberals or the Conservatives are in power makes no difference .
i do not think the Liberals have moved on that promise .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Atlantic Canadians want a future where they have access to the free enterprise system and can utilize the tools of the free enterprise system to build a stronger , more self - reliant Atlantic Canada .
i am proud to be a member of a Parliament that , for the first time in 20 years , will see Canada achieve a balanced budget , a zero deficit , and eventually a surplus .
there were some examples :
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. John Cannis ( Scarborough Centre , Lib . ) :
it sounds very fishy indeed .
for example it was not clear then how many directors there would be .
we tabled it yesterday .
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) :
it will balance the budget no later than fiscal year 1998 - 99 .
in other parts of Canada the same thing is happening in the high tech industry .
there have been criticisms to which I would like to respond .
for most Canadians , however , these are significant changes .
* * *
parents are afraid that their rights and responsibilities to properly discipline their children are threatened by the direction the Liberal government is taking .
Mr. Allan Kerpan ( Blackstrap , Ref. ) :
may I draw members ' attention to citation 168 ( 5 ) of Beauchesne ' s sixth edition , at page 49 , which states " The Speaker will not give a decision upon a constitutional question nor decide a question of law '' .
we have made some important investments .
the CPP revenues are not revenues of the Government of Canada .
many times in the course of the give and take in the House of Commons certain words are used and sometimes , as your Speaker , they seem to be inappropriate .
some hon. members :
all schools were to be declared interdenominational schools but where numbers warranted people would have the right to retain their rights in the educational system of the province .
when it comes to the debate on the surplus , I want to say to my friend from Kelowna that we will be on opposite sides .
Canadians from across the country were impressed with the calibre of our athletes .
the Liberal Party of Canada ' s approach has failed , because it denies the existence of the people of Quebec people , a people different from the people of Canada .
the Government is committed to ensuring that Canada remains a place where Canadians feel secure in their homes and on the streets of their communities .
in between , they had their referendum on Charlottetown , which he forgot to mention , in which English Canada said no to Quebec because it was too much , and Quebec said no because it was not enough .
we spent a day together here in Ottawa discussing the issues of importance to that community .
they are remarkable .
i was there as a Canadian wishing to experience this vote in Quebec City .
some hon. members :
even more to the point , the government went to the people , who spoke in the last election .
representatives of the media also arrived at the building that afternoon , apparently at the invitation of the hon. member .
this is why he went into politics .
organized criminal activities are clearly a matter of growing concern for the police , the general public and the government .
today , we cannot afford to overlook certain realities .
if the fund is invested in the safest bet it will probably buy a lot of bank stock .
the hon. member for Berthier - Montcalm .
no human has done so much , for so many , for so little .
the range in representation goes from 33,639 in Prince Edward Island to 109,544 in B.C. Is this equality ?
* * *
Mr. Speaker , we now know that a close collaborator of the Liberal Party of Canada with responsibility for the Mauricie region in the last election may have had access to Department of Human Resources Development funding lists .
some people still believe in the grand schemes that call for massive amounts of tax dollars and assume that a handful of bureaucrats making decisions in central offices are somehow superior to the choices made by ordinary Canadians .
i firmly believe that we are on track , that we are making progress and that we are well equipped to handle both the challenges and the opportunities which lie ahead .
i supported it as a member of the yes committee in the last attempt in Oxford county .
the modern tools of economic development are ones which we have to focus on and to ensure that aboriginal people have access to the resources that have made this country great .
i say " candidates " because at the party level , it was another story .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) moved :
government ORDERS
i urge its adoption as it reflects public expectation of the law .
i listened earlier to one of the members on the other side .
thank you for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you today .
as a former educator I have worked closely with students .
my constituents - and I know I speak for a vast number of Canadians - have recently been greatly disturbed by the comments of an unelected member of the Senate , Pat Carney .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
i know from my fellow colleagues on this side of the House that we have already done this .
the Bloc Quebecois has not forgotten that the federal research councils sustained cuts of close to $ 100 million , or 10 to 14 percent of their budget , and that funding for health and post - secondary education was slashed by $ 3.3 billion , with a direct negative impact on research in these two sectors .
ultimately it will have an impact on the decisions they will make with regard to where they want to work .
the Speaker :
Mr. Jim Abbott
they want a better pension plan and a better tax system .
from what we have seen in recent polls taken in Quebec and in the co - operation shown across this country in areas such as child care and health care , this country can work .
we know the government with all its machinery can get bills drafted in a day if it wants to present them in the House .
Mr. Speaker , for my clarification , could the Speaker advise the House whether a motion which says " to decline " or a motion not to do something is in order .
the hon. leader of the opposition .
these are numbers that exist .
Mr. Speaker , as I indicated before , I am open to considering how we can ensure greater consultation as I go about making recommendations for appointments to the Supreme Court of Canada .
i agree with everything she said , for instance , about poverty among aboriginal people in Canada , about health , suicide and so on .
yeas
when they are free of political interference , the ideas are good .
let us find out what is really rotten in the state of Denmark .
under the existing legislation , one must have worked during at least four out of the past six years to be eligible for CPP disability benefits .
how can the minister play saviour and announce such a fund worth $ 1 billion without blushing , when his cuts to education , which will amount to $ 10 billion , have put students in debt like never before ?
however , if anyone should be aware of these inequities , it is the Liberal majority , because some of those who were here in the last Parliament , especially from the maritimes , and I am thinking of the Minister of Defence , are no longer here today .
he declared that he never received contributions from businesses .
i am far from agreeing with everything that is in that report but we cannot as a country remain in denial in dealing with what is going to be one of the most important issues of the next century , an issue that will test our values .
it was then passed on to Montreal , because the Canadian department of human resources development projects have to be approved in Montreal by Quebec division .
all proceeds from sales less the marketing costs are then passed back to farmers .
we appreciate the fact that he thinks this is important and we want to move ahead in that area .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :

the Deputy Speaker :
i have raised the issue of CPP disability before .
Mr. Grant Hill
i have three sons in their 20 s and I am concerned about their future the same as all parents care about the future of their children .

routine PROCEEDINGS
i have given my account of what I think happened in 1982 .
the leader of the Reform Party was the one who indicated that if he moved into Stornoway he would put a Bingo sign on it .
we have always worked with Canadians to find solutions to our problems .
Mr. Speaker , I have a second petition with 25 names of residents from the Campbell River area .
through the government ' s youth employment strategy we can provide them with the information , services and support they need .
obviously I could not be here without their approval and support .
my government feels the burden of that moral force in all that we do .
most important , this issue was debated by Canadians themselves .
first the farm organization representing the producers of that commodity must make a written request for the inclusion .
last week I listened very carefully to my first throne speech .
our first ministers are among those who share this frustration .
i am asking her to push her government a bit , give it a little jolt to get its heart working a bit .
Mr. Ted White
a number of Kitchener area businesses which were represented on that mission have benefited from increased international demand .
there is a long journey .

Mr. Speaker , 25 years ago this week Dr. Tom Bolton discovered the first evidence of black holes while working at the David Dunlap Observatory , University of Toronto , located in Richmond Hill .
i could go on and on citing the ills of our society as the reasons why so many people have become apathetic and cynical .
first of all , the multiplier the formula applied here affects the expenditures in a different way .
i am aware there are Quebeckers and Ontarians .
it was a Canadian who won two gold medals for speed skating at the Olympic games .

certainly , regulation is required .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
i have to tell the House that I wanted to see the Speech from the Throne talk about citizenship , getting rid of the monarchy and a number of other things .
we do recognize that the disadvantaged in Canada and the poor in Canada need assistance .
the mandate of the Canada pension trust and its trustees would be to advise the government on how and where to invest the money , on contribution levels , and on how to select the best private sector managers acceptable in industry to administer the fund .
our government thinks that the best way to offset job losses in slower growth areas is to encourage the creation of more new jobs in emerging sectors .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
the minister has repeatedly denied these allegations .
our government ' s continued commitment to young Canadians , to innovation , to trade and rural development are the cornerstones to ensure a strong and prosperous future for the riding of Perth - Middlesex .
hon. Jean J . Charest :
i did not see anything that speaks to Canadians working hard to harvest , maintain and make a living by their wits and by their sweat the bounty of Canada ' s natural resources .
Mr. Jim Hart
young people in Quebec have always believed in the political action of the people of Quebec in its history .
following this horrendous act of interference into the judicial independence of Judge Jerome , justice department officials sought to minimize the damage by deliberately creating a false scenario designed to mislead defence counsel and Canadians into believing that Ted Thompson has approached Chief Justice Isaac for the innocent purpose of discussing the scheduling of 12 future deportation cases and had inadvertently discussed the three deportation cases being handled by Judge Jerome .
now the Liberals are wondering why there are so many poor families .
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ :
although my hometown of North Bay is not far from here , each time I fly here I pass directly over the place of my youth .
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT
i am immensely grateful to my constituents for electing me to this 36 th Parliament .
in early September he requested views from farm organizations on the appropriate principles to govern the election of the directors .
i come from Peace River in northwestern Alberta and I can understand the difficulties in representing a riding of that size .
the first assumption is that if there is a problem then the answer must be that government has to intervene .
is there any indication in the throne speech that this government accepted and heeded the message sent by the Canadian people ?
on behalf of my party here , our deepest sympathy goes out to Mr. Knowles ' family .
Mr. Speaker , if the hon. member of the Reform Party is so proud to welcome immigrants to Canada , he should not really be continuing to try to create myths about immigration .
of course we will have suggestions of activities to submit to the government , and we may even perhaps send an invitation to the head of state of the next country to come celebrate the new millennium with us in Quebec .
if there are two people working that is $ 1,400 , over $ 100 a month .
we absolutely must have a public pension plan so that opportunities at the time of retirement are as equal as possible .
it is triumphant , carefully disguising the fact that we can expect at least $ 42 billion more in cuts between now and the year 2001 .
the hon. member for Elk Island .
i feel obliged to remind them that all of us here are representatives of different regions of the country , co - owners of all that we have .
in its throne speech , the government makes a commitment : it is as if it was wondering just how it could keep on doing exactly the same thing it has been doing for the past 27 years while appearing to be doing something new .
for many of us it was absolutely galling to read the Speech from the Throne and the statement " we will legislate to put back , to increase funds for the Canada health care system to the tune of $ 12.5 billion '' .
an exchange of letters ensued in which Thompson outlined the chronology of the court delays on the three cases .

marriage ( PROHIBITED DEGREES ) ACT
however there are no details about how and when the Liberals plan to do this .
not only did the government consult widely with Canadians , it also sat down with the provinces .
we have been doing this since the 1970 s when we started to change UI benefits to make them regionally sensitive .
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron :
if I consult the Government of Quebec , I can certainly consult the Government of Canada ' s minister responsible for the region .

Mr. Preston Manning

Mr. Speaker , if it is possible to be a people within a province like the province of Quebec , it is most certainly possible to be a people within the province of Alberta .
the Speaker :
just as I am disappointed that they did not mention Windsor , Tecumseh and St. Clair Beach , the virtual centre of the universe , I am sure he is disappointed that his towns were not mentioned specifically either .

i would like to quote some advice I read on February 10 of this year .
we have been told that the deficit will exceed $ 17 billion , $ 24 billion , and so on , when they know very well on the other side of the House with their panoply of specialists and their good judgment , if they have any , that the budget and deficit figures are very different from what is being touted .
to insinuate otherwise by calling the rate increase in contributions a tax grab is misleading and confusing .
Ms. Judi Longfield :
people in my part of Canada are still seething over that legislation .
Mr. Speaker , one fact remains .
we need to reinvest in the priorities .
all those opposed will please say nay .
innovation and the economic growth that it generates is not produced by any particular program but by fostering a society that encourages innovation and change .
employment insurance , as it is now known , is a measure that is almost completely inaccessible .
Suncor Energy for example , a company with oil sands operations in my riding , has released its third annual progress report on Canada ' s climate change voluntary challenge and registry program in which it states that in compliance with commitments made in the Rio accord , it is on track to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 .

i say to my Bloc colleagues that this was not passed without the consent of Quebeckers , at least in so far as those of us from outside Quebec perceived it at the time .
* * *
we must continue to ensure the long term health of Canada and at the same time we should make sure we put in place partnerships to ensure that Canada ' s arts organizations and artists have a chance to continue to promote and develop the ideas , hopes and aspirations of all Canadians .
in February of this year , the Minister of Finance introduced in this House the first version of the legislation on the Canada pension plan .
perhaps the announcement of a fund , which the Prime Minister had to make outside the throne speech , will in some way resolve what is felt generally - that as far as young people are concerned , the speech rings hollow .
our examination then indicated that the passports were forgeries .
i am convinced that this 36 th Parliament will go down in history .
my colleague talks a lot about the deficit .
call in the members .
Mr. Speaker , Lucien Bouchard ' s economic mission is drawing to a close .
it was silent on conditional sentencing .
Mr. Speaker , the member asked this question yesterday and I responded .
should we cut taxes here or there or should we drop a little into our programs ?
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Public Works .
i am , as you know , a servant of this House .
the petitioners from Etobicoke - Lakeshore call on Parliament to remove the GST from books , magazines and newspapers and to remove all federal sales tax from reading .
that does not say that life is going to be great for people .
this should be a top priority if we are a caring and decent country .
we must continue to work to make sure that every yesterday is a vibrant and beautiful dream of happiness and every tomorrow is a magnificent vision of hope .
it is emphasizing the equality of the people of Canada as well as the equality of its partners , the provinces .
a system such as the individual transfer quotas or ITQs have taken 50 percent of the total quotas away from individual fishers and moved them into the hands of a handful of corporations .
surely the Liberals would have mentioned it there and I would not have missed it .
they have been analysed , debated and critiqued for four years .
it looked at the results of those hearings and certainly moved that issue forward .
Mr. John Maloney :
the Beauce region , along with the Chaudi 猫 re - Appalaches region , has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Quebec , 6.1 per cent in August of this year .
when we started the government was spending $ 120 billion on programs a year .
Canadians want their government to work in partnership .
during my parents ' time , Inuit used fox tags and wooden sticks to trade for supplies .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to inform this House that I have been given confirmation that an investigation is indeed under way , and that ministers of the current government might be directly or indirectly involved .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
Mr. Speaker , the members of the Conservative Party with little to say are interested in points of order .
hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew
( 17 ) to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts
Canadians overwhelmingly support the single payer publicly financed system of providing health services across Canada .
i will try to remember to mention that at the end of my speech as well .
the Speaker :
what is appropriate for Quebec may not necessarily be appropriate for Alberta or Ontario or vice versa .
for the information of the House it is now in Bill C - 4 and we are very pleased that grains are being included as opposed to being excluded .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau :
Mr. Speaker , if the hon. member has anything substantial rather than rhetoric and cheap political points she is trying to make she should table it in the House right now instead of making these types of accusations which are incorrect and not true .
the predictable and unfortunate consequences of this tight money economic policy have been chronic levels of long term unemployment and spiralling compounding interest on our national debt .
since the Prime Minister does not , when it comes down to it , know all that much about how Brian Tobin and his colleagues are going to hold their consultations on the Calgary declaration , how can he use that consultation , whose methodology he does not know , as a pretext , in a major speech , to make yet another threat against Quebec ?
i do not accept the claim that Newfoundland will be left behind by this government which has been standing very well for all regions of the country .
madam Speaker , I am a bit surprised by the motion today .
i would like to start by congratulating you , Mr. Speaker , for your appointment to the Chair and also the hon. Minister of Natural Resources for his appointment , the minister that I will be critiquing in this Parliament .
they wanted someone who would be outspoken at the appropriate time on minority rights .
i think that , with the developments in public finances , it is not too late for the Minister of Finance to do the right thing .
the minister responsible for the wheat board has listened to the concerns of western farmers and has answered their calls for a more responsive , accountable and accessible wheat board .
* * *
the community meetings would be assisted by facilitators , information provided by provincial governments , input from experts and include the participation of local MLAs and MPPs .
we have begun working with provincial governments to develop a national children ' s agenda to improve the well - being of Canada ' s children .
the throne speech reinforced this first historic misunderstanding .
in particular the number of seniors will escalate dramatically when the baby boom generation starts to retire .
Mr. Speaker , I wish to pay tribute to His Excellency the Governor General , Mr. Rom 茅 o LeBlanc , and to thank him for giving the throne speech before both Houses .
the municipality is home to 450 businesses and is impacted greatly by the Holland Marsh , the heart of Canada ' s vegetable industry , the salad bowl of Ontario .
this has a very negative effect on all the other students .
we got out of tourism .
Chet MacRae would want to be remembered as an ordinary Canadian who served his country well .
we have had eight hours of debate and already the government has moved closure .
i congratulate Berg ' s chairman Lorne Berggren and its president Don Berggren on their achievements .
the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ' s rule of thumb is , if you do not know it , make it up .
we are all waiting anxiously to find out .
this is not an academic exercise .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Jim Gouk
i feel privileged to represent the constituents of Kings - Hants .
there were two motions by the opposition refusing to send the legislation to committee to be studied by members of Parliament .
it is a great honour and privilege to be here .
i am trying to get any facts that I can .
how does the Minister of Transport explain the fact that mayor of Montreal himself said he met with the Prime Minister to discuss the Dorval issue , and a settlement was reached with Ottawa ' s help ?
hon. Andy Scott
we are all the same .
the Whitby Warriors are coached by Jim Bishop whose involvement in the sport of lacrosse spans some 51 years .
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia )
i have been told that if we could give businesses a tax break , they would hire more people , they would reinvest in their businesses , they would expand and they would start new enterprises .
will the minister commit today to making the necessary changes to the Employment Insurance Act to put an end to the unfair treatment of seasonal and part time workers in the Atlantic region , in Quebec and across Canada ?
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
we must also come to the defence of the universal public pension system .
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
they should have to go to the people every four or five years and present themselves as candidates so that when they speak in every region of this country they will have to answer to the people , as we have to answer to the people .
let the police do their work before making frivolous accusations .
i wish to stress that I am in no way finding fault with the existing staff .
i do not want a debate to go back and forth .
it was a 30 day referendum in which he decided the court case was over .
during the entire time when the Conservatives were in office , the Liberal Party , which was the official opposition at the time , acted outraged over all these scandals and strongly condemned the government .
all I can do is quote one of my constituents .
i hope that we are able to see many more of these emotional discussions .
the member says that Reform has no plan to deal with the unfunded liability of $ 600 billion .
when I look at my own riding of Essex I know that each day in the paper there is a high demand for mould makers and skilled trade .
universities have already expressed their views on the matter by demanding this particular selection process , peer evaluation , without receiving any guarantees in that regard .
of course we will be in a position to do more in terms of social spending as our commitment to sound fiscal management yields larger and larger dividends .
hon. David Anderson
our loose laws are encouraging people to break the law , especially male young offenders who steal over half the cars stolen in Canada , mostly to joy ride and experience a thrill at someone else ' s expense .
the member opposite has already been provided with a personal briefing on the MAI , as were all critics .
these citizens of Canada support retention of section 43 of the Criminal Code which states " every schoolteacher , parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child who is under his care if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances '' .
Canadians want value for their tax money .
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire :
in brief , to do the job , each member requires the tools .
i would argue that in some part it is due to the fact that we have tremendously high taxes in this country .
the role of government is to respond to the needs of Canadians , to make life better for Canadians .
i go back to the Tories because it is basically the same group , only different faces .
this has to do in my view with a party matter as opposed to another matter .
therefore , this bill seeks to protect , under certain circumstances , the integrity and the safety of those who testify in criminal proceedings .
the Reform Party has done an incredible job at trying to smear and broad brush all aboriginal frustrations on the basis of a very few .
Mr. Speaker , the first step is to deepen and increase the resources available for the government ' s program of industrial research assistance of the National Research Council , winner of the prestigious Ernest C . Manning Award and a program which is at the forefront of helping small business develop and commercialize technology .
let us be open and honest about this .
fortunately for me it has done so once again .
they are not being fooled one little bit .
health care and education are top priorities for Canadians yet the current government ' s plans to cut cash transfers for these vital programs by 40 percent while barely touching its own program spending is unacceptable .
we must build for our children a country in which they can grow and develop without going hungry and without lacking quality health care , in a context that will encourage them to excel .
Mr. Speaker , that is certainly our objective .
i know this hon. member wants to pretend he is a rat packer , but he is certainly no Brian Tobin .
this Liberal government is not representing the wishes of its constituents by and large .
there are those who favour doing away completely with the Canadian Wheat Board .
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
unfortunately , it was just wishful thinking .
it is so ironic .
there is no support from the farmers we have talked to .
mining
Mr. Keith Martin
still on the subject of the social restructuring in this bill , I would point out certain facts that will shed a little light on what appears to be a government sacrifice , but which in fact a sham .
i want to know what the government is doing to bring down internal trade barriers in this country .
the city is well represented internationally by companies like Albarrie , Yachiyo , Canplas and Alloy Wheels .
the time has come .
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Paul Bonwick
each generation has the opportunity to choose the society it wants to leave for its children .
these people were brought in from other countries because we did not have the skills to fill these jobs .
we know that small businesses in Canada are stressed with payroll deductions , but now they must face yet another hike in expenses .
how can the Minister of Human Resources Development support such a bad so - called investment for Canadians ?
does their proposal contemplate that scenario ?
what is tax relief as opposed to a social benefit that is delivered through the taxation system ?
so , do not try to appeal to our emotions .
they were all cancelled by the premier .
we chose the balanced approach and we found lo and behold after our commitments in 1993 and 1997 that the balanced approach does indeed work .
Mr. Speaker , I ask that all questions be allowed to stand .
Mr. Speaker , in June 1994 , six months after we took office , we introduced a new system in which contracting was open and everybody had a chance .
every billion dollars in new investment creates 45,000 jobs over five years .
we do not want to duplicate that in the other provinces .
i was pleased to see in the throne speech that there was some recognition given to the impact which the technological revolution and the information age is having on our society and the world .
he has a very difficult job ahead to convince his cabinet and his caucus colleagues to develop a new vision for the industry that will keep pace with the vision that is being developed out in the real world by the farmers .
is he saying that the film industry of Nova Scotia should not get any assistance ?
it is just a normal thing that we accept .
the armouries is on the way out .
it claims to recognize it has a contribution to make to job creation and economic growth .
our youth are another group that will be affected by the proposed legislation put forth by the government .
our movies , books , magazines , plays , videos , music , and multi - media productions speak to us about our experiences at the same time as they present Canadian creativity to the world .
the Deputy Speaker :
i am not privy to all the details , of course , because I was not there .
what will they do about using the processes we have in place to settle disputes ?
the bidding is escalating at the expense of Quebecers .
therefore , the main philosophy behind the CPP is to divert part of today ' s national economic output into a decent retirement fund for people when they retire .
it was the wise course to take and the right thing to have done .
he was fair .
the government introduced a preliminary bill in February 1997 , followed by a revised bill last July .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
that involves education , planning and practice .
our family spent nearly two years before the courts .
the Speaker :
before entering this House in 1993 I spent my entire professional career in education .
the member talks about a crack .
i ask the government to listen to industry and consumers and remove excessive bureaucracy and the regulatory quagmire within the communications industry so that Canadians can set the standard for the world during the communications century .
we as members of the 36 th Parliament will be given a privilege never afforded to any of our predecessors .
he probably was in hibernation all that time .
under the Reform proposal , the next generation or two of Canadians would have to pay twice , once for their own pensions and again for pensions of those who are already retired .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
the government has cut the last post fund for veterans from $ 26,000 to $ 12,060 .
we are more competitive as a nation .
worse still , that person even went so far as to give advice to the human resources director on how to cover up the misappropriation of funds , because this is what it is .
canada ELECTIONS ACT
that is the hand up the Government of Canada and Human Resources Development Canada are prepared to give them .
i am proud to have been instrumental last year in ensuring that a half century later , at their 50 th reunion , these veterans finally got the certificates they deserved .
for the first three years the board ' s domestic equity investment will be selected passively , meaning that the board will mirror one of the more broad market indexes instead of picking individual securities .
these characteristics are exhibited today by new Canadians , people who continue to come to this country from all over the world to become citizens of Canada in order to build strong futures for themselves and for their children .
but there are important ways in which the federal government can assist as well .
i acknowledge that luxury car sales are up .
is this a healthy system ?
business OF THE HOUSE
both parties know that they have to bargain in a most earnest situation .
i regret having to interrupt the hon. member .
and might I urge you , Mr. Speaker , and your colleagues to use your experience and your authority to make this House a place in which the debate will be as vigorous as it is courteous , but also a forum that the public will hold in esteem rather than contempt .
they welcome and support the latest initiatives of the government on the unity file .
we will maintain it .
it is an absolute tragedy that someone had to die before we saw recommendations from the Transportation Safety Board being put into place .
i can also inform the hon. member that Mr. Levy indicated the Israeli government has undertaken to investigate the matter and clear up all questions which have arisen between Canada and Israel .
amendments proposed by the federal government were approved by at least two thirds of provinces representing two thirds of the Canadian public , as required by law .
privilege
but in the hearts of those who live there and of the 3.5 million who visit our community each year , Niagara - on - the - Lake is and will always be the most beautiful town in the world .
on the one hand , they want the deficit eliminated .

as the negotiations approach the deadline for completion in the coming year , the scope of consultations will be broadened to include additional NGOs , especially those concerned with labour and environment issues .
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay :
statements BY MEMBERS
if they fail in that duty they will expose themselves to legal liability .
Canadians have a right to expect their governments to work together in harmony to better meet the shared goals and desires of Canadians for a better health system .
- veterans Affairs , Votes 1 , 5 and 10
i am concerned about that and the political support a public pension plan will receive .
it could be so much better .
Mr. Wayne Easter :
bill C - 237 .
so I am very familiar with the Inuit culture .
Mr. Charlie Power
thank you , Paul .
he was never too busy to help a newcomer learn the ropes .
the hon. member must realize that the consultation process carried out by the premier of Newfoundland has to do with a policy statement which has no constitutional impact and which only involves that particular province , for the time being .
how peculiar .
yet , the level of unemployment among Canadians between the ages of 18 and 25 is unacceptably high .
could the Minister of Human Resources Development tell us what his government has against Canadians who work , who want to work and who want peace of mind and security in retirement ?
he performed his duties with dignity , wisdom and an unequalled sense of humour .
the speech provides a clear outline of where the government intends to dedicate its efforts and most importantly , it unveiled an agenda that responds well to the suggestions and aspirations voiced by the residents of Vaughan - King - Aurora .
does the hon. member opposite acknowledge the existence of the people of Quebec ? To work together , we must first be who we are .
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
the only Quebeckers affected by the CPP are those who have paid CPP premiums , whether they live in Quebec or decide to move there , as well as members of the Canadian Armed Forces and the RCMP .
the Leader of the Bloc Quebecois in Ottawa changed party three times .
to deal with the past , a forensic audit is being completed by KPMG , looking at the band ' s records and the records of my department to ensure things have been managed appropriately .
the RCMP is doing its job .
committee chairs should have the resources to arrange his or her own experts on staff .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
this Liberal government is implementing the single largest tax grab in the history of Canada .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday I attended a memorial service honouring those law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty .
Homecoming '98 will give the local economy a significant boost , but just as important , it will instil a renewed sense of civic pride in all Saultites past and present .
in its plan we would forget the working poor family , the spouse who for one reason or another had to stay home to take of children .
my concern is that the Chair consider , before seeing whoever it is who will be moving the motion on behalf of the government - we have notice that the motion will be moved - not seeing the mover of the motion as a way of using the power of the Chair to intervene on behalf of members of Parliament , both collectively and individually , in a situation where our right to adequate debate is being violated by the government ' s rush to judgment on the appropriateness of time allocation .
we cannot allow rural regions of the country to suffer from a lack of technology while urban regions prosper .
wheat made possible the building of Canada ' s first transcontinental railway , and I sometimes think the construction of the CPR was the last major effort on the part of this dominion government relative to the prairies .
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) :
the government is firmly committed to not only the five principles of the Canada Health Act but to working with our partners in the provinces , with providers and with other stakeholders in the system to restore the health system to the quality Canadians expect and deserve .
once again , we have been trying to negotiate with the union to get a fair settlement .
that is the way it has always been , that is the way it will always be .
finally , I want to congratulate former New Democratic Party members Vic Althouse and Len Taylor who worked very hard in the committee prior to the election being called to establish some of these major changes on behalf of the wheat board , on behalf of farmers throughout Canada .
i did not know exactly where the member was going in his statement , but as a general rule we do not criticize specifically members of the other House .
ASIA CONNECTS YOUTH CONFERENCE
it has been a long time since this country has been at such a tremendous juncture in its history .
first in relation to the blood system , we all await the delivery of the Krever report .
is the hon. member proud of the cuts to education , the regular hikes in tuition fees , which led not to increased access to education , but to increased difficulty obtaining an education in the case of those who have little money ?
Mr. Ken Epp
those are the kind of silly rules we have in Canada .
madam Speaker , my colleague talked a lot about the government having to cut in order to balance the books in some way .
in a free market system like Canada , the private sector has always operated under budget constraints .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I need to challenge the hon. member .
if CPP does not exist in the same way , what would an insurance policy cost to replace those benefits ?
i do not have Mr. Harder , the advisory board chairman , in my riding but I was interested in what kind of accountability and prestige he had in his riding .
Mr. Speaker , this bill would put an end to a process that has been taking place over the years .
as new members in the House will soon learn , this House is not a place for the most part where we carry out the will of the people .
indeed , after making inquiries and asking the RCMP to do so , I of course told the leader of the Quebec wing , the President of the Treasury Board and the Minister of Public Works , because when such allegations are made , it is extremely important that those who are in a position of authority be informed , so they can act as quickly as I did .
what is wrong with that ?
it must go to the whole band .
many of us benefited from them , including perhaps the hon. member .
in Etobicoke - Lakeshore there are many seniors who have written , who have spoken with me and who have attended consultation meetings where we discussed the changes and the need for changes to the Canada pension plan .
Ms. Diane St - Jacques :
hon. Anne McLellan
i am fortunate to be able to represent a riding that is as diverse , as rich and as meaningful to Canada .
it is not up to me to approve or disapprove of it , that is up to his legislature .
with just one point of view heard
yet there are many indications that Canadians do not feel safe and that is a reality to which governments must respond .
we lose all kinds of very highly qualified people to the United States and other countries around the world because the personal income tax burden drives them away .
some hon. members :
this means 900,000 jobs or 6.9 per cent of total employment .
would the minister also inform the House as to the measures the government will implement to avoid such deplorable situations in the future ?
the architects of the plan promised Canadians that contributions would never exceed 5.5 percent .
we have made a commitment that very soon the country will be in a position to operate with a surplus .
they are going to be affected .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his questions .
liberal PARTY OF CANADA
at that summit the heads of government promised an all - out effort to improve the quality of life for children .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
* * *
this means that those who are rich have to help those who are poor .
hon. David Anderson
the Speaker :
i reread the throne speech and I saw no reference at all to the multibillion dollar purchase of helicopters .
it will introduce legislation to increase to $ 12.5 billion a year the guaranteed annual cash payments to provinces and territories under the Canada Health and Social Transfer .
one of the four businesses mixed up in the present situation and under investigation by the RCMP is the Raglan mining company located in my riding .
Mr. Norman Doyle :
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) :
i would ask that the people of Quebec insist that their voices be joined with the millions of other Canadians who will soon be discussing Canada ' s constitutional future .
we also understand that if we want to sustain and we want to maintain programs that help people in a way that ensures equality , we have to take decisions that are sometimes tough decisions .
Mr. Speaker , in the throne speech , the government claims to be sensitive to the problems of low income families with children and the problems in the education and health case systems .
yet yesterday in the throne speech we did not hear the word equality even once ; uniqueness , diversity , all kinds of words , but not equality .
that is money that could have benefited our health care system .
in Ontario sending people home from hospital quicker and sicker is what seems to be rewarded .
finally , in connection with Bill C - 4 , I wanted to mention an agricultural initiative in my riding , the Coop 茅 rative Grains D ' OR .
we all know that is the case .
Ms. Susan Whelan
if we talk to ordinary people in bands like the Stoney , the Siksika , the Kwanlin Dun , the Samson Cree , the Shushwap and on and on , they will tell us where the money is gone .
members of the Bloc Quebecois will continue to stand by the democratic traditions of Lester B . Pearson ' s Canada .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mrs. Nancy Karetak - Lindell
it is with a very definite purpose in mind that I begin my answer with these words .
we stated that when the books are balanced and when we find ourselves in a budgetary surplus then we will split whatever budgetary surplus is there 50:50 within our fiscal framework .
the more borrowed money we spend on social programs , in the long run the more money we send to financial institutions and deprive it from being available for social programs .
we think there has to be an increase in CPP contribution levels to rates that are adequate to ensure the long term viability of the plan .
what is at the end of the arm ?
when he decided to call his referendum , term 17 , a new term to be enshrined in the Constitution of Canada , was released to the public 16 hours before the advanced polls opened .
this time the purpose of the investment in our future will be to reduce barriers to access post - secondary education .
this perhaps has contributed to the fact that the report is that one child in every five is living in poverty , that we have an aboriginal lady who has to live in a van in Alberta on one of the richest reserves in Canada .
i have discussed the problem many times with President Chirac .
what about our priorities on health care , education , youth and children ?
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) :
bill C - 2 .
* * *
we will miss Frank .
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) :
did people from the Liberal Party of Canada in our area directly or indirectly take part in these practices , were they in contact with Mr. Corbeil , did they also share this information ?
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
it says that hundreds of thousands of seniors in the future will receive fewer benefits .
a recent book entitled Youthquake by an up and coming young Canadian , Ezra Levant , cites a survey that shows over 30 percent of Canadians under 39 years of age do not believe they will receive a Canada pension plan pension at all despite the assurances from the government and from politicians .
* * *
* * *
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
it is a win - win situation .
less well known perhaps is our rich cultural ethnic diversity in Halifax and Nova Scotia generally .
that moral force comes from what we are , what we have done together and what values we share in common .
most important , Bill C - 4 contains an inclusion clause .
Mr. Speaker , this member of Parliament , who has just arrived here , as we all know , is one of the foremost experts in the country on the whole issue of tax reform .
therefore the judge granted an injunction to make sure their rights got back on track again .
victims continue to have to relive the memory of their violent loss through early parole applications .
we have seen allegations and actually substantive proof and convictions in other provinces of influence peddling and of patronage , whether it is constituency patronage or politicians doing things for money provided to them by sources other than the taxpayers .
we have placed our priorities .
now blue skies and nice folks are important , but I suggest they are not the only reason that companies invest in Canada .
in our safe communities agenda we focus on crime prevention at the community level which is essentially a process of community building with local involvement over a wide range of issues .
so what is the answer ?
we have altered hydrological cycles and changed the earth ' s climate .
during my election campaign I made it very clear to the voters that I would not make any promises that I could not keep and that in fact the only promise I would make was that to the best of my abilities I would work hard both with and on behalf of my constituents to ensure that their voice is heard in Ottawa in this great Chamber , the hallmark of our democratic system of government .
members should forget about their own benefits for a moment and think about their grandchildren .
we have a long way to go .
in my opinion , the word " stealing " is unparliamentary ; I would therefore ask my hon. colleague to withdraw it .
people in my riding frequently refer to three major concerns and priorities : first , the need for the economy to generate more jobs so that more Canadians , in particular young Canadians , can re - enter the workforce ; second , the need to resolve our national unity problem so that we can move forward and remove the last major impediment to economic growth in Ontario , Quebec and the rest of Canada ; and third , the need to restore confidence in our health care system .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise to debate Bill C - 2 , an act to amend the Canada pension plan .
our strength , our character and our recent successes have positioned us to pursue those opportunities in new ways to meet new challenges of a new century .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
in the current context of this House , the throne speech is said to outline the vision of the new government .
a better investment policy is vital to preserving the CPP .
we are vitally concerned as a party and as Canadians about this important area of Canadian society and Canadian life .
highways
i want to tell the House that we will never again allow the finances of the country to get out of control .
agreed .
i missed it because the interpreter spoke too quickly .
it moves me deeply to learn that over 150 years ago , when religion and race caused wars everywhere else in the world , here in Canada Robert Baldwin resigned his seat in the Parliament of the United Canada ' s so that his colleague , Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine , could run in a seat in the heart of English Canada .
he also touched upon the history of the Liberal Party .
Mr. Speaker , if the NDP members want to preserve the Canada pension plan then why will they not let it go to committee where there can be debate ?
however , I am going to limit my remarks to Quebec ' s Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement .
to those people I want to reiterate my sincerest thanks and I want to confirm that I intend to serve them with the utmost dedication and energy .
universities and hospitals are already having to cope with budget cuts , imposed by the cuts in transfer payments in particular .
he was an honest man , respectful of and respected by his political opponents .
this is not just nasty separatists , or nasty members of the Bloc Quebecois saying so .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe :
is Reform worried that there will be an examination of its own alternative ?
health
Ms. Val Meredith :
the true vision and values of Canadians are Liberal values .
we will continue to do this on a regular basis .
i am very proud to be part of a government that talks in the throne speech about investment spending and investment in people .
this is yet another reform that served present generations in the past , but that will be inaccessible to my generation in the future .
this initiative has created a vehicle with which our area is able to compete in a global economy .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
and the House being returned to the Commons chamber .
could he repeat it ?
Mr. Pierre de Savoye
i have problems with what we will be doing to those people who want to exercise that right , and there are many who want to do so .
Mr. Speaker , I will be brief .
here is what one of many investors , namely the president of Intrawest , said " I am not concerned at all by the political climate as I announce $ 500 million in investments at Mont Tremblant '' .
we can help in the delivery of the system to assist with child poverty .
as the Reform is prone to do , he has addressed in his comments specifically the financial end of his impression of the throne speech pointing out the inadequacies , making thoughtful suggestions on where improvements could be made .
it has been brought to the attention of politicians of every stripe by every member of Parliament to come from my island .
think about that .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question .
that is why I stand in my place and support this bold move to save this cherished covenant with working Canadians .
in the government ' s own report it has predicted it is going to double very shortly .
as I listened to it in the Senate , last Tuesday , I could not help but be disappointed by a government program with so little vision , by a speech lacking consistency , apparently designed to lead us into the next century .
that all opposition motions on allotted days in the said period may be motions that shall come to a vote , provided that not more than three of the said motions shall be included in the calculations for three supply periods as provided for in section ( 16 ) of Standing Order 81 :
Mr. Speaker , I wish to thank my hon. colleague .
is that what my colleague pretends is foolish , inappropriate , insensitive , wasteful spending ?
when it was set up back in 1966 the economy was different .
how does he expect a company in the northern outreaches of Newfoundland or in the outskirts of Nova Scotia to compete with those companies in central Canada when their markets are so far away ?
as much as we are creating jobs , there are other people being laid off .
he was a wonderful builder of Parliament and a real cornerstone of the House of Commons .
where is our criminal check and record of parole conditions ?
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
there is also no commitment to a national highway system despite the fact that this government enjoys $ 5 billion per annum from gasoline taxes .
the company which requested Mr. Cochrane ' s assistance was seeking advice on creating a new product line and improving efficiency and profit .
i can tell the House from personal experience that the reverse happened during the flood in Manitoba .
how can ordinary Canadians have faith in the government ' s tendering process when being a Liberal is obviously the first qualification checked ?
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
if we listen to the Reform Party and its friends at the C . D . Howe Institute or the Fraser Institute , we would think that the CPP is going to be flat broke and that we cannot afford it , that it has to be abolished .
CANADIAN PENSION PLAN
Ms. Karen Redman :
i remind members opposite that Ontario is experiencing the consequences of transferring power , that is the power to control the responsibility for social housing .
the ideas are good , they are all good , but the speech did not have what I was looking for .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
i want the government to listen to the message it got from the last election .
Mr. Speaker , the safety of air transportation continues to be the Government of Canada ' s priority .
funds needed immediately to pay benefits are loaned to the provinces at the federal government ' s long term bond rate , which is slightly below the provinces ' own cost of borrowing from financial markets .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
they are guaranteed under the Constitutional Act , 1867 and 1982 .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
he was in the process of telling us something he could never finish .
your appointment as Deputy Speaker reflects the respect in which you are held on all sides of the House .
he reminds me of his father .
if I am required to get the entire band ' s permission , then surely the bureaucrat would not be allowed to give just a handful of people that information .
the bottom line is that Canada is now on a track toward eliminating the deficit with a smaller and better government .
the Speaker :
in view of the increase in acts of terrorism and senseless violence in Algeria that have left more than 60,000 victims in recent years , according to Amnesty International estimates , Quebec , Canada and the international community must echo the voices of the bereaved families by utterly condemning the use of violence and seeking a political solution to the Algerian crisis .
he talked a little about that , about the aspirations he had in representing his people here .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom
Mr. Janko Peric ( Cambridge , Lib . ) :
that is what I think is happening .
these particular issues were either beyond the scope of the latest CPP statutory review , or they may have been raised too late or after consultations were complete .
audio - VISUAL PRODUCTION
even now , with the demand from the National Assembly , Quebec is looking for an accommodation , without recognizing the Constitution , which was the result of a process from which it was excluded .
Ms. Paddy Torsney ( Burlington , Lib . ) :
i look forward to working with the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , the Interim Commissioner of Nunavut , the president of Nunavut Tunngavik , and the government of the Northwest Territories to make sure that Nunavut residents see a smooth transition on April 1 , 1999 which is less than 580 days away .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
all those years of relentless efforts have earned me the nickname of Mr. Tenacity .
when I read such a motion I have to ask the following questions :
the old age security and guaranteed income supplement system and private retirement savings plans such as RRSPs are the other two pillars .
i expect it and Canadians expect it .
health
that is the mandate , that is the democracy and the accountability in this place .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to the Speech from the Throne which opened Canada ' s 36 th Parliament .
people ' S TAX FORM ACT
we are told that there are boxes of these passports being used by other countries .
we have to remind everyone that there remains an overarching criminal responsibility with the RCMP that is collaborative with whomever , local police authorities in our ports .
it is on page 4 and is the only reference in the whole document .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
it is basically a good system .
with that I am going to recognize the hon. Leader of the Opposition .
it is bad politics anywhere .
i invite them to participate and perhaps we will find some ways to make Canada better so that they can step aside from the one policy that we find so difficult .
Mr. Speaker , I am honoured to rise to address the Speech from the Throne , this being my first speech in the House .
that is why we have set out in the last budget , during the election and in last week ' s Speech from the Throne concrete priorities where a share of the fiscal dividend should go .
we have never had any such directive in Quebec .
right now it is a summary offence .
i trust that we will continue to give agriculture and members from predominantly rural communities the attention that their traditions , industries and concerns deserve in this country .
finally I would like to take this opportunity to answer some of the critics of these changes .
it would cost $ 1.2 billion for those three items and create 20,400 jobs in this country .
that is why we have the collective duty to work together to make this country even greater and to give the best country in the world to our children and our grandchildren .
Canadians deserve nothing less .
congratulations and welcome to this place .
fifth , what is the optimal level of debt ?
reform has offered such an alternative and I wish members opposite would take this idea seriously .
in our first mandate we toughened sentences for those convicted of hate crimes .
what is the matter over there ?
my riding of Anjou - Rivi 猫 re - des - Prairies is located in the northeastern part of Montreal island .
this government promised written agreements to maintain the income supplement known as TAGS until May 1999 , but without consultation it ripped up this agreement which will now expire one year earlier in May 1998 .
i was listening to the member from across the way .
i hardly call that adequate and reasonable notice in this day and age of democracy .
i did not have the time to finish my speech .
i have not spoken to the bill and I want to speak to the bill .
right now , we just have to let the investigation take its course .
there are 52,000 of those people who hold those rights , who have already registered their children .
before I get right into the nitty - gritty of my first speech -
when I look at this remarkable achievement , I realize why Canadians are more optimistic .
we simply cannot have the biggest government in the country , this government , and the government of the biggest province in the country , Ontario , pursuing fiscal policies that are either going in opposite directions or at 90 掳 to one another .
he did not take the time to listen to or read it .
the government is committed to giving these youth a second chance .
the list of eligible members has also been placed on each member ' s desk .
on the strength of this we can assume that the minister has no sense of what is involved in regional development , since this is what it is all about .
employment INSURANCE
* * *
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) :
* * *
i saw that my parents were allowed to pursue business opportunities and were allowed to keep the fruits of their labour .
fundraisers perhaps , as we saw in Quebec in March and in previous months .
( the House adjourned at 7.18 p.m. )
a public debate is now very important because , for the past four years , they have been feeding us a line .
it did two things .
let me tell the House a story about when I was in diapers .
in any case , he talked about our riding ' s many exporting activities .
points OF ORDER
the government continues to demonstrate that it has the will and the capacity to provide a Canada pension plan that is fair , accountable and affordable .
the decisions we make and the actions we take in the next four years will shape our society for decades to come .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Calgary Southwest , Ref. ) :
i will address both of these scenarios , but I will first address the more desirable scenario , one that will enable a strong and united Canada to live up to its potential in the 21 st century .
my job and that of my colleagues during this debate is to expose the magnitude of the plunder and to unmask the Liberal cynicism which underlies this bill .
i would like to say to all the younger MPs and to the new MPs that we wish to encourage them .
pat Carney , an unelected and it would seem unaccountable appointee , made a statement about how tired she was of the bias shown by the federal government toward B.C.
he wants to renounce a deal made with the provinces including the province of Alberta , fine .
Mr. Speaker , the minister is well aware that opposition members are consulted only after his department has made its recommendation , not before .
this is a simple question to which I would appreciate a simple and clear answer from the Conservative member .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) :
these petitioners ask that the right thing be done in this case .
we will be doing what we can , either through the Board of Internal Economy or in some other way , to make sure the matter is addressed .
it is the voters who decide who will be in Parliament , not us .
one is for 25 bi - level cars for southern California while the other is for 208 subway cars for the Toronto Transit Commission .
hon. Jean J . Charest :
accordingly , we want to keep our efforts focussed on helping small and medium size business develop and market new technologies .
the 9.9 percent contribution rate now to be introduced over the next few years ensures that the CPP will remain affordable for Canadians into the future .
my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois has already brought to light the weaknesses in this speech and they will continue to do so all week long .
what about talking to young Canadians who are concerned about their future ?
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
the truce announced by the Islamic Salvation Front for October 1 ought not to lull us into complacency .
hon. Jean J . Charest
it gave rights to certain classes of people by religious affiliation .
now the sides have flipped a bit and the Liberals are suggesting it is not necessarily a payroll tax .
there are 7 million people in Quebec , 85 percent of whom are francophones .
our federal government , with the Liberal Party at its head , ought to think first of all of saving money , instead of making more cuts and more expenditures , if it wants to have money to spare .
member FOR BOURASSA
i am pleased to speak to the issue .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
in addition , it pours regulatory cold water on the information highway ' s entrepreneurial flame .
the one item that intrigues me about the Speech from the Throne was the fact that 130 years ago the leaders of this country saw the necessity of a national transportation link .
Canadians in the back were asking " Are we at a united Canada yet ? "
some hon. members :
[ translation ] - and to my colleagues of every political persuasion .
in this bill we have set forward a balance yet we have put the primary producer first without question having 10 people elected from areas across this country .
introduction and first reading
Ms. Angela Vautour ( Beaus 茅 jour - Petitcodiac , NDP ) :
we are very conscious of the environmental concerns and environmental impacts in this area .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
the other point is that it is a matter of the kind of house one builds in this country .
where is the value and where does government get off presuming that it is the wisest expenditure of our money ?
we always hear whining from across the way .
the rich in Canada do not pay enough income tax .
the truth comes from the library , but I have no right to show it .
earlier in her comments , the member indicated that she would not mention the Prime Minister ' s name and she did .
many of us here have never been in that situation .
would the hon. member be prepared to admit that , since Quebec is the only francophone province in this part of North America , for his government to consider all provinces equal would be absolutely suicidal , deadly and incompatible with the survival of Quebec ?
i am asking the minister whether he informed the solicitor general at that time .
the operative word is future .
the Speaker :
does he call that accountability ?
the Elizabeth Fry Society of Peterborough and its supporters want this transfer stopped .
among other things , they discussed at length the issue of information on retirement and the ACEF responded to their need .
* * *
i , like other members , congratulate you on your appointment to the Chair .
when he talks about the younger generation not being willing to pay for some of the deficits that are owed in terms of the plan to the old , I would caution him that generations should not be autonomous .
it cannot be proposing these changes without having studied the effects they would have on the middle class .
minister OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS
this same government has put forward new strategies for getting rid of duplication among levels of government , while showing greater respect for the jurisdictions set forth in the Constitution .
bill C - 2 .
in addition to the rapid rise in premiums and how regressive the burden of these are going to be , we are also concerned about the reduction in benefits .
the undersigned call upon Parliament not to proceed with an increase in the federal tax on gas .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his questions .
first , the government is committed to the recognition of Quebec ' s unique language , culture and legal system .
Mr. Jason Kenney
hon. Anne McLellan
Mr. Speaker , I would like to bring to the attention of the House the member ' s comments and his criticisms against the member for Calgary Southeast .
i also want to point out that the Auditor General found a certain lack of rigour in the administration of the disability plan .
Mr. Speaker , this week we begin the last Parliament of this century and the first of the new millennium .
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the opportunity to reassure the employees of Correctional Services Canada that we are very mindful of the danger their job carries with it .
i would also like to congratulate 19 of my constituents from Nunavut , 14 athletes and 5 coaches , who participated in the 1997 Canada Summer Games in Brandon , setting our highest participation rate ever .
this is not a new agenda .
Mr. Mac Harb
the current system costs billions of dollars per year .
until very recently , they were still loath to set specific figures and objectives for their financial management plan .
i am honoured to represent the views of Cariboo - Chilcotin and it is my intention to represent my constituents to the best of my ability .
the President of the Treasury Board has admitted spoke to Jacques Roy this morning .
i say to all my colleagues from every party that should we not be able to pass and proclaim this motion and the resulting bill due to a twist of fate - passing them is not enough , they have to be proclaimed - the national assembly would have a major problem .
they are also creating jobs at a rate four times the national average .
Mr. Andr 茅 Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) :
Mr. Jason Kenney :
i think that we proved it in the 1995 referendum and after .
seniors are asking me what became of the money that they contributed to the Canada pension plan .
CALGARY DECLARATION
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) :
does she admit that the government ' s legislative program denies the existence of the people of Quebec and of their culture ?
this occasion was particularly significant to me as a newly appointed minister .
the Bloc Quebecois found the way to do it because it wanted to .
i was privileged to represent the minister at the launch of HRDC ' s new program , career in a box , creating a partnership between the federal government , the packaging industry and the CEC union .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel :
i thank them for the continued confidence which they first entrusted in me in 1988 , renewed in 1993 and again last June 2 .
if according to Bloc Quebecois policy only individuals are allowed to contribute to the financing of political parties , how can the Bloc Quebecois justify that , in 1994 , candidates for the Bloc Quebecois accepted corporate donations amounting to several thousand dollars in spite of the fact that their internal regulations preclude it ?
the article continues by saying that Guelph - Wellington :
Mr. Speaker , I became aware that other people were involved in this today in the House .
Mr. Richard Marceau
the Leader of the Opposition spoke at length about the most recent case involving Newfoundland .
Ms. Judi Longfield
he very cautiously went about the recommendations and changes that were brought about .
hon. Jean J . Charest :
sitting RESUMED
aside from his actions in tearing up his speech , he failed to draw to our attention that the Brian Mulroney and Conservative era left us with a humongous deficit of $ 42 billion that we inherited in 1993 .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
i give them an iron clad guarantee .
the establishment of the Millennium Scholarship Endowment Fund will help thousands of young Canadians access the education necessary to succeed in the knowledge - based society of the 21 st century .
these principles will be turned into concrete reality by the legislation before us today .
i have to research this a little more because as I said I am very new at this and it is such a large territory with so many topics .
on leadership , I remind my colleagues in the House that there is a vision of a new Canada .
Canadians would continue to be eligible for early retirement starting at age 60 , normal retirement age would be age 65 and late retirement eligibility would continue up to age 70 .
if we accept the member ' s logic , this means that Quebeckers who are against Quebec separating are second class citizens .
all this activity , of which I am very proud , will pave the way for the new economy in our region and in the national capital of a sovereign Quebec .
i am here to talk plainly to you , Mr. Speaker , and through you to the members present .
we understand that deficit reduction is not an end in itself .
i am proud to be part of that effort .
the numbers speak for themselves .
it will not end the pain and suffering women feel on a day to day basis because they have to live with the threat of violence .
moreover , generally speaking , I do not believe I am mistaken in thinking that the anglophone community , via a number of spokespersons , has been rather favourable to the point that , when it comes down to it , what it will get from the linguistic school boards is an enhanced control over its institutions .
this federalist propaganda whose aim is visibility over efficiency has caused the leader of the Bloc Quebecois to say justifiably in his response to the throne speech that the speech was nothing more than big federalist talk .
Windsor - St.
Mr. Ren 茅 Canuel :
Mr. Hec Clouthier
Mr. John Solomon
it is a means to an end .
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) :
i realize that much needs to be done .
the CPP is a public plan funded by employer and employee contributions .
( bill referred to a committee )
but economist Alain Dubuc said it best in one of his editorials , which is worth a second read : " When the Chr 茅 tien government boasts about economic results that are beginning to look up , it does so as a government that owes much to the Conservatives , as a government that is acting on strategic decisions taken by its -
Mr. Speaker , the industry minister chose earlier not to answer a question a Bloc Quebecois member was asking him .
with this legislation Canada will become one of only a handful of countries to have a DNA data bank .
we are starting to see how corrupt the government and its transitional jobs fund are .
how about paring back some of the giveaway programs of the hon. Minister of Canadian Heritage , like her $ 23 million flag giveaway ?
to be in Quebec City for the vote was important to me , to my past .
both partners in that economic unit deserve to share fairly in the money that is earned during the course of the marriage , whether one partner is working in the paid labour force or working for free at home , or both are working in the paid labour force .
first SESSION - 36 TH PARLIAMENT
Ajax is a vibrant community located east of Pickering on the north shore of Lake Ontario .
it goes on and on .
the member asked for specifics .
Mr. Speaker , as a new member to this House , my colleague from Markham , my next door neighbour , offers me an example to clearly and loudly say in this House how different our views of the world are .
this reform has three main components .
i look forward to serving over the next few years under Madam Speaker ' s watchful gaze .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
Mr. Peter Adams
one petition has 73 names of residents from the Courtenay area .
the perception of the riding is really different than the reality , as is probably true of many ridings .
we would like to see an increase in the CPP , but in fact with this legislation we will see a marginal decrease .
the minister has known since February 1996 that international flights would be transferred from Mirabel to Dorval .
up until now CPP contributions not needed to pay for benefits have been loaned mainly to the provinces at the federal government ' s interest rate on long term bonds .
flexibility of the workforce is very important .
we now are at the base floor of $ 12.5 billion .
why would he not visit the Syncrude and Suncor sites in my riding where the mined out areas are now rolling hills retrieved with pine , spruce and poplar .
victims are still not paramount in law and the Young Offenders Act remains in disrepute with the public and the provinces only have the broken promises of YOA funding .
if the government were so concerned about the first nations , why is the Big Cove Reserve suicide situation not recognized as a crisis ?
we cannot help but notice in this year ' s throne speech that element is completely missing .
who provided the information to Mr. Corbeil in the particular case of the Raglan mining company ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
i have to evaluate the information that I have and make a decision as to what is best for Canada Post and for CUPW .
the 1997 budget announced the first down payment of the Government of Canada toward a better way of providing income tax benefits and services to children in poor families .
the people of Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford also believe that the reinforcement of our social programs is a major goal for the government and it is one that I heartily endorse .
it is far different to be sitting in the opposition knowing that you do not have to take seriously the reality of government than it is to be in a position where you are governing and you have to make decisions that will count , decisions that will stick and decisions that will sustain themselves over the years to come .
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) :
however , I want to ask the Prime Minister , who did not answer these questions , what he did in the government as a whole , since there is more than one department that awards contracts , when the Prime Minister , as was his duty , intervened in cabinet to ensure that such activities did not take place during and before the election campaign ?
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
this is before this quasi - judicial board .
Yes.
he will know that many Canadian companies find themselves thwarted in their attempts to obtain licensing in other countries by a process which is neither transparent nor subject to any appeal or judicial review .
madam Speaker , I enjoyed the hon. member ' s speech but his reply did not please me nearly as much .
as we move into the new century the new economy will affect the life and work of every person , every business , every community and every organization in Canada .
Mr. Preston Manning
Mr. Speaker , the prime minister missed the point .
i would like to read a few of the ways the Liberals have spent some of the money so that people can get this into perspective .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
yes , the member is right about internal trade barriers .
our colleague from Kamloops rightly mentioned that taking $ 80 million out of Kamloops will certainly affect the local economy .
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) :
the department has been working with its many partners to help existing exporters identify and access new trading opportunities and provide at the same time perspective exporters with the information , the skills and the tools they need to be export ready .
WHITBY WARRIORS
i will tell members what I told my constituents and those people who voted in the 1997 campaign in my riding .
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) :
Mr. Bob Mills
( the House divided on the amendment to the amendment , which was negatived on the following division : )
as I pointed out , the minister did not move along in this in some way in that he did not hide the fact that this plan needed revision .
the Liberals are even debating whether they should change their name in an effort to reflect this new political love affair .
the Speaker :
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) :
we have a high cost of post - secondary education in a country where wealth abounds .
Mr. Speaker , the privacy commissioner has not been involved in this matter except that a complaint has been made and an investigation will be carried out .
job CREATION
in other words , this is a bilateral amendment which can be made with the approval of the House of Commons and the legislature of the province to which the amendment applies , namely , Quebec .
it is a riding of about 100,000 people , 40 per cent of whom describe their mother tongue as something other than an official language .
it says that it is a grassroots party .
i truly believe that there is unanimity in this House .
policing OF AIRPORTS
i got this from the library this morning .
yet the government has been slow to streamline mining regulations , placing projects like Voisey ' s Bay nickel in serious jeopardy .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
federation OF CANADIAN MUNICIPALITIES
i see I have a short time left to finish and there are a couple of points I would like to underline .
i have had the opportunity to discuss the issue over and over again with my constituents .
Mr. John Cannis ( Scarborough Centre , Lib . ) :
canada represents a triumph of the human spirit , bringing together the best of what people can do .
in his visits to the hill , he always brought along his enthusiasm and his sense of humour .
it ' s too bad he is now in Quebec because I could have asked him to tell me the meaning of " other organizations '' .
i would like to express my sincere appreciation to the people of Etobicoke - Lakeshore .
Mr. Jim Jones :
if this government believes in the real rebalancing of the federation it would also speak to the areas where the national government should reinforce its powers .
for example , the member for Kamloops came up with the idea of cancelling tuition for post - secondary education .
the federal government has the power to demolish these internal trade barriers .
Mr. Preston Manning
they settled near Varennes , in Quebec .
* * *
it is as though the government has stuck its head in the sand .
we will continue to do an excellent job .
it was through the interventions of the hon. member that some of that work was possible .
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) :
another focus of our crime prevention activities involves young people .
the member for Winnipeg Centre and I , and I believe all of my colleagues in our caucus and all parties in this House share in the responsibility of carrying on the legacy of Stanley Knowles .
do you know who lives in CMHC housing ?
one is the fact that transparency will be built into the system .
as has been evident in the House , the Reform Party ' s vision of the justice system is totally different from the vision which we as Liberals have .
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold
* * *
people in Quebec and Abitibi will not be fooled .
madam Speaker , this is very interesting .
it is a simple case of Liberal , Tory , same old incompetent story .
it is a disgrace to the Parliament of Canada that people make these kinds of speeches .
we would offer some intergenerational equity with regard to how we deal with pensions .
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) :
from our rocky shores have come great Canadian writers and leaders in the fields of commerce , labour and statesmanship .
when we find ourselves abroad we have no hesitation in talking about our wonderful country .
reform is the principal spokesperson for the new west in the federal Parliament .
creating partnerships with communities is essential .
one aspect that is extremely cumbersome is that the Canadian Wheat Board has total control over the allocation of wheat cars .
it wants to go back to the past .
for our part the federal government continues to co - operate with the provinces and territories , as well as non - government organizations , to ensure that the health care needs of Canadians , including oral health care needs , are addressed in a cost effective but efficient fashion .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for Calgary Northeast for seconding this bill .
the Speaker
however , changes will limit the extent to which these benefits can be added together .
however , how can he shed light on this question when , as we heard this morning , he cannot even get Israel ' s assurance that it will never again use Canadian passports in this kind of operation ?
resuming debate .
Mr. Bill Blaikie
the government did not want to proceed with thorough public scrutiny of the seniors benefit before the election .
Mr. Speaker , since the information on the companies was not of a confidential nature , as the Minister of Human Resources Development indicated , and since the information was widely disseminated , including to opposition parties and to the provincial government , the answer to the hon. member is no .
unfortunately I will not have time to get through the nine very important questions that I think need to be addressed .
j . S . Woodsworth and Stanley Knowles won the admiration of all Canadians for their honesty , their dignity and for their courage .
hon. Don Boudria
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Mike Scott
he was part of a firm that gave thousands of dollars to the Liberal Party of Canada in its funding drive .
a reduction of debt is not the ultimate essence of our obligation .
will they be 13 % or will they be higher ?
we have crime .
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Bill Blaikie
i do not only wish to pay tribute to them , I also want to thank them for showing me that we have everything to gain by getting to know one another and by working together , with respect to our differences certainly , but also with the profound conviction that our membership in the Canadian family is a guarantee of security , fairness and prosperity for everyone in this country .
they have never opened the book , or they read it and they chose to ignore it , to say things they know are not stated in the book and to ignore the things that really are there .
Meech lake is gone and so is Premier Wells .
that is what is happening with our debt .
CPP hikes proposed by this government with current EI premiums will further burden already over taxed Canadians .
Mr. G 茅 rard Asselin ( Charlevoix , BQ ) :
they are staying in school .
hon. Jane Stewart :
there are a variety of reasons why this is a very important matter .
they will of course get information to prepare them to save , even a little .
today I want to offer the Prime Minister a great opportunity , an opportunity to do something for unemployed Canadians and young unemployed Canadians .
did he see the one on investing in quality care and good health ?
let us seize that opportunity .
Mr. Speaker , congratulations on your appointment as deputy chairman of the committees of the whole House .
DORA AWARDS
it continues to repeat the mistakes of the past .
the Canada pension plan system is not just a pension .
could you clarify that for me ?
the House has heard the terms of this motion .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
the implementation of our long awaited territory is rapidly approaching and co - operation between parties involved is necessary .
open your ears and listen to him .
we all heard during the last election about the problem with youth unemployment .
with those words I must say that it is with some regret that I rise to speak on the issue which is before the House .
however , I believe it is the role of the official opposition to also offer some constructive criticism .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Health .
so , it is easy to boast and to brag , but taxpayers will not forget that the Minister of Finance made himself look good at the expense of Quebecers and Canadians .
appointment of Deputy Chairman
it deals with majority and minority rights .
i appreciate everything that you have done and will continue to do for me .
this resulted in improvements to roads , sewers and other infrastructure of the riding .

government ORDERS
the House met at 10 a.m.
it wants to raise those taxes even higher and go against all of the conventional economic wisdom which says that will reduce job growth and mean fewer opportunities for Canadians to get a leg up in the tough new 21 st century economy .
Mr. Gordon Earle
the partisan feelings that would suggest that we could make it better on our own or that somehow life would be better if we split up certainly do exist .
i agree with the minister .
it is very similar to diverting a share of our national income to fund medical care in Canada , to make sure that regardless of one ' s financial means , we have universal accessibility to decent health care .
an internal memo of the Department of Industry established that only 13 percent of the trade barriers had been struck down in the last agreement .
first would be a fairer tax system in the country which is not necessarily the tax breaks advocated by the party the member represents .
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton
it is both product and consumer oriented in nature , resulting in long term relationships and a better consumer understanding of Canadian grain .
can the minister explain why he is publicly talking about a 5 per cent unemployment rate when privately his department says the opposite ?
i congratulate you for your efforts .
the HRD committee set an all time record for the amount of hours spent here in Ottawa and on the road .
that ' s a cheap remark .
from a competing farmer ' s perspective , we in the U.S. do not have a vehicle like the CWB to create producer marketing power in the international grain trade .
the auditor general also found that the regional development programs had an inefficient system for determining qualified recipients .
yesterday the minister promised more information in the House today .
it says it will continue to deal with foreign overfishing when those very people are again abusing the situation and the government obviously is rewarding them for taking our fish inside of 200 .
their families are here in the gallery filled with pride as they have listened to their family members speak in a place where so few of us ever have the opportunity to come and in an environment of freedom and free speech speak our minds and say what we believe .
i wish to move a subamendment .
madam Speaker , I really appreciated and enjoyed the speech just given by the member .
Mr. Speaker , I draw to the attention of the House and the government the grave situation facing students in this country who are reeling under student loan debt and the crisis which is in our post - secondary institutions .
based on what I have seen and heard from Reformers , they will continue to attack the wheat board .
Mr. Speaker , I am honoured to speak in the House for the first time .
i am sorry the member for Elk Island does not recognize there are social and economic priorities and not just tax reductions .
despite that , the plan is still affordable .
CPP stands for the Canadian government standing behind the Canadian people , which the Reform Party refuses to do .

so what if government keeps borrowing ?
Mr. Rahim Jaffer
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) :
i wanted to clarify it for all the members .
it not only provides equality of access to Canadians across the country to health care , it also embodies and reflects shared Canadian values of compassion , of sharing and of equality .
they asked for cash because they did not want any connection to be made between the favours granted and the contributions collected by the Liberal Party .
in my opinion the nays have it .
it was very interesting when they were campaigning .
the Calgary declaration acknowledges the equality of all citizens and all provinces .

Mr. Ghislain Fournier ( Manicouagan , BQ ) :

let us go back to the 1996 by - election in Lac - Saint - Jean .

i want to ask the Minister of Health , if he cannot even protect the confidentiality of an individual ' s files , how can we be assured he is protecting the health and safety of Canadians ?
in the light of this politicization of culture , a group of men and women has started a campaign to find popular funding to produce this film , which will revive an important moment of Quebecers ' history .

indeed there are problems related to illiteracy .
i think this is in part an answer to my hon. friend ' s question .
today , we have the opportunity for success in the 21 st century that is far beyond what Laurier could have ever imagined .
i will not go over the facts , as they were related several times earlier .
Mr. Speaker , I am always amazed by the excessive reactions we get from that side of the House .
some hon. members :
will the environment minister commit to this today ?
to summarize this , it is diverting a share of our output toward the common good , to try to equalize the opportunities of condition in Canada , to try to have a more equal society where people do not have to worry about such fundamental needs as food , clothing , shelter and medical care .
i would like to extend a special thank you to my constituents for placing that trust in me and to my family .

it takes some gall on the part of a minister who is from Quebec to talk about the youth strategy and job creation .
i hope the Reform Party will continue to assist in finding a solution to this serious problem .
it refers to the devolution of powers of ports police to municipal police officers and potentially RCMP officers .
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :
this in itself should demonstrate to the government that reducing payroll taxes would help stimulate growth in the Canadian economy .
with a belief in hard work and with a commitment to meritocracy , they began to rebuild their lives .
the transition to the new economy is not automatic .
Mr. Janko Peric :

i represent a large university in my riding .
Mr. Speaker , if it is not too late I wish to inform the House that I will be sharing my time with the member for Calgary West .
in 1997 the combined contribution rate for employees will increase from 5.85 percent of covered earnings to 6 percent .
this means putting more money into the plan without asking Canadians to pick up the tab and without creating more threats to job creation .
we would not be involved in the national unity debate today had we had a little common sense back in 1990 .
the Bombardier plant in my riding of Thunder Bay - Atikokan was recently awarded an $ 81 million contract for 50 commuter cars for New York .

it could get rid of the Canadian Wheat Board altogether which 37 % of farmers recently voted in favour of , quite an astounding vote to toss the wheat board out completely .
i also speak for a party whose leader consults with real people , not imaginary ones , about their interests and needs and has a long term vision for the country based on openness and compassion .
Mr. Speaker , it could take me quite some time to respond to this , but I shall try to be brief .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to commend the Reform Party , both this hon. member ' s speech and the leader ' s speech yesterday .
in many cases borders between our provinces have been more daunting than the Himalaya mountains .

this is simply reasonable , this is plain common sense .

after all that , Canadian voters decided last June that this record of achievement and commitment deserved a new mandate , the mandate they gave to this government .
likewise this parliament can also do great things as we distance ourselves from the financial doom and gloom of the past number of years .
when is the federal government going to assert its powers and leadership and deal with internal trade ?
Mr. Speaker , it goes without saying that the case of seasonal workers is a concern to us and we are closely monitoring the employment insurance reform we undertook .
Mr. Norman Doyle
for those who always claim that citizens rights to initiative and referendum are not compatible with our style of parliamentary democracy , I say bunkum .

there is the tax credit for political contributions .
they have become part of our history because of the extent of the disaster but mostly because in a time of crisis a remarkable spirit of co - operation emerged that left no one indifferent and brought all Canadians together in Quebec and in Manitoba .
will the prime minister suspend this grant until the police can confirm that this was not extortion of Videon Inc. ?
second of all why does he not deal with the real numbers ?
i did want to mention the third referendum , which is not far off .
could the member tell me what kind of disability insurance programs are incorporated into their super RRSP ?
still on the subject of influence peddling , we have the impression that all the federal Liberal ministers from Quebec were aware of what was happening .

Mr. Speaker , in 1989 , the Department of National Defence was ordered by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to enrol more women in the next ten years .

as the Speech from the Throne has noted , we are now well ahead of our own optimistic 1993 projections to balance the budget by the year 2000 .
why was that ?
is the member prepared to renounce the type of co - operative arrangement we have worked out with the provinces in terms of the Canada child tax benefit where the federal government and the provinces will concentrate on children who are members of working families in the poorest income bracket ?

it is known that the CPP falls short in certain areas that have been criticized by the Auditor General and that we hope will soon be corrected , because it is a very large drain on the system not to be able to operate at peak efficiency .

Mr. Speaker , what the reform has done was to respond to a need , specifically the need to ensure that there would be pensions in the next century , without having to pay an exorbitant price for them .
in conclusion , I say that the vision for the national voyage must be based on honesty , competence and leadership .
it is paying you off .
then there is old age security , the guaranteed income supplement and the spouse ' s allowance .

i had been listening to people like Peter Lougheed , Grant Devine , Joe Ghiz , David Peterson and Bill Bennett , people whom we all respect and admire .
i encourage members of the House to communicate the message that the Canada pension plan is here and will be here when Canadians need it .
we look to those whom we have elected to represent and govern us to provide a measure of leadership to help us to meet the challenges of the day .
Mr. Speaker , there have also been consultations regarding the following :
Mr. Art Hanger
it is incumbent on the Reform Party to make it clear that its system does not come without tremendous cost .
but that is just for the time being .
they are going to be held accountable in this Parliament for having done that .
i realize that Madam Speaker is about to cut me off so I will just say I appreciate the opportunity to say these few words .
if we are going to put them in the driver ' s seat why do we not let them drive and have all of the board members from the industry rather than just ten ?

however , we can see that if there is a need to provide benefits and we have not planned that rates can go very high .
i have to say that the businesses are very aware of the need for fixing the Canada pension plan and the problems that have plagued the Canada pension plan for many years .
let me ask the minister for HRD this .
let me tell you I did not appreciate the Liberal Party ' s little destabilization tactics in the middle of the campaign .
we want to be able to believe and trust what we hear .
the Speaker :
last weekend the federalists in the Liberal Party of Quebec - they are federalists in Quebec ' s Liberal Party , not sovereigntists - found the Calgary declaration wanting , given Quebec ' s traditional expectations .
in Canada the crime rate is too high .
need I say more ?
in my lifetime I do not remember another finance minister who not only set and met the targets but exceeded them .
Mr. Mark Muise
bill C - 8 .
the constitutional impasse is still there , even more so since the Calgary declaration .
it is the envy of several countries in the world , as I just said .
it is causing incredible stress for their families .
as stated in the Speech from the Throne " one in three Canadian jobs depend on trade '' .
* * *
the question , as worded , is out of order .
health CARE
i want to say to my constituents and to all Canadians , Atlantic Canadians , today that we will not let them down in the coming Parliament .
this amount will be indexed .
Mr. Speaker , I am honoured to be making my maiden speech before the House today .
i applaud those individuals , in particular a present Ottawa resident , Minnijean Brown Trickey , who was one of the Little Rock Nine .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the time you have taken to study this matter and to bring down the ruling to the House .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
we argue that is a much more effective way of ultimately not only delivering money into the hands of people in Atlantic Canada and allowing them to have more money for consumption but also ultimately what it does is allow small businesses to start to spring up .
the RCMP is conducting an arm ' s length investigation , as it should .
even if the necessary parameters are built in to ensure the viability of the CPP , with the best intentions in the world , this plan must still be wisely , appropriately and properly administered .
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) :
my question is for the minister responsible for Canada Post .
i might want to remind my hon. friend , who probably does not need reminding , being the economist that he is , that there are many countries in the world where child poverty does not exist .
creating opportunities for young Canadians is , to my mind , a huge priority .
again , will the justice minister immediately dismiss those involved in what her own official described as a false story and a cover - up ?
we are committed to building a prosperous country , through careful and responsible policies aimed at reducing underemployment and child poverty , and a healthy country that will remain healthy thanks to better organized health care services .
they have to arrive at the best possible bottom line .
the initiative in Fergus underscores the necessity for Canadians wherever they live to support cultural and community endeavours such as this .
those witnesses included representatives of most seniors groups , and even some young people came to make their views known .
Mr. Speaker , again it goes back to question period and the purpose of question period .
he does not want to come home until he has completed his task , but now he says that he may be forced to .
although Canada ' s system is one of the best in the world , major demographic and economic shifts are threatening its long term sustainability .
i want to thank all my constituents for having the courage to place their trust in a man of only 25 years of age who belongs to a party only 10 years old .
i take this opportunity to outline some of our recent initiatives in the industry portfolio and how we will continue to improve the various department endeavours .
it has not been since 1949 when Newfoundland joined Confederation that something of this magnitude has occurred in Canada .
it is extremely important to ensure that steps are taken to enhance the morale and the esprit de corps of our public servants .
not only was he present but other members from the government side were present and their counterparts of the provincial governments came to hear the witnesses with them .
these are young Canadians who have low levels of education and skills .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
there is still an opportunity .
at this point , it seems obvious that each government will opt for different methods .
Mr. Randy White
Ms. Sarmite Bulte
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
i would ask hon. members to bear that in mind in the course of their remarks .
in spite of that efficiency we have a government in the province of Ontario right now that in the name of a dollar would save putting up the Ontario flag on a day .
in Sault Ste. Marie they ride the Algoma Central Railway to the Agawa Canyon , tour the Sault locks and visit the magnificent displays at the Canadian Bushplane Heritage Centre .
i believe the issue of unity can only be addressed by people of goodwill .
this cultural diversity is shared by many cities and towns in Canada .
parish OF SAINT - R 脡 MI DE LAC - AUX - SABLES
Mr. Speaker , the member and the House knows my commitment .
Mr. Reg Alcock ( Winnipeg South , Lib . ) :
this means that the right to secede exists only in a colonial context .
a guarantee of receiving the revenues generated by their work would be the best way to stimulate creators and craftspeople in this area of cultural activity .
if directors act honestly and in good faith , as it states they must in this legislation , then why do they require protection from criminal activities ?
the auditor general also stated " their objectives are not clearly established and performance measuring is inadequate so it is impossible to tell if the programs are meeting their objectives '' .
* * *
politics and the opportunity to be part of a good government that can make a real difference in people ' s lives is indeed the highest calling .
Mr. Chuck Strahl
canada PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT
more than 700,000 people of Chinese ancestry live in Canada today , but that was not always so .
too often these are the same people who would like to sever all connections before the government and the board .
if this evidence does not exist then the Chair cannot rule on it one way or another .
in no way does the government accept responsibility for political interference with the Somalia inquiry .
we have important priorities to make sure the young generation makes a successful transition to the world of work .
i wonder if we could extend the hour accordingly so that he might have a chance to make his speech as well .
it is an honour for me to be their MP .
i do not have to be told by former employees or by anybody else what the role of the health protection branch is .
QUEBEC PREMIER
we should not fear the future but we should look forward to it .
* * *
this is my first speech since the new Parliament began .
i sat in this House for four years listening to the rhetoric of the other side of the House , the government side , and really when it comes down to it I never noticed too many sacrifices being made at all .
i find that to be totally intolerable .
Mr. Speaker , the U.S. post office handles 40 percent of the world ' s mail and its Postmaster General , Marvin Runyon , makes $ 205,000 Canadian per year .
Ms. Angela Vautour :
yeas
on August 29 , 1997 my staff offered to have senior departmental officials from the Alberta region provide the member for Wild Rose with a briefing on the initiatives being undertaken by the department in the Stony community .
Mr. John Reynolds
does he represent himself or does he represent his party ?
we will never in a 100 years solve the problems of the 1990 s with the solutions of the 1970 s .
in the same decision Speaker Fraser further stated : " The Speaker ' s duty is confined to interpreting the procedures and practices of the House of Commons '' .
they are going to issue annual statements .
at that point perhaps you , Mr. Speaker , would want to rule then whether or not there has been an instance of contempt , as opposed to simply a misunderstanding by someone who may or who may not have committed a mistake .
we want Canadians to have a chance .
if they say a bad decision was made at the time , we cannot overturn it now because the policy is to turn airports over to local -
Mr. Amerasinghe states in his memo that if Ted Thompson testified in court " The damage done to the image of the department , the attorney general and the court will be incalculable for all time and the consequences could be far reaching , going far beyond the immediate concern for these three cases .
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) :
in 1996 the centre responded to well over 10,000 requests .
first of all , the Environmental Assessment Act , which came into effect during the previous mandate , impinges directly on provincial responsibilities and in many ways duplicates Quebec ' s legislation in this area .
presently the Tory leader is raising money in Saskatchewan and perhaps stopping in on the trial of Senator Bernston who is facing charges of criminal fraud .
these are simple things that are taken for granted by anyone who is part of a private pension plan .
they are concerned that this choice is increasingly threatened by legislation and statutory regulations of the government .
we will do the best to ensure that all the recommendations made by the board will be adhered to very quickly .
order IN COUNCIL APPOINTMENTS
is there unanimous consent to extend the time for questions and comments ?
to accomplish this equality we must have true representation by population in the House of Commons .
we have to look at these options .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the solicitor general .
- health , Votes 1 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 and 30
madam Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Winnipeg North - St.
my colleagues and I are well aware that we have an enormous responsibility , a mandate born out of suffering and out of hope .
all those in favour of the subamendment will please say yea .
perhaps my colleague could mention that .
further watering down recognition of the Quebec people , this government has embraced the definition in the Calgary declaration , referring to the " unique character of Quebec society '' , as unique as B.C. salmon , and without constitutional amendments .
its trustees have to be appointed on a non - partisan basis , recruiting from experts in the financial , business and actuarial communities in consultation with the provinces .
there are going to be more seniors .
with respect to small business , there are many members on this side of the House who are certainly very committed to the small business sector and believe that the small business sector is the engine of growth in the Canadian economy .
however , there is a reformist alternative of democratic free market principles that rigorously defends equality of opportunity , denies discrimination in any form to keep a foothold and trusts the common sense of average Canadians to do what is right and just for the country .
* * *
it is very simple .
we must all contribute , each in our areas of competency , to meet the challenge we have set for ourselves .
this is a real battle against child poverty .
Mr. Speaker , my response to my capitalist friend from Crowfoot is I understand the new Reform members of Parliament are part of the pension plan as well .
suspension OF SITTING
* * *
i will take my election mandate to mean that it is a change that the people of Strathcona desire and I will work tirelessly to ensure that change occurs in this House .
what about cutting payroll taxes so that we are not penalizing people for creating jobs and small businesses ?
it would seem to me that judicial screening will ensure the safety of the public in relation to killers like Mr. Bernardo .
Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos :
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
do not just think about it , do it , do it , do it .
although we are of different political stripes and although we hold different viewpoints on various issues , I believe that the one thing we all hold in common is that we deeply believe in the principles for which we are fighting .
one too many governments is involved in this , and Quebeckers feel that theirs is not the one that is superfluous .
all Quebeckers have heard about this agreement is some negative attacks by the Premier of Quebec .
in my riding and in other regions of Canada , there are business representatives that tell me they are unable to recruit people with the necessary skills for new positions .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
that $ 100 billion brings our total indebtedness to just under $ 600 billion which , of course , does not include another $ 600 billion in the Canada pension plan Ponzi scheme for which my generation is going to have to pay .
otherwise we will end up with an $ 11 billion or $ 12 billion bite out of the economy .
as I stated in my ruling of February 15 , 1995 on a similar matter , confidentiality is a key issue for committees .
Mr. Bob Mills
it is a few trips to the grocery store for people in my riding .
if conservative numbers are used , then it is usually safer ground if things happen to not be as bright as one would hope .
the financial decisions of this government have even been felt directly in my riding .
he used little phrases in his comment that really caught my attention .
we are talking about $ 130 billion .
the House met at 10 a.m.
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
they did not even bother to re - write it .
as well Bill C - 2 amends the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security Act with respect to information sharing , investigations and penalties .
the people of my riding in northern New Brunswick did not hear about the consultations .
it does not believe in the private sector which runs this country .
the Canadian government is not in the habit of paying compensation to those who have lost no money .
the Liberals must promise to provide a system whereby those provinces not interested in participating or already having such a program , like Quebec , can withdraw from the program , with full compensation .
Kesselman goes on to write that " Canada has perhaps the most diverse range of payroll taxes of any country .
Mr. Speaker , does the hon. member of the Bloc understand that when the country was founded the aboriginal people were here and that when the francophone people arrived the aboriginal people said to them " come on to the land and we will continue to build Canada ? "
this is nonsense .
we look forward to helping to renew and develop new partnerships between communities , the police , the voluntary sector and all levels of government .
i applaud this initiative .
among the more important of them is the national search and rescue service .
the results are , and the member can and look just as easily as I can , as the member suggested to me , that the U.S. went to a deficit of $ 1 trillion in that same period of time , almost bankrupting that country .
it appears that VIA did not undertake to make certain changes throughout its system .
we have made solid gains .
i embrace the desire to be innovative as we look at national unity .
Ottawa ' s refusal to bring down EI premiums at the same time as CPP rates go up had been the biggest barrier to an agreement .
pension reform will also be very important .
it provides replacement of a quarter of insurable earnings .
criminal CODE
can the Minister of Finance tell us if his government has provided for precise measures to support these programs , of which only the United Way , with means -
again I wish to say on behalf of the official opposition that we probably have not seen the end of Frank McKenna in this country .
an ever growing number of Canadians have already understood and are contributing to registered retirement savings plans .
generally speaking , any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament in the performance of its functions , or which obstructs or impedes any member or officer of such House in the discharge of his duty , or which has a tendency , directly or indirectly , to produce such results may be treated as a contempt even though there is no precedent of the offence .
government ORDERS
there was no possibility of asking Canadians to immediately put in dollars they needed for food and for basic subsistence .
but change goes hand in hand with new opportunities .
as a society we need to seize the opportunity early in the lives of our children to nurture their development and to help them prepare for the years ahead .
she was going to do something to tighten up the Young Offenders Act .
these initiatives are well known and the results are well documented .
i like to say that Windsor is effectively the centre of the universe , but that may not be the case for some of my colleagues .
the Liberals claim that the screw - up they created could have been worse .
Mr. Speaker , I am honoured to present a petition to the House of Commons signed by constituents of Cariboo - Chilcotin residing in Williams Lake , Ashcroft , 150 - Mile House and Tatlayoko Lake .
i do apologize , Mr. Speaker .
the old expression is that Atlantic Canada is a nice place to live , provided you can get a job .
the amendment put forward by the hon. member for Calgary Southwest draws attention to three important principles on which constitutional amendments should always be based : democratic consent , the rule of law and the national interest .
the October issue of Reader ' s Digest said it received an enormous response to a July article and that the vast majority of letter writers agreed wholeheartedly that it was unfair for the government to tax a single income family more than a double income family making the same amount .
the question we are debating today is one of fundamental importance .
that a Message be sent to the Senate to acquaint that House accordingly .
he gave particular attention in his speech to agriculture and to unemployment .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
what is he talking about ?
in that sense , it seems unacceptable to me that the position that will be put forward as Canada ' s position be taken by a mere handful of Liberals and senior civil servants .
what did the minister himself do in all this ?
they could never know that future but they could ensure that it would happen by putting in place those building blocks upon which its future could be founded .
why has a referendum on this issue not been held in Quebec in the past 15 years ?
Mr. John Reynolds
first , other government run disasters do not work .
recently scientists and engineers from around the world were brought together with teachers and students through an on line discussion news group .
and yet we knew we had a future .
it is disgusting and hypocritical .
yet it concerns me .
Ms. Sarmite Bulte
moreover , we are fully aware of the uncertainty felt by some groups and citizens in Quebec ' s anglophone minorities .
subsequently he served in that same position with the Hon. Ross MacDonald and the Hon. Jack Pickersgill .
i can hear my hon. friend now , that whining we hear all the time : " Where are they going to get the money ? "
there were some assumptions built into the benefit levels and the premium levels .
we will do everything it takes to make Canada a strong and united country .
that is despite what the finance minister himself said on a number of occasions .
for instance , the new commitment of another $ 850 million to the child tax credit is something that will address the concerns that were addressed by the member in the prelude to his question .
given the language of former Bill C - 72 we feared that the government and not farmers would control the board ' s destiny .
Mr. Joe Jordan
it is not just an isolated case like the minister would like to talk about .
in the fifth section of our paper we talk about the optimal level of debt .
i would ask that the Chair enforce the time limits on this debate .
i move :
members
civilians , most of them women and children , continue to meet ghastly deaths .
the purpose of my speech is to talk about the role of a parliamentarian in this parliament which takes us into the millennium .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Louis Plamondon :
a week after a major incident takes place the government is telling Canadians that it does not really know what is happening .
will the prime minister tell Canadians what the Government of Canada knows about this attack and about these two Canadian passport holders ?
we must see what partnerships are possible and then see what we can do to be the catalyst to help get the job done .
not very many .
a foreign leader rolls out the red carpet and the government does nothing .
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with my colleague , the hon. member for Longueuil .
i listened very carefully as he talked about the tough choices the government had to make .
i would ask the House to consider these Canadian characteristics and then reflect on the legislation before us today .
what are the deal breakers ?
those are the defects I would like to get into .
the National Assembly approved the resolution unanimously , which means that all parties agree .
the source of this anxiety , among other things , are the cuts in spending by all levels of government , and the necessary restructuring that the delivery of health care services has gone through in recent years .
i take these questions to be the principal test that the Government of Canada feels members should apply to this amendment .
he broke prairie sod with oxen south of Rosetown , Saskatchewan . With his three sons he went through the technological transformation of the agricultural industry , from ploughing with oxen , to ploughing with horses , to the old days of steam machines , to the days of gasoline and diesel tractors .
if there is something I intend to do , it is to show passion in this House .
madam Speaker , this is not the time to be talking about Bill C - 2 .
the Quebec government introduced Bill 149 to deal with the Quebec pension plan and to amend various related acts .
Mr. Jim Pankiw
part of the contribution that will continue to be made to mandatory pension savings would go to fund the unfunded liability which this Liberal government has allowed to develop .
government SERVICES
the meaning , I believe , is created by the change that is possible if we have the will to act .
they used to sing The Taxman by the Beatles , now they have changed to another one entitled Hey , Big Spender .
when government takes money from people through taxation , it is essentially saying that it is in a better position to determine what to do with that money than the individuals .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
* * *
the fishing industry is not so well off .
as we heard from the finance committee they do not even have it in their schedule to discuss this .
the ENVIRONMENT
i heard somebody say " bingo '' .
as previous members have done , I would like to extend to you , Madam Speaker , my congratulations on your appointment .
Mr. Preston Manning
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
now we have the NDP .
i think this is important , and I wish to pursue the point , because when I came to Ottawa , to this House , I came with my head held high , because the people of Quebec elected us .
this would call for an effective government structure to be put into place in order to ensure sound fund management with the right measures of independence and accountability .
we will continue to respect this House despite the fact that many members on the government side try to defile it and use it for their own anti - sovereignist obsessions , as they are presently trying to do with the Supreme Court .
they still retained their rights in the educational system of our province , including the right to teach their children in their particular faith beliefs .
division No. 3
we were not mean , as some of our opponents will have you believe , but we were lean .
the government to its credit acknowledges that the social safety net is frayed , that we are in trouble with respect to health care , with respect to pensions , with respect to child poverty and in some respects with regard to education .
it is about the much criticized relocation to the neighbouring town of Saint - Antoine - des - Laurentides of the employment centre that has always been located in Saint - J 茅 r 么 me , the economic capital of the Laurentian area .
let the member consider his conscience and let us work together .
i am proud to carry on his work .
we wish you patience and wisdom in your deliberations in guiding our deliberations and express the hope that the spirit of democracy expressed on the first day you were elected will continue throughout this Parliament .
it is a great honour to be entrusted with the responsibility of representing a constituency that includes the prestigious University of Alberta , an academic institution poised to become one of the finest in the world .
bill C - 2 , which the Minister of Finance introduced on September 25 , provides for a reform of the Canada pension plan , among other things .
the federal job strategy program has also had some positive impact on commercial activity and some of the social institutions in the community .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
this corporation will be responsible for managing $ 1 million in adjustment money that the defence department made available to the area .
that is what is hateful about the situation .
the debate has only just begun and we are confident that a reasonable debate will enlist public support for our point of view and that of taxpayers and young Canadians who have little or no voice in this debate .
on behalf of 1.4 million unemployed Canadians , will the government commit today to set clear timetables and targets for the reduction of unemployment ?
this was unprecedented : a 40 per cent cut in funding .
studies in the United States and Canada comparing ESOP versus non - ESOP companies have consistently shown ESOP companies to be superior performers in profitability and job growth .
jean Pr 茅 vost was the Quebec vice - president of the Liberal Party and Marlene Hore was right near the top in running the advertising for the Liberal election campaign .
he is referring to transferring certain responsibilities for forestry , social housing , mining and several other issues to the provinces .
several incidents of vandalism and theft in one night in the small rural town of Melbourne in my riding have given law - abiding citizens cause for concern .
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) :
i noticed that there is definitely a requirement of external auditors so that the external people will basically review the operations of that and report directly not only to government but to the people generally .
if any member gets involved , it is unfortunate .
in knocking on doors throughout the general election of 1997 I experienced that transformation of optimism .
the interest rate is low .
i want him to know that he is a perfect example of what I would never want to be .
Mr. Speaker , this past weekend Merrickville , a community in my riding , was a participant in the Communities in Bloom national finals .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
it is a monumental opportunity to foster a sense of nationhood , a sense of growth in our country and a sense of where we as Canadians can come together .
congratulations to the athletes , six of whom are from my constituency , and their coaches , for striving to be the first ever hockey team from the NWT to participate in the 1999 Canada Winter Games in Cornerbrook , Newfoundland .
we are committed to that , but it will cost money to honour those obligations .
appointment OF A SPECIAL JOINT COMMITTEE
the increase for a worker at the average range will total no more than $ 24 .
most parts of the Constitution cannot be amended without the consent of at least seven provincial legislatures plus Parliament , as provided by the amending formula in section 38 of the Constitution Act of 1982 .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the parliamentary secretary and I hope my behaviour in this House may be as dignified as his own .
procedure AND HOUSE AFFAIRS
we pay Bay Street , Wall Street , Hong Kong , bond bankers for money borrowed to finance yesterday ' s programs .
there would likely be no critique from this side of the House on that .
however , I do know that the sacrifice is worth making if one wants to live in the greatest nation on earth .
oh , oh .
we do not see any real options in the bill .
perhaps Mr. Speaker would want to accept this suggestion and , if so , render a ruling tomorrow or later .
i would like now to speak of my immediate concerns and the questions this committee must answer .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau
first the people of South Shore deserve better than what this government is putting forward as its plan for the future .
during my brief remarks I was congratulating you , the other speakers and all members of Parliament on their election or re - election to this august Chamber .
i think the minister could find a stronger point to hang his argument on .
i thank the prime minister for giving me that opportunity .
that has to be one of its most fundamental flaws .
i would also like to emphasize the changes proposed by the federal government with respect to the disability pension .
he did nothing yesterday and nothing today .
that is what Liberalism is all about .
he did his duty , he handed the case over to the police , who are investigating the matter , and when the police finish their investigation , they will draw the appropriate conclusions .
Mr. Speaker , let me be very clear .
they are hanging their heads in shame .
Mr. Speaker , I know you will agree with me that is not the case .
madam Speaker , with nine years of seniority and after a four year absence to recycle himself , the hon. member for Abitibi has changed sides .
the Reform Party , and this is why I will not support the motion , is really a throwback to the past .
hon. David M. Collenette
there is some gain and some loss , and we know we are not there yet .
for example , Bill C - 41 permitted conditional sentencing which , while useful in some cases , is applicable to even those who violently offend within our communities .
and in this mandate my government will assure seniors ' security for the future .
the name Charlotte really does not do justice to the description of the riding .
the Speaker :
i acknowledge the comments of the hon. member and share his view .
that tragic event serves as a reminder that fire can strike any time , anywhere and no one is immune to it .
i am sure those students , those young people in Quebec , are happy to share in a federal program that has a federal initiative and vision about where the country is going in the area of science and technology .
there is no change in retirement age .
why was the warrant issued but not executed ?
second we will improve the rate of return on the CPP fund by investing it prudently in a diversified portfolio of securities .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
our youth will look to the future with confidence and enthusiasm as they should .
we will cut your funding for equipment and staff in the Canadian armed forces '' .
this is being celebrated right across the country now and we certainly appreciate it .
quite simply , what sound management of taxpayers ' money stands for is the need for any responsible government to introduce legislation to make fiscal balance mandatory , lower employment insurance premiums and reduce personal income tax .
* * *
agreed .
why is that ?
the lesser lights , though well meaning , who took his place were unable to build on the foundation which he had laid .
it is of the utmost importance for the Government of Canada to focus on issues like tariffs , apprenticeship training for skilled trades and on other areas that will offer support to our domestic automotive industry .
he cited all kinds of academics to prove the point that the increases to CPP premiums are a tax .
hon. Christine Stewart
however most Quebeckers have no way of knowing what is in that declaration , that it is primarily a commitment to consult the public and that what it is seeking to do is to balance acknowledgement of uniqueness with acknowledgement of equality as citizens and provinces .
what did it do about that ?
on the other hand he said that we had to use those mechanisms .
she said that she would deal with Canadians ' concerns that the Young Offenders Act has become a leaking sieve rather than a catch basin which would look after our justice problems .
given everything we have found out these past two weeks about this influence peddling business , I want to ask the Prime Minister the following question :
Mr. Bill Gilmour
i salute my parents and all those immigrants to Canada who came to help build this great country of ours with a commitment to tolerance , understanding and a burning desire to give their children an opportunity for a better life .
the Bloc Quebecois finds itself as the principal Quebec party , the main voice for Quebec in Ottawa .
George ' s , was in the house of assembly with me at that time .
the hon. member should check and see what the procedure is , in the Government of Canada , for awarding contracts .
in this speech I did not hear things that I felt very good about .
but her life ' s work , not even respect for the dead , could spare her from those who want to protect their world from her message .
the large grain companies and the wheat board itself are located in Winnipeg along with the commodities exchange and a host of suppliers that make their living on the effectiveness of the work done in the farming communities around the urban centres .
the NDP ' s plan during the election was just not practical .
we are asking them to be part of this deceptive scheme that will take six years to implement .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday this House paid tribute to one its greats , Stanley Knowles .
it is what Canadians have asked for and it is what Canadians are getting .
i do not understand what part of democracy the Reform Party does not like .
the hon. member for Edmonton East .
interparliamentary DELEGATIONS
the Deputy Speaker :
being the wonderful gentleman that he was , after the election he came to visit me .
one wonders whether he still lives in Quebec , because he misinterprets what is going on there .
by focusing on the determinants of health , whether through diet or proper amount of exercise or lifestyle choices , we are ensuring that Canadians of all ages will preserve their health and will not need the health care system .
but very much a part of that model are the words responsibility and sharing .
i regularly remind them that it is imperative that they follow all instructions issued to them on their conduct in their official capacity .
we will not only respond to the Somalia inquiry but we will comment on the many things that we have done since then to bring about institutional changes and reforms in the Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces .
the Department of Finance has produced several studies and reports .
taxation
it is a chronic problem and a lack of a solution to it does nothing for the image of Canada among the leading industrialized nations of the world , of which Canada is one .
i can tell you that we will do everything in our power to keep it good and honest .
Canadians have talked about it for a long time .
i want to bring to the Chair ' s attention that at no time did the government House leader raise the subject of a time allocation agreement at our meetings .
on another important issue , specifically the efficiency of our transportation system , the Minister of Transport , the minister responsible for the wheat board and I met this summer on July 25 with key members of the grain industry in Winnipeg .
by working together , we will build that future .
i am honoured to be asked to represent them once again and their faith in our government is not misplaced .
Mr. Speaker , it is very clear that debate will be extensive .
agreement ON INTERNAL TRADE IMPLEMENTATION ACT
we are reducing it to zero .
we can confirm that the Canadian ambassador to Israel is being brought back to Canada for consultation .
Mr. Speaker , as a former airman in the Royal Canadian Air Force of the 1960 s I am pleased to announce today we are honoured by the presence in the gallery of veterans who manned the Commonwealth radar installations in the second world war .
Mr. Allan Kerpan ( Blackstrap , Ref. ) :
they will get everything they have a right to expect from the plan .
they are a lot different .
in the area of health care we think this government needs to move very rapidly .
that is all part of the deficit cutting picture presented by the government .
millions and millions of human beings around the world would give their last penny to share this citizenship of ours .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the remarks of the hon. member for Saint John .
it was very clear in his amendment that he was talking about a three - legged stool in which referendum was one leg .
this whopper comes at a time when youth unemployment stands at a staggering 17 percent , and by some estimates is 25 percent in real terms .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie
i am disappointed the fisheries critic of the official opposition would choose for his first question such a trivial , irrelevant and inaccurate comment as the one he has made .
now everybody may pay into this plan but a low income person might not pay very much .
in the event the school boards conclude service agreements , these agreements shall also be approved by the language councils .
my leader raised the issue with you under the provisions of Standing Order 52 .
i know they look to me to work with my colleagues here in the House to ensure the future direction of Canada .
first I would like everyone to know why I support the Speech from the Throne as presented by the governor general on the opening day of this Parliament .
their remarkably successful demonization of the public sector has turned much of the citizenry against their own mechanism .
they want their elected members of Parliament to play a more meaningful role .
these allegations are being raised ironically by a member of the Tory Party .
this Department of Finance study indicates that the Liberal tax hike this time could kill up to 75,000 jobs .
i am very surprised to hear the young member interrupted and told that he must say this or that , when the other parties are not treated this way .
last of all but not least I want to acknowledge and thank the people of Calgary Southwest .
it is because of these enterprises that it has often been said that the Beauce region is the kingdom of SMBs .
if Voisey ' s Bay is to set the precedent for other mining projects , making a full scale environmental assessment necessary before exploration is completed , we can be fairly sure that mining companies will be more reluctant to undertake new exploration projects .
as proof , I point to The Fiscal Monitor , a Department of Finance publication .
that this House refer the matter to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
i have five sisters and four brothers .
they do not want to debate for six months so the government cannot respect the agreement that we made with the provinces .
there is certainly room for government spending on such things as education , health care and funding for research and development .
the second alternative was that we decrease the benefits under the Canada pension plan .
we know that in a world of inflation , individuals find it profitable to enter financial professions that benefit from inflation rather than technological and scientific ones that promote growth .
we have indicated that now we have brought the economy under control and we are now going to have a dividend that a lot of this dividend will be put toward health care .
( f ) Finance ( sixteen Members ) ;
this may be their last reunion as time catches up .
Mr. Reg Alcock
we are destined for greatness because of the Canadian spirit .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
the difference between the Liberal philosophy and the commitment we made during the last election campaign and the Reform and other parties is this .
it is time the government made more than a passing reference to persons with disabilities .
any hard time that we feel , there is always warmth and compassion with the New Democratic Party .
this is a matter to which I personally attach a great deal of importance -
the Bloc Quebecois must , however , look after the agricultural interests of Quebec , both its present and its future interests .
Mr. Speaker , at a time when Canadians are brimming with energy , excitement and ideas , this Liberal government as tired , apathetic and unimaginative .
there are two things that we can do .
how will young Canadians move forward with a government that continues to hold them back ?
so many people argue that tax cuts are really not the thing that women want to support and that it is something men want to support .
the overarching theme of our safe communities agenda in the second red book is that building safer communities requires a multidimensional balanced approach .
as I indicated at the beginning , if the member had been present for my speech , Cape Bretoners were among the major contributors to the good things in this country .
one has to marvel at Calgary ' s energy , her productivity , and take note of how the city has grown and prospered .
i am very new to the House , but it was my understanding that we were debating Bill C - 4 today and not the recent byelection .
we are all equal , and that is what we are trying to accomplish .
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅 ( L 茅 vis , BQ ) :
Mr. Chuck Cadman :

as someone who first entered this Chamber at the age of 28 , I salute their courage and their determination .
i think not .
for instance , the youth employment strategy launched in February 1997 will provide more than 110,000 young Canadians with the work experience opportunities they need to help them get that critical first job .
i asked one of the questions last week .
nearly $ 700 billion later we call it the accumulated national debt .
the businesses in my riding count heavily on the government to stay the course and provide the stability that allows for reinvestment in the economy that will contribute in the long run to the long term creation of jobs .
Mr. Bill Matthews ( Burin - St.

hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :

since there will be no vote called for on it , it must be recorded as passed on division .
Ms. Sophia Leung
as a matter of fact , we have more barriers to trade in Canada than there are in the entire European Union .
but these scientists have a problem .
everyone recognizes that the fishermen in Newfoundland and in other Atlantic provinces have faced very difficult problems over the last few years .
it was with great sadness that Canadians learned of her recent death .
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Erie - Lincoln .
hon. Anne McLellan
at the same time the amendments leave intact the basic principles of single desk selling .
with all that we have at stake , we are going to proceed cautiously .
the Speaker :
in July , the minister was boasting about a $ 1.4 billion surplus in May 1997 .
my friend would know that while his plan was based on an example in Chile , we are suggesting what almost every European country that has gone through this process has adopted .
the Liberal government is taking the responsibility for the future direction of the plan seriously by initiating the proposed changes .
this is the party that wanted to win over Quebeckers during the last campaign by pretending to be there to defend our interests .
madam Speaker , I congratulate the hon. member .
Mr. Speaker , can the Prime Minister tell us whether on or about March 6 he consulted his ethics commissioner and whether the commissioner told him that he should not take any action with respect to the permanent employees of the Liberal Party of Canada or the employees of the President of the Treasury Board and that he should wait for charges to be laid in connection with allegations made regarding an employee of the Liberal Party of Canada around the middle of June , after the June 2 election , as perhaps the member for Hamilton is aware ?
it serves as a focal point for the delivery of market information , counselling and other support to potential exporters across the province .
who knows ?
the member says that things in the past have not worked and that I am proposing more of the same .
i will have a look at whatever information the member has laid before me .
if the government still does nothing in this area , fewer and fewer books with Canadian content will be published , because our entire industry will have been sold out to the Americans .
we have begun to see a significant drop in the unemployment rate .
at one level , this is why our future youth programs will emphasize exchanges .
he should be responsible and understand that there is a process .
hon. Martin Cauchon
the type of consultation done for employment insurance should be done for seniors pensions , but with greater guarantees that the government will listen to those consulted , who will tell us what they want in a benefits plan for seniors , so that after the Canada pension plan is reformed with the change to seniors benefits , we are sure that our seniors have an adequate pension plan .
nay .
of course we are trying to find a solution but it is not easy .
it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Winnipeg - Transcona , Trade .
we will not go for the Liberal and Reform Party position , which would increase inequity within Canadian society .
leadership is required to achieve key priorities .
will the minister admit here in this House today that this protected file was accessed in an attempt to discredit the reputation of this scientist because she is an irritant to his department ?
when I attended the referendum my distinct impression was that I was there because of a failure of our government in Ottawa to perform .
these are some of the concerns we have as this bill goes on to the committee stage .
i will find out and I will report back to the hon. member .
these areas represent the greatest potential for Canada .
however , I would like to remind the hon. member that if he looks at the very regions he is talking about that their desire to enter NATO and their desire to enter the European Union clearly points to the fact that together these groups have a much stronger presence and a much higher quality of life .
Mr. Richard Marceau :
Mr. Speaker , as the hon. Minister for International Cooperation said , the government ' s bidding is an open bidding system .
the road to that peace is through justice .
Mr. Jim Abbott
there is certainly no need to replace it with the sort of formula the Reform Party is proposing , but adjustments are in order .
Mr. Speaker , I have a petition from scores of citizens of the city and county of Peterborough who are concerned about choice in health care .
they worked long and hard for it .
then we got another driver , Prime Minister Mulroney .
this area will be improved and will be continually supported by this government because of the excellent work that has been going on .

Mr. Paul Szabo
why did the government not ensure that the minimum recommendations from that previous accident were enforced ?
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) :
the widening tax gap between Canada and the U.S. continues to damage our standard of living .
the hon. member for Erie - Lincoln can give a very brief reply if he wishes to do so .

Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) :

i will quote a farmer , Mr. John Rowett , " It is more grassroots .
i am referring specifically to the kinds of problems which we see every day in our constituency offices .
the good news is , two - tier health care is not a threat any more .

Mr. Speaker , let me first congratulate my hon. friend on being appointed the critic for international trade for the NDP .
it should put more money back into the last post fund and all the programs it has removed .
and what a lovely sight it is to see them all flocking along behind him this morning .
three years ago when in England , I visited one of those models of Gothic architecture - The cathedral was made of granite , oak and marble .
he ran his campaign on the issue of abolishing the GST , as did a lot of members in this House who sit opposite on the government benches .
unfortunately that means Canadians will have virtually no input to this place over the next few years .
it is the last Parliament of the 20 th century and the first of the 21 st century .
the House knows it is going to happen , yet this dire state of Private Members ' Business has not been addressed .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
if our real concern is to care for Canadians in their retirement , or more correctly to provide the income to permit more Canadians to care for themselves in their retirement , I urge hon. members to consider these alternatives to the government ' s approach .
Mr. Murray Calder ( Dufferin - Peel - Wellington - Grey , Lib . ) :
Ms. Wendy Lill ( Dartmouth , NDP ) :
anyone who says it is a tax grab is saying " Don ' t put any more money into it '' .

it is absolutely ridiculous .
there are currently 410,000 unemployed young Canadians in the country .
Ms. Karen Redman
Mr. Joe Jordan
one - third of nexus respondents stated that their most desirable profession was entrepreneur , suggesting that young Canadians are determined to turn their innovative ideas into business realities .
they dissected , analysed and commented on the throne speech in a way they chose to interpret it .
i respect the French culture and language .
with respect to the comments that the hon. member has made , we said before and continue to say that certainly the retirement income system of this country is an issue which we are very committed to improving .
i must , however , thank him for his very kind comments about my speech .
* * *
access as contemplated by the Canada Health Act is important to all Canadians , especially women with children and seniors who are the majority users of our health services .
in fact some of my constituents have made the comment that they think the country runs better when we are not in session .
i suggest to the minister that he remove the threat of back to work legislation and allow the union and management to seriously negotiate a collective agreement .
this meddling and duplication is unacceptable .
we have choices .
it was not the CPP that was stopping me from hiring people .
just as our health care system has suffered under this government , so has the future of young Canadians .

we will do this in partnership with provinces , communities and employers .

hon. David M. Collenette
i would suggest that this in and of itself is a prima facie case of breach of privilege .
the Liberal Party of Canada always prides itself on being the party of equity .
Chester MacRae worked tirelessly toward the improvement of Canada for future generations .
some might argue that the procedure the Prime Minister is using is in order .
CIDA puts its contract on the OBS as well .
the cost of changes will not be borne equally by the different generations , and this should be unacceptable to a government that says it is concerned about the future of young people .
i refer to it as structural unemployment .
what will they do to correct this problem ?
he must have some pretty compelling evidence to offhandedly dismiss Mr. Coffey ' s claims .

this separation was required not only to ensure the safety of residents but to provide the arterial road upgrade needed to attract new industrial and commercial investment to the area , investment that will lead to the creation of long term meaningful jobs .

all I read was , and I quote " Canada ' s rich and diverse natural heritage is also a source of national pride and international acclaim .
there is " Ajax " in there and , to me , that is stuff used to clean the sink .
let me also disagree with the content of much of his speech .
i would like to thank the prime minister for his willingness to listen to us as members of his caucus .
they are tickled pink to announce that they will soon be able to put out a fire which they themselves started .
in order to capture the hearts and minds of the people of Quebec , we must prove that Canada can work well once again , that Canada can once again become a country where economic security , sound communities , interesting opportunities and real human charity prevail .
everyone is well aware that the complexity of the matters dealt with , the complexity of the subjects the hon. members must debate in order to properly speak for their communities , require us to have access to a level of expertise such as the legislative counsels possess .

we have an absolutely ludicrous situation that has to be corrected .
we have heard vague promises of the millennium fund .
third , a producer vote would have to be held if the board of directors decided the exclusion is indeed significant .
i hope that the hon. member is not suggesting that more money needs to be spent .
while investing in our future we must still ask for sacrifices to secure a quality of life for our seniors , our families , our young people , and each and every Canadian .
we need a much more preventive medicine situation out there .
with every ounce of energy we have , with the support of our colleagues and our fellow Canadians , we will keep this wonderful country , this Canada , our Canada , united .
the questions and comments period is almost over .
one can wonder if it was not in the interest of the Prime Minister , who won his election , winning by a very narrow margin in his riding of Shawinigan , to keep this matter under wraps during the election campaign .

the Canada pension plan investment board will provide quarterly financial statements and annual reports on the performance of the fund .
it seems rather absurd to me that the second party is now thinking that somehow we are going to change all that again .

to be eligible for disability benefits workers must have made Canada pension plan contributions in four of the last six years prior to becoming disabled .
in the first instance , it was to grant the Pentecostal Church the same rights the five other churches had in Newfoundland , and to that end section 42 was used .

in other efforts to protect our social programs the government has introduced an amendment to the Canada pension plan and the new seniors benefit to ensure the sustainability of Canada ' s pension plan system .
i have another petition on a similar topic also from hundreds of constituents of the Peterborough riding who are concerned about freedom of choice in health care .

Mr. Dick Proctor
moreover , having a reserve equivalent to five years of benefits instead of just two will provide a major fund with more money than is currently the case , thus ensuring that Canadians , and particularly people of my generation , will receive retirement benefits when the time comes .
the government opposite may be full of good intentions in its speeches , but we are still waiting for concrete action .
three decades later the heartbreaking reality is that aboriginal youth commit suicide at six times the national rate , aboriginal infant mortality is twice as high , and more aboriginal youth go to jail than to university .

in the last House we had extremely significant social policy issues that crossed the floor of this House , pieces of legislation that were debated in this House without ever a question from the other side , such as the affects of changes to health care , unemployment and homelessness .
therefore the transparency for Canada pension plans of the future is the same transparency in private plans throughout the rest of Canada .
the FAMILY
the government ' s achievement in addressing the deficit was certainly a first step toward securing the future of young people , children and youth .
Mr. Speaker , in accordance with section 3 ( 32 ) of the Canada Elections Act , I have the honour to table , in both official languages , copies of a form prescribed by the Chief Electoral Officer , pursuant to subsection 46 ( 1 ) of the act .
we are more than that , and have been for some time .
RALPH CAMPBELL
these changes will strengthen our pension system so it will continue to give Canadians the opportunity to build sufficient incomes for their retirement .
i urge all hon. members to pose questions that will be of interest to most Canadians , or at least to a certain part of the country , perhaps a constituency where a specific answer is needed on something .
the first one , and he quoted a number of references to support it , is that what happens in the Senate is out of bounds in the House .
hon. Don Boudria :
i cannot find the right words .
this summer he became a Canadian citizen and represents the spirit of co - operation and partnership underlined in the Speech from the Throne .
i raised it with a member of the Reform Party as well .
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
however , I would caution the members of the proposed committee to ensure that what they are doing is in the best interests of all Canadians and not just worry how their actions will be perceived in Quebec .
rather than sell to the board , they ran to the border with truckloads of grain .
when we come back with ideas on how to correct it , I really think numbers should be attached .
we realized that we had to make the plan fiscally sound , so we began consultations across Canada .
what remains to be decided is the amount of the adjustments to be made to ensure pay equity exists in practice .
does he not think it is time he listened to the people ?
Canadians are deeply troubled by the incidence of crime , especially crimes of violence -
ports Canada police officers are specialists in their field .
however , at the same time one does not put in stained glass windows or a brick driveway instead of a black - top driveway .
it provides benefits to workers who are unable to work due to disability , and death and survivor benefits including benefits for dependants .
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
when is this government going to explain to me how it can possibly spend $ 116,000 for a committee on seniors and sexuality and do nothing for these people ?
the impact of the Canada health and social transfer is just starting to take effect like a slow release time bomb .
this plan is secure , it is indexed and Canadians should know that it is not just a pension .
it is not an income redistribution program .
in my view this is a matter of utmost importance .
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the electoral system never ceases to amaze me .
if we look at the history of relations between Quebec and Canada , part of the responsibility for this problem is yours as well .
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
( bill read the second time and referred to a committee )
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
we also have a tradition in terms of the anti - scab legislation I was mentioning , as well as a number of other similar examples .
as I said , while many people have different definitions of the work of the royal commission , fundamental to that work is a clear indication that the structural relationship has to change .
bill C - 220
yesterday at the Industry Canada open house I was thrilled to see Schoolnet and Strategis as realities , to see the national graduates registry actually putting young Canadians to work on the digital collections and consulting small business .
Mr. Speaker , I move , seconded by the member for Langley - Abbotsford :
what do they say about that ?
this is something we ought not to do as a matter of principle .
when the wheat board mandate is only to get rid of grain no matter what the price that is not accountability .
the Canadian people regionalized this Chamber in a way that they have not done for a long time .
the president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union president , local 832 , would be pleased .
i and a lot of people across this country are asking if I would not give it to you why does the government .
it is not my decision to judge either the quality of a question or the quality of an answer .
some hon. members :
for goodness ' sake , to me that is distortion .
for example in Canada we could introduce tax incentives at minimal cost to the federal treasury to encourage employees to own shares in their own company .
let us hope that the reserve fund does enough to allay that concern .
the situation is so bad that it is a rare day in my riding office that I do not hear tales of despair from my constituents .
let us change the Canada pension plan to make it a plan for the future that will enable people to live out their lives in dignity .
generally speaking , the Bloc Quebecois is in agreement with the primary objectives of this reform , with a few reservations .
canada BUSINESS CORPORATIONS ACT
they also felt that the perception of various kinds of jobs needs to improve .
there are no roads .
it has massive financial implications to individuals , to business and to communities .
when will the government do the same for unemployment and show that it is serious about putting Canadians back to work ?
that program is oriented toward some very positive things .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
clearly this has the support of eight out of ten provinces .
the Speaker :
does he and his government believe that this employment insurance system should be used for the purpose of reducing the deficit , yes or no ?
yes , we do have an unfunded liability and the country has to make some difficult decisions on how to deal with that unfunded liability .
i would not disagree with him that the mountain of debt which was accumulated over 20 years is one of the causes of the problems that he has identified .
first , interest charges .
if we are talking about 1993 , I received donations from individuals , it is true , and I received from 29 businesses and business organizations -
in the absence of the tools of direct democracy in this place we really remain captive to the will of the prime minister .
it continues to be the envy of many countries .
he is a spender .
it is totally irresponsible for a government to artificially determine optimal government size and taxation levels and then , in order to achieve it , drop the ball and allow those least able to fend for themselves to try and get by .
our effort at every stage will be to ensure that it is there to protect the safety of Canadians .
i assume members know their ridings , and the businesses in them , well .
they believe that the structural relationship the federal government has had with them is not good enough .
maybe he would concede that .
CPP annual reports will provide more complete information and will explain how administrative problems are being addressed .
as a representative of a riding that has seen its fair share of downsizing and restructuring , although the youth need jobs , so do the displaced workers .
in view of that fact , we must have evolution in the practices of the House as well .
this summer the Olson hearing as well as the 300 murderers with the right to apply for early release highlight the need for change in this area .
the local Canada HRD office , the town of Newmarket and local business and community service partners should be commended for their contribution to and support of Newmarket area youth .
it is a marvellous idea .
he has failed his unofficial pact , denied the pact , or abandoned the pact to provide some co - operation to deal with issues of a substantive nature .
i would also like to inform the people who are listening to this debate today that we are debating the Speech from the Throne .
Mr. Jacques Saada
Mr. Tony Valeri :
provincial RIDING OF DUPLESSIS
hon. Don Boudria :
my question to her is when and how .
i take part of the blame for his being prime minister ; the people of Beaus 茅 jour elected him and gave him that opportunity .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food .
Mr. Odina Desrochers
the minister says that information cannot be given out without the consent of chief and council , and the chief and council are the ones the aboriginal people with whom I deal want me to investigate .
surely it has not entered into the changes without considering the impact they would have on women .
my question was pertaining to the area licensing system that is so restrictive to B.C. salmon harvesters that they cannot make a living .
* * *
i do not think he would like his name besmirched anymore that I would like mine besmirched .
they were lucky , but the good times are finally over as we can see .
i would be more than happy to address my remarks to the Chair , Mr. Speaker .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
during the 33 sessions held in 18 cities throughout the country , more than 270 formal presentations were held to find out what Canadians thought should happen to their plan .
in true parliamentary spirit , I would like to begin by congratulating the member for Bourassa .
my riding in northern Ontario stretches from Manitouwadge in the northwest to Chapleau in the northeast and south to the north shore of Lake Huron including Manitoulin Island .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
in addition , the public would receive services from governments that are closer to them and their situation .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Ted White
the contrary is true .
however , I believe the best judge of that is the people of Canada .
the House resumed at 2.29 p.m.
speech FROM THE THRONE
the message could not have been more clear , I think .
payroll taxes will claim more and more and more victims .
now we can say that we needed no polls to tell us that most Canadians did not think that we could ever gain control of the massive deficit that had deeply wounded the economy and Canadian self - confidence .
the government is approaching a balanced budget but it has not been balanced by cutting government overspending .
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) :
their super RRSP program is a typical Reform way of looking at things : we will pay them money out of their RRSP program but if they are not able to contribute to it , tough luck .
during question period we had what I considered to be the use of unparliamentary language .
a minute ago I was talking about our democratic values .
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
in January 1997 he was given a five year reduced manslaughter sentence by successfully arguing the defence of provocation , that Susan had provoked him such that he could not contemplate the consequences of his own violent actions .
when I listened to the throne speech in the other place , I reflected back on the last number of years here .
Mr. Preston Manning
kings - Hants includes the Annapolis Valley where we grow the best apples in the world as well as the Hants Shore where the Minas Basin provides the highest tides in the world .
the Speaker :
such a marketing plan can only be set up after an association of producers or an association or firm engaged in the processing and marketing of grain submits a proposal for the establishment of a marketing plan to the minister and is approved by the governor in council .
i can say , looking at the record , that the Liberal government has moved us further and further away from that .
we have to anticipate that the baby boomer generation which hit our high schools throughout the sixties and put tremendous pressure on our school system , will , 10 years from now , hit the pension system .
because I have additional responsibilities in this area , I want to say a few words about science , innovation and technology .
the minorities will have their language councils .
Mrs. Jean Augustine :
( 4 ) to the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration
with respect to criminal justice , we look at the speech from the throne and we ask what happened to the new justice minister ' s new tough agenda on criminal justice that was announced in August .
the Reform Party has no social conscience .
we just want to find out about the projects .
this is unacceptable .
my department , besides having improved phone access and having worked with the media , will be launching a public participation process to help the communities get the kind of information they require .
i would like to remind this government that it did not win a lottery .
the data bank to be established and maintained by the RCMP will be a powerful investigative tool to help protect Canadians from violent and repeat criminals .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
by 1993 '' - he was writing just before that period - `` the rise in contributions by employers and employees had reduced employment and the participation rate in the economy by nearly 26,000 jobs and .12 percentage points respectively '' .
one question the government needs to answer very soon is what is the base line upon which it will determine what the surpluses really are .
therefore it is very disturbing for me to see imitation art displayed in stores .
not once , not twice , not three times , but four times he ran before winning an election .
therefore I suggest members of the Reform Party take note .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
this question affects not only the hon. member for Wild Rose but many of us who have bands in our ridings - and in my case I have over 20 of them - that face similar problems .
we can look at the Quebec government plan .
Mr. Speaker , I have no information to indicate that other ministers were informed , not of the investigation , but of the very general allegations .
i know that there have been in some instances rather interesting interest rates .
but government can provide strong leadership and encouragement by providing funding - and incentives - to stimulate and encourage the innovation process .
Ms. Alexa McDonough
small BUSINESS
i challenge all members , irrespective of party affiliation , to help in moulding a nation of which we can all be proud citizens .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien :
that is the shameful fiscal record of this government .
if you want to say " we the separatists " or " we the people of the Bloc Quebecois '' , that is all right , that is your problem .
i think the opposition should be very careful not to create a situation of injustice where it could drag in the mud someone who may end up not being charged with anything .
this would mean that the Canadian Wheat Board would still be able to purchase the grain from producers and at the same time operate a pool .
resuming debate with the hon. member for Abitibi .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
i am from the Miramichi .
the decision making process ought to be free of any conflict of interest or political partisanship , which was not the case with Mr. Falardeau ' s production , as we now have all the evidence we need to prove .
Ms. Beth Phinney
i talked to many young people , particularly , in the workforce at their places of work .
will there be funding with which to pay researchers ?
this message must be carried to all Canadians in every province and region .
i am very happy that my work follows in the great footsteps of the likes of Lesage and Bourassa .
that is just what he is doing with this sort of question and it is unacceptable .
it is only through responsible action now that we can avoid bankruptcy and truly intolerable CPP rates later , an increase now with a number of generations sharing the burden or an increase later for our children ' s generation .
Mr. Ovid L . Jackson
i am waiting for an answer .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
bill C - 2 - NOTICE OF MOTION FOR TIME ALLOCATION
at this moment there is no debate going on before the national assembly on the question of the Calgary declaration .
Mr. Speaker , I think perhaps it would be appropriate to recall some of Quebec ' s recent history .

Mr. Jim Pankiw ( Saskatoon - Humboldt , Ref. ) :
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
that parliament and that government also set this nation on a course to celebrate in a manner never seen before .
members
Mrs. Jean Augustine
it is money that could be used for good things but because of the profligacy of previous governments , the government is paying out this tremendous amount of money , in many cases to foreign lenders , and this imperils the future of the country .
we in the agriculture committee managed , thanks - and I say it in all humility - to my intervention and also to the support of my friend and colleague , the hon. member for Malpeque , to include in the bill a provision whereby the remuneration is fixed by resolution of the board .
i have a question for the Prime Minister .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak to the motion introduced this morning by the Reform Party , for reasons that have to do with what we have just heard from the other side of the House , namely that the government acted to improve public finances , with all sorts of figures being bandied about .
i also know that it is the responsibility of the Speaker to attend to the working conditions for all of the employees who serve Parliament here on Parliament Hill and in the precincts in the surrounding area .
we could sit back and do nothing and watch the premiums escalate as per the legislative timetable until we get to a point where we would experience a 240 percent increase .
agriculture
i just do not understand this thing about negativity .
our RRSP system is one of the most generous in the world .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
can the leader of the Bloc Quebecois tell me whether he has received considerable amounts from certain banks , that is corporate entities and not individuals ?
ACADIAN ARTISTS
* * *
it is a toll road on which we pay by accepting and carrying out our civic responsibilities .
penitentiaries
i further feel that for Canada to resolve the national unity issue we have to deal fairly with all peoples and that means looking at the aboriginal situation in a fair and reasonable way .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
this will permit the changes to take effect on January 1 , 1998 .
when will the Minister of Finance put an end to the amateurism he has shown to date in the way he is administering the employment insurance fund and setting the contribution levels ?
what we are saying is that for a tax reduction , taking the $ 5 billion surplus of the EI and offsetting it against the deficit should stop now .
Mr. Charlie Penson
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) :
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
there are many cultivated people in Quebec .
whenever I hear of another death from breast cancer I cannot help but think there might be some young child who is growing up without a mother .
it is one that the Liberal government tried in the 1970 s to generate economic growth .
it does not involve disadvantaging Canadian companies by enforcing high output standards .
that would not be productive , although it would be true .
i am optimistic of the strength of partnerships that we can build between the federal government and the aboriginal people , including other partners such as the provinces , the territories , the private sector and individual Canadians .
we in the Bloc , however , have news for the Prime Minister .
for this reason I encourage members of Parliament on both sides of the House to seek input from Canada ' s youth as we try to address the various challenges they face .
in the remaining moments I have , it would be incumbent on me to address some of the points that were made earlier today by the member for Medicine Hat .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
nays
their rhetoric and their imagery is improving .
referred TO STANDING COMMITTEES
Mr. Peter Stoffer
no , Mr. Speaker .
those principles do not just reflect the priorities of the minister or his department , they express the choices of Canadians .
Mr. Speaker , I am very proud to be here in this House in the 36 th Parliament as the new member representing the riding of Vancouver East .
youth EMPLOYMENT
why does the federal government feel compelled to get involved , with its not so subtle approach , and without any concern for the development priorities established by the locals ?
i have a question for the hon. member .
shame .
madam Speaker , I thank the former assistant director general of the Liberal Party of Canada , who in fact held that position when the allegations -
i want to know what my friend from Prince George has against finding out about the sexual habits of seniors ?
she was very effective in the last Parliament and I expect that she will be in this Parliament .
this legislation represents a significant step forward to fulfilling our commitment to a secure Canadian retirement income system .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
finally , the changes we are thinking about making to the financial support to families are along the same lines .
i was just told by the member for Whitby - Ajax that that is the Liberal way .
how can he explain today how incredibly tolerant he is in this matter which involves the President of the Treasury Board and which is under investigation ?
this legislation demonstrates that we are acting decisively to fulfil our commitment to secure this pillar of Canada ' s retirement income system .
last year the Prime Minister signed an action plan with the European Community that speaks to a strong and dynamic future , including increased trade and investment , rather than simply resting on past glories , as great as those glories were .
if the government thinks it can develop a unity position that ignores the principle of equality of citizens and provinces and more importantly , ignores practical measures to make it workable in the real world , which involves getting equality into the exercise of the federal spending and taxing powers , if the government thinks it can ignore that principle , it will be designing a unity position that will not be acceptable to millions of Canadians .
is this progress ?
as I said earlier in my preamble to one of the questions I posed to the hon. member from the New Democratic Party , indeed things in this country are getting much better .
their analysis is both false and ultimately dangerous .
at some point during the meeting he was made to leave by the official because it seemed that he was not entitled to certain information that was about to be disclosed .
hear , hear .
i think we can honestly say that just a couple of years ago the Reform Party had very little confidence in our ability to manage the fiscal framework of this nation .
criminal CODE
it is a pity , Mr. Speaker , that the Bloc leader cannot put the question to the leader of the official opposition .

north America has matured in the last few years .
we will correct the mistake at this point .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
our objective is to build on the proven strengths of our existing marketing system while enhancing its accountability , improving its responsiveness to changing producer needs and opportunities , providing more flexibility and faster cashflows , and minimizing future complications in international trade .
we evaluate and we ensure always that the funds spent are spent for the things they were in fact asked for .
Saskatchewan led in medicare ; Quebec worked effectively on pensions ; and Ontario and New Brunswick were innovative in housing .
the Government of Canada will work with our great museums , other federal and provincial institutions and with voluntary groups to develop ways to increase Canadians ' knowledge of what we have done together .
the Deputy Speaker :
Whitby - Ajax is a new riding carved from the eastern end of the proud former riding of Ontario .
hon. Andy Mitchell
we can debate its merits and the way it is constructed .
aboriginal AFFAIRS
unprecedented government cuts to programs , such as Canada ' s health care and education systems , might have improved the government ' s bottom line , but they have increasingly threatened the average Canadian ; not only average Canadians who use the public services of health and education , but all Canadians who have a job ; those who are said , from the government lines , lucky to have a job .
i also felt that the exposure to Madam Gervais and her staff with their frank conversations helped me to better understand the point of view that will be important to the future of a united Canada .
what struck me as really significant was the high degree of respect and decorum that was present during that convention .
he has asked me a number of questions .
the Bloc Quebecois said : " We want to do the right thing .
that , in relation to Bill C - 2 , An Act to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts , not more than one further sitting day shall be allotted to the consideration of the second reading stage of the Bill ; and that , fifteen minutes before the expiry of the time provided for Government Business on the day allotted to the consideration of the second reading stage of the said Bill , any proceedings before the House shall be interrupted , if required for the purpose of this Order , and , in turn , every question necessary for the disposal of the said stage of the Bill shall be put forthwith and successively , without further debate or amendment .
we in this party have forged a link of trust .
members of Parliament were disciplined , at times even thrown out of their parties for trying to represent the interests of their constituents .
canada and Perth - Middlesex rely on trade for their prosperity .
he also knows that the appellant is in a hearing right now for someone who was dismissed .
it is a sacred right that these parents hold as well , a constitutional right protected under term 17 .
Ms. Claudette Bradshaw ( Moncton , Lib . ) :
why is he afraid to stand up here and explain to the Canadian people that if 9.9 is a gouge , then what is 13 percent which his party has talked about ?
too often very competent individuals decide not to become members of the boards of corporations because they fear they could be held liable for their conduct , even if they carry out their duties and responsibilities in a conscientious and reasonable way .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
the amendments to the Canada pension plan contained in this bill will enable us to meet that challenge .
furthermore , the 1996 budget requires Canadians to convert their RRSP in the year they reach 69 , whereas in the past they could wait to do so until they were 71 .
furthermore , in recognition of the importance and of the role political parties and candidates play in our democratic system , a portion of public funds is earmarked for elections .
hon. Jean J . Charest
Mr. Norman Doyle :
there is a French Canadian culture .
i think the Reform is barking because it has been hit with the same allegations as the Liberal Party .
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia ) :
i only wish he would answer the question .
we feel that members of the House would have valuable contributions to make in the debate prior to the legislation being referred to committee .
his wife Julie and his children have given a great deal to Canada and to New Brunswick over the last 15 years .

i have this concern that Canadians do not know enough about our Canada pension plan system , the very basics of what it is all about .
here he became the leader of what he called the labour group , and the voters of Winnipeg Centre kept re - electing him year after year and that labour group kept getting bigger .
our concerns have centred on the fact that Canadian passports have been used to engage in covert operations .
i am pleased to hear from the Deputy Prime Minister that the Minister of Human Resources Development has changed the procedures in his department with respect to documents .
i doubt that we will ever live in a perfect world , but we can all work together to make it a better world and a better country .
when we came to government three and a half years ago , we realized there was a problem and so we did these consultations .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
we estimate that approximately 18,400 new breast cancer cases will be diagnosed this year and that 5,100 women will die of this disease .
what is the use of having pearly whites if your nose is dirty ?
our west coast salmon fishery is in dire straits .
we recognize that there is still a debt .
Canadians from all walks of life will not waste much time in extremist rhetoric , and they will demonstrate their attachment to Canada , I am sure .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
we propose that if a constitutional amendment proposed by a province - whether it is the constitutional amendment proposed recently by the Newfoundland Legislature or that now being proposed by the Quebec Assembly - meets these three tests , then it should be supported by this Parliament .
is not this 50:50 formula simply a shell game , like the GST promise in the previous election , to allow the government to do what it really wants to do , which is to return to excessive spending ?
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) :
under Reform ' s super RRSP we would have the situation where we could actually turn over the entire amount of the annuity to the surviving spouse .

if it is good enough to use after these people are legislated back to work , then why not make it available to the parties before the work stoppage starts ?
in the 1993 auditor general ' s report the AG said : " We are concerned that Parliament cannot readily scrutinize the user fees established by contracts and other non - regulatory means .
the French language and culture is protected by the Constitution , the charter of rights and freedoms .
Canadians will now receive regular statements about their pensions with the intent to provide annual statements to all contributors as soon as possible .
it is the endless possibilities of the future that we as parliamentarians must look toward by generously accepting new people , heartily believing in new ideas and boldly encouraging innovation .
Mr. Speaker , let me congratulate the hon. member for Calgary West on his maiden speech .
on February 4 , 1916 Canada lost its original Parliament Buildings to a horrific destructive fire .
one last question , if I may , before I conclude .
the collective knowledge of all 301 members of Parliament can be a force of benefit for Canadians .

i will let you decide which .
i was most disappointed that we did not hear any mention of this during the Speech from the Throne .

we support his cause .

my remarks were in reference to the Bloc Quebecois ' unwavering question as to whether the members on this side of the House recognize the people of Quebec .
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) :
Mr. Bernard Patry
for the desperate Algerians , and for our fellow Canadians who fear for their brothers and sisters , it is vital that action be taken .

before I get into the substance of the debate I wish to take this opportunity , my first opportunity , to thank the constituents and the voters of Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre for electing me to this assembly .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
it is the same , except the cheques have changed colour .
in education and training this government could lead the way by offering some leadership on testing in the sciences and math , wiring schools , doing everything in its power to offer access to post - secondary education which it seemed to say today .
as well , I would like to acknowledge and send good wishes to my predecessor , Dr. John English , who has moved on to new challenges while he continues his work on the anti - personnel landmine issue .
i would like to educate the hon. member on the difference between a debt and a deficit .
Ms. Claudette Bradshaw ( Moncton , Lib . ) :
the new pension plan is going to be very important to the baby boomers , but it is also going to be important for those who are 20 , 25 or 30 years old today , because this will be their opportunity to define the framework under which they will have to live in the years to come .
there are some factors which have changed which we have to take into account as we make these changes .
with the B 茅 langer - Campeau commission , they once again agreed to debate renewed federalism .
i am hopeful that the present Minister of Justice will set her fellow Canadians at ease by being a breath of fresh air and being a saviour not of the rights of our criminals but of the rights of our innocent victims .
i would like to hear what his opinion would be on how we pro - actively answer that problem .

Mrs. Elsie Wayne :
Mrs. Jean Augustine :
now that the Liberals have lost support outside of Ontario , they will see these regional development programs as a way to buy back votes .
the success of partnership in these areas demonstrates that no longer can any one group or sector effectively operate and succeed in isolation .
in our second mandate we will continue to build on what works .
we should look at the privileges of a member of Parliament with regard to the Access to Information Act and other problems .
Mr. Speaker , a pregnant 17 - year old Quebec City girl was brutally gang raped , suspended by her feet from a balcony , sodomized and confined for 12 hours , and the judge justifies a two year sentence by saying there was no evidence of bruises or physical violence .
like the French before who enjoined the land of the aboriginals , so too did the British .
the second way is the NDP ' s way , which is to say " Do not change it , do not deal with the problems and let it crumble under its own weight '' .
we are here in the House of Commons to work together to build a better future for our country .
Mr. Speaker , it is rare in fact for the opposition to see a government that has acted with speed and integrity in the hours following the allegations about which I was informed .
election campaigns are exciting for me , as for all of us , because we get a real chance to meet Canadians of every kind .
disability pensions will become more difficult to obtain .
the hon. member in his remarks scolded the government for not taking responsibility for the debt .
does the hon. member not think this is a responsible approach to meet the obligations we do have toward older Canadians ?
all the spending contained in the throne speech is funded by budgetary surpluses .
in January of this year , federal information commissioner John Grace released his report to the Minister of Health on his lengthy investigations into the tainted blood scandal .
these are low income people who earn less than $ 30,000 a year .
that is why I said that we want to see aboriginal communities become stronger and healthier .
i will compare our record of hope , opportunity for growth and confidence against their dire predictions any day , for we have delivered .
they said , " The Americans are going to take our water '' , " seniors are going to lose their pensions '' , " we are going to lose control over gas , oil and electricity '' .
madam Speaker , I guess the admiration is mutual .
Canadians are very proud of it and the Reform Party should be too .
it is one thing to say I now have enough money in my pocket to buy groceries , but I will have to use some of the money I will save to reduce the debt I accumulated over 30 years .
individuals also have to assume the risk of inflation in their investment decisions under the Reform Party ' s plan .
cuts to provincial education have left thousands of children in supposedly integrated classrooms without support .
i am sure he will hear a bit more about New Zealand from me , but that goes with the territory , I guess .
we are not dealing with monetary tightening .
the conclusions of the people of Durham are very much part of this legislation .
as well he said the government should not assist small business in any way .
one of those terms happened to be term 17 which gave rights to certain classes of people to their own religious school system .
as we said in the election campaign we can split it 50:50 , put some of it toward debt reduction and tax reductions and with the other 50 percent we will make investments in terms of social and economic programs .
i got kicked out of the House because I could not believe that was possible .
there are some who say this House will be lively in the 36 th Parliament .
the products of these three industries alone account for approximately 38 percent of Canada ' s domestic exports .
CALGARY DECLARATION
it is important to note that the commission , which is non - partisan - I hope nobody says that the Lortie Commission is partisan - , never made such recommendations .

i believe there are many improvements that can be made to allow private members more opportunity to introduce and pass meaningful legislation .

most Canadians born prior to September 28 , 1972 recall when Henderson scored what has come to be known as hockey ' s most famous goal .
we have discovered over and over again that it is the taxpayer who is probably in the best position to determine how best to spend his dollars .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the hon. member for Bourassa exhibited the pettiness and partisan narrow - mindedness for which he is already legendary , by omitting congratulations to the newly elected PQ member for Duplessis , Normand Duguay , a native of the village of Rivi 猫 re - au - Tonnerre in my riding .
Mrs. Maud Debien ( Laval East , BQ ) :
as announced in the Speech from the Throne , we will also focus on helping youth facing barriers to becoming self - reliant due to low education , low skills or other social or economic factors .
many were aware of the problems that have existed for some time with Canada pension plan .
it gives me great pleasure to speak to the motion of the member for Medicine Hat which bears repeating :
auditor GENERAL ' S REPORT
if the word you is being used as a general term and not aimed at a specific individual , this Chair thinks it is okay .
he is now back at Simon Fraser University and working with the Fraser Institute .
i would first like to give three warnings .
in his February 1995 report , the chief actuary clearly showed that without modification to the Canada pension plan , the CPP fund would be exhausted by the year 2015 and that contribution rates would have had to soar to over 14 % to cover the rapid growth in cost .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay
it is not a limitless pit as the government might feel .
i can assure hon. members that if they were to accept our partnership offer , because we sovereignists are giving them that chance , an offer of partnership after a vote in favour of sovereignty , everything the hon. member said about economic growth and employment in Canada and Quebec would be settled .
the Reform Party proposals relating to the reform of the Canada pension plan place the federal government in a similar position , since it can always answer that , in future , this plan is privately administered and is similar to the registered retirement savings plans .
that future is one that we are confident will be as a sovereign and proud country , dealing as an equal with its friend and neighbour , Canada .
we do not have to do that based on the present economy .
why on earth would we as a parliament want to make the lives of seniors more difficult in the future ?
Mr. Yvan Loubier
if one wants to talk about government policies , let us take a look at the private sector .
he speaks all this nonsense about looking after the rights of the majority when in fact he is only looking after his own party ' s platform .
Mr. Speaker , of course not .
we are directing it to them in co - operation with the provinces to break down the welfare wall .
on February 17 , a letter of approval from the MP was added to the file , in occurrence the letter I wrote to back the project , and it would appear that a very important meeting took place on February 25 .
YUKON WEATHER STATION
i consider it a great honour to stand in this House to represent the citizens of Nepean - Carleton .
there are some who advocate scrapping CPP and moving to a privatized system with mandatory retirement savings plans .
i do not care as much about the corruption in the Liberal Party as I care about corruption in the government .
however it is not clear that it would be acceptable to use the section 43 amending formula to remove a restriction from one provincial government when that restriction is still in place for every other provincial government in the country , since this would have the effect of extending the powers of one province into an area henceforth outside the jurisdiction of any other province .
Mr. Speaker , the people of Dartmouth and of Nova Scotia are very concerned with the blended sales tax which is the son of the GST .
it is not too direct a market competitor for the Caisse de d 茅 p 么 t et placement because it does not actually have an economic mandate .
his points were well taken and I look forward to his continued participation in the debates of this House .
it also makes for good times for watching the ships slide through the Welland canal or to go rowing on Martindale pond , the future site of the 1999 world rowing championships .
we further propose the achievement of a better balance for the provision of retirement income between the Canada pension plan , RRSPs and the seniors benefit by means of the following pension and tax reforms .
in accordance with Beauchesne ' s reference No. 116 on page 29 I would like to table that document with the House .
this is a great price for them and their families to pay , to have to forfeit a well deserved vacation to serve their country .

the danger to the investor is he sees that whatever tax relief Ontario gives , the federal government will move in to that tax room and the taxpayer will never see it .
in its July 1995 statement , the government wrote that the CRTC should not deny operating licences to companies providing direct satellite broadcasting services for reasons of economic viability .
many people who had planned their retirement based on an existing plan will face a situation different than the one they expected , simply because the government has decided , with this bill , to protect those aged 59 and over .
in fact his father was here a good many years before I arrived in 1988 .
the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the United Nations last week had extensive consultations with Arab governments and the Arab language press to assure them that there was no complicity on the part of Canada in this incident .
this means that producers will have a larger and more direct voice in the way in which their marketing system operates .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
that is why we have cut the size of government and federal program spending by more than any other government in 50 years .
finally , we will focus as always on the determinants of health because the best way to ensure that we have sufficient supply of health care is to reduce demand .
when they were in government did they not realize this was coming to fruition ?
thanks to the lack of foresight by the government during the 35 th Parliament , we have to partially repeat the work the hon. members had done in this House on Bill C - 72 .

hon. David Anderson
Mr. Speaker , my next question is for the Prime Minister .
for me it is a humbling experience and I admit an emotional occasion to take my place in the House of Commons , to continue that struggle for a more democratic and a more social democratic Canada .
Mr. Rick Borotsik
the House should check with the people of B.C. , just like the Vancouver Sun did with its readers .
the Government will help build a partnership among governments , communities and citizens to mark the new millennium .

comments during Question Period
let me put on my glasses because I would not want to misquote and thereby cause some real serious disruption on the opposition side .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
the Leader of the Opposition was concerned about the clawbacks in the old age pension system .
we have that now and that is what is creating the 4 per cent growth that we will have this year in Canada .
Mr. Fraser loved this Chamber .
he may not be aware , because he was not a member of the House in the last session of Parliament , but my predecessor as minister of justice made significant reforms to section 745 .
concealment is definitely the name of the game for this government .
Quebecers want to be a part of this great country .
Mr. Speaker , I was particularly impressed with the comments from the MP for Kent - Essex saying that the pension plan is not a tax grab by the government , that the funds that would be put into the pension fund would not be used for purposes other than pensions .
we want to know the remuneration of the executives .
the hon. member for Calgary - Nose Hill .
madam Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the member for St. Paul ' s .
during the time leading up to the writing of the Speech from the Throne , the prime minister invited members of our caucus to make submissions to him , both written and oral , concerning the contents of the Speech from the Throne .
when I became Leader of the Liberal Party , we reviewed the policy and we adjusted it .
the amendment would simply prevent repeated and unnecessary mischief without consequence .
let us look at job creation .
could the member give us an idea of the impact on small business of this drastic increase in CPP ?
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I am pleased to present a petition signed by 396 people from the riding of Bruce - Grey and area .
spending on Indian and northern affairs is now more than $ 6 billion a year which , as someone worked out , is the equivalent to $ 32,000 per annum for every man , woman and child in the aboriginal community .
in 1993 - 94 , our program expenditures amounted to $ 120 billion .
i do not see the relevance of that point to what we are discussing today .
we need more women in Parliament .
we will never agree to Quebec separating from the rest of Canada and I will never agree to be separated from my family .
Mr. Reg Alcock ( Winnipeg South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Joseph Volpe
francophones
we have often pleaded with the government to reduce employment insurance premiums .
this government must now stiffen its resolve and meet its responsibilities .
one loses the sense of true dialogue and communication , respect and putting a new face on politics .
we want to find out whether they are businesses that will create jobs meeting the riding ' s socio - economic needs .
the transition from the present CPP to our super RRSP , which is what we have called our Reform plan , would take some time .
they built our Confederation , the physical structure of our nation and the social infrastructure for our citizens , pensions and medicare just to mention a couple .
surely the hon. member knows that because there is an investigation it would be inappropriate for me to speak specifically to that investigation .

while families have the greatest responsibility in the nurturing and development of our children , they are not alone .
on the contrary , the history of the party he and many of his colleagues supported before the Reform Party , namely the Conservative Party , has always been one of protectionism and building up the walls .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
fully two - thirds of the men and women who chose to cast a ballot on June 2 voted for me and the Reform Party .
first , the fact that , in 1993 , he received contributions from corporations and , second , did he come in direct or indirect contact with Pierre Corbeil , who is accused of influence peddling , of having solicited corporations for cash and of fraudulent practices ?
Mr. Speaker , on Friday I asked a question of the Minister of Transport about untendered contracts on a highway 104 project in Nova Scotia which is being done under a federal - provincial agreement .
it is sponsored by the Canadian Automobile Association .
all the hon. member has to do , rather than standing here and making a bit of a dope of himself in the House of Commons , is a little research and he would understand what is going on .
i am not talking about only small or medium size .
but it would still allow the Canadian Wheat Board to continue its activities under part III.
Mr. Speaker , let me thank the hon. member for his question .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien :
i would suggest that the government discard the same tired ideas that have been used over the past 20 years and put some faith in the judgment and ideas of the industry and individuals they were elected to represent .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Minister of Canadian Heritage released a first report on the new television and cable fund for the production of Canadian programs .
as Canadians we must focus our attention and resources on nurturing and developing industries in which we can compete and in fact do lead the world .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Malpeque , Lib . ) :
during this Liberal government we went into debt another $ 100 billion in the last term of Parliament .
we have seen across the country , in particular in Quebec lately , a practice in backroom politics called tollgating .
i heard that the federal government is going to raise the pension contributions again .
on behalf of the constituents of Dauphin - Swan River I wish you a very successful term .
since he made that statement his government has slashed health care transfers to the provinces by 35 percent .
they request also that the only foods the Government of Canada may restrict from the market are those which are proven unsafe or fraudulently promoted and that in all cases the burden of proof shall be on the government .
i am honoured to have the opportunity to serve them for another term .
that being said , however , the Chair has often expressed its reluctance to interfere in the affairs of committees unless difficulties arising in the committee are put before the House by way of a committee report .
in such circumstances , licences to export feed barley to the U.S. would likely be granted with no charge for buy back , although there might well be conditions imposed to ensure that such feed barley exports would not adversely affect the Canadian Wheat Board malt barley exports to the U.S.
many Canadians worry that some of our most fundamental institutions and values , such as health care and the Canada pension plan , might not be there for them and their families when they need it .
in his speech in reply to the Speech from the Throne , the Prime Minister urged Quebecers to put their trust in the Calgary declaration , the ramifications of which became even murkier yesterday with the replies the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs gave to our questions .
it was beyond comprehension what those families were put through in those four days .
it is nonsense to throw that red herring out and say that Reform ' s proposals are no good because somehow they will not handle disabled protection the same way as the Liberal ' s proposals will .
allegations of influence peddling have been pouring down on the Liberal Party of Canada and on certain individuals in key positions within the government .
as you can see I , too , have just been apprised of this matter .
every Canadian should live in dignity for the long hours and days they have worked .
while section 93 does not protect linguistic rights , language and denomination nevertheless have close historical ties .
the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois are simply saying their way or the highway .
i would like to take some time .
one in three Canadian jobs depends on trade and every $ 1 billion increase in exports generates 8,000 new jobs .
so what if our debt is one of the biggest in the world ?
Ms. Marlene Jennings
canada ' s capital markets are mature , well developed and growing .
Mr. Speaker , the talks that are occurring right now have nothing to do with a harmonization agenda .
it is an interesting idea but I do not think we can table an idea like that on the floor of the House of Commons unless we can link some dollars to it .
i formally invite all of you to meet them and to speak with them right after question period .
the Reform Party claims to be the party of families , a fact which is quite disputable .
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration .
part IV also provides for monopoly control over interprovincial trade of wheat and barley which has , of course , long since been removed for domestic feed grain .
let us understand that they want to have some of the $ 13 billion EI surplus .
it is a pity , Mr. Speaker , that the minister cannot answer the questions put to him .
i am really concerned about the rapid escalation of the premiums for a number of reasons .
it would have been better for the local government body closest to the taxpayer to be responsible for collecting that money in the first place and spending it on the infrastructure directly .
Mr. Bill Gilmour
he would put a for sale sign on the car and would refuse the $ 49,000 stipend that he receives .

during the summer I collected a folder full of issues brought up in letters and later some phone calls from my constituents .
it hits people when they are paying for diapers and heating oil , although it does not hit people when they are paying for $ 400 suits .
we need to sort this out and to balance it out quickly before there is some real social stress that will cause difficulty in our country .
a few farmers who were stubbornly opposed to the board had earlier chosen to break the law .
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to ask for leave to put forward a motion for a special debate , pursuant to Standing Order 52 , to discuss the critical situation facing the fishing industry on the Pacific coast and in Atlantic Canada and recent events which are causing the government to revise its policies .
constituents in my riding are tired of this continuing debate and they want to put the national unity issue to rest .
canada PENSION PLAN
if that is so , why are seniors throughout Canada very nervous about the changes being made to the CPP ?
health Canada is committed to continuing its involvement with other stakeholders in public and private organizations , to deal with matters concerning arthritis and how to treat its sufferers .
Mr. Speaker , may I say to the hon. member that his brilliant reputation as student and teacher has followed him here .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :

Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to introduce this bill .
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 202 , an act to amend the Canada Health Act ( nutrition services ) .
the government even admits in the throne speech that it has the means to improve our children ' s lives and that it intends to invest in their well - being .
hon. Allan Rock
Mr. Speaker , when you exaggerate to that point you certainly render yourself insignificant .
Mr. Speaker , Senator Andrew Thompson is one of the reasons why Canadians have such a low opinion of our upper House .
motion
Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) :
i look forward to the committee ' s discussion of this bill .
it requires focussing on what children need to thrive .
further , the Government will redouble its efforts to ensure that rural communities and all regions of Canada share in the economic benefits of the global knowledge - based economy .
if the electorate so wishes , the system also presupposes an opposition ready and willing to attack the government in an attempt to have its legislation altered or rejected - .
the difficulty is that many times Canadians are appalled at the choices they make or the people who they assign to make the choices of the projects .
resumption OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the President of the Treasury Board .
anything that happens in CPP requires the approval of two - thirds of the provinces , representing two - thirds of the population .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅
the opposition motion reads as follows , and I want to be absolutely sure to read it correctly .
this reform will ensure that future generations will also have access to a public pension plan .
health
amendment negatived
the Speaker :
Mr. Speaker , I can assure the Deputy Prime Minister that the role of the Conservative opposition members is to help provide Canadians with good government .
i know that is a very difficult task , given the fact that one has to make a lot of sacrifices to be in public life .
Mr. Randy White :
he got a little confused there , if you will .
i do not believe the government has even begun to do that .
it is what we choose to do in this place , not the fact that we are in this place that transforms shared values into actions .
let us talk to the real record of this government , the record the government was applauding this afternoon .

Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
this silence has made it possible for the tragic events that took place in Benthala , Algeria , over Monday night , to occur .
amendment to the amendment
instead of condemning the fact that Bill C - 2 wanted reporting he really should have gone after the bill and said that this is the kind of reporting we want .
i would also like to take the opportunity to thank all the voters in my riding who enabled me to be in this House .
this time it is not the Red River that is rising , it is the rising tide of desperation in our inner cities .

in rising to speak on the first throne speech of the 36 th Parliament , which will be the last parliament of this millennium and the first of the next millennium , I do so with humility and with tremendous optimism for the future of our country .
appointment OF DEPUTY CHAIRMAN
petitions
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) :
in other words , the government has failed to transfer money to the provinces and again the provinces have to pick up the slack .
Mr. Speaker , that certainly was a classic NDP speech .
at the Industry Canada open house last week there was a national graduates registry .
dare I hope that , during his parliamentary career here , the member may consider the other path , that of renewed federalism , adapted to the needs of the modern world ?
Mr. Speaker , the code of conduct applies to the government and to public servants .
one of the things I noticed was that he did not talk about health care .
here again there should be a debate because the federal government has not been putting a cent into this fund for years , yet merrily helps itself to premiums paid by employers and employees , hence the need for a real public debate .
Mr. David Price
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
for about two weeks now , the opposition has been putting questions to the government , but the ministers either refuse to answer or give evasive or contradictory answers .
you mentioned that the member for Wild Rose has a grievance , but you ruled that he did not have a case for contempt of parliament .
that is embarrassing surely to the government , it is embarrassing to this House and it is embarrassing to Canadians .
the Speaker :
i hope that my colleague is not saying that if it was not all repaid that it was a total failure .
how can that be a benefit to children and grandchildren ?
Mr. Speaker , the modifications that are proposed to the CPP will of course shrink a certain number of benefits .
sitting resumed
we call on the government to end the rhetoric and to put into action accessibility as a national standard and to show leadership by providing the financial commitments to assist students today .
who would have thought 130 years ago when this country was founded that as a consequence of the work of these generations of men and women that we would pass on to our children today what is viewed as the most valuable passport in the world , in a world that is globalized , in a world where more than ever people travel -
what is the Minister of Transport waiting for to appoint a federal representative to the Tardif commission on the future of Mirabel ?
i am very pleased to see that happening .
these changes will only come into effect on January 1 , 1998 . Benefits will not change for those who are currently collecting a pension and those who will start doing so before the end of this year .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :

my colleague , the member for Medicine Hat , has been circulating a discussion paper entitled " Beyond a Balanced Budget '' .

three , clear evidence demonstrating to this Parliament that Quebec ' s educational reforms do not prejudicially affect rights previously granted and thus in no way establish precedents which may be damaging to minority rights in Quebec or in any other province .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
it is by far the single biggest payment the government makes each and every year .
Canadian farmers need to know that their interests are being considered when decisions are being made by the federal government .
for example section 22 ( 1 ) of the Manitoba Act corresponds to section 93 ( 1 ) and uses almost the same wording , but it contains a further restriction on the province ' s freedom of action .
the Speaker
it contains that famous place called Punky Doodle ' s Corner .
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the member ' s preamble , with all due respect , but I do not quite understand the question .
i suppose we might as well blow another $ 49,249 on a cross cultural study of semiotic management and transformation of facial features in the makeup and masks of performers or $ 20,000 to examine the ecclesiastical courts of 19 th century England or $ 35,000 for a study on craft industries in post - medieval Iran .
the LATE MR. J . CHESTER MACRAE
i look forward to debating this issue and earning the support of my colleagues throughout the House .
we will do so in a responsible manner by applying one half of any budgetary surplus to the social and economic needs of Canadians and the other half to tax reduction and the national debt .
if young Canadians knew that each dollar they put into a retirement plan would go into their own personal account and that they would receive it back , including a fair market return on the investment , they would gladly accept the plan and even leave some portion of their premiums to pay the present beneficiaries .
would the hon. member explain how he reconciles those two positions ?
i urge my friend in the Reform Party to consider all producers .
however , with the current financial environment such a policy cannot be expected to deliver the best investment performance over the long term .
it has actually increased spending on social programs by almost $ 1 billion in the last year .
people want to know what we will do for them in the future .
what is our charming Minister of Finance going to do with the surpluses he is generating ?
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
he was a member of the Progressive Conservative Party and represented my riding over 40 years ago .
at the present time , over 1,500 food banks and hundreds of soup kitchens are waging the fight against hunger .
he was also a great parliamentarian in terms of the real love of this place .
a Canada - wide mentorship program will be created in partnership with the provincial governments and the private sector .
Mr. Speaker , Reform has just learned that the conciliator in the Canada Post labour dispute filed his report with the minister last Monday .
that is why a Progressive Conservative government would apply one - third of all surpluses after the year 2000 to debt reduction .
but the Senate does have some constitutional powers .
in 1929 I was born in the Dominican Republic to British parents .

the deficit is vanishing , interests rates are low , unemployment is decreasing , productivity is up and there is a new sense of optimism .
this appointment of Michel Bastarache is the worst of the government ' s political appointments .

for the benefit of the Minister of Health I would like to table the document indicating her files were accessed by Mr. Joe Losos , Assistant Deputy Minister of the Department of Health .
i think the member for Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke is one of those , and he should be made aware of it .
what does this mean ?
this is what is so revolting .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
that is basically the philosophy behind the plan .
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , there has been $ 182 million cut from the Department of Veterans Affairs ' budget .
some hon. members :
this Parliament must focus on rebuilding that kind of Canada .
our government is taking the lead by making amendments to the act and by putting the Canada pension plan on a sound footing .
there was the cancellation of the Pearson airport privatization and the cost of putting that political quagmire to bed or at least partially tucking it in .

conservative Premier Mike Harris and his environment and health ministers have backtracked , flip - flopped on their pledges for an inquiry , citing the pathetic excuse of the need for evidence of wrongdoing .
trust me , I know because I am a chiropractor and the most common complaint I hear in my clinic is that taxes are too high .
can the minister tell me , does he condone his department ' s decision to wait some 24 hours to report that Machell did not report to his halfway house ?
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
government EXPENDITURES
one of the things that the government does have to take a look at is a reduction in taxes .
people are waiting longer and longer for less health care .

i will take that under advisement .

Mr. Murray Calder
in the late eighties and early nineties the economy of Etobicoke - Lakeshore suffered as companies felt the impact of the recession and the economic policies of the past government .
Mrs. Francine Lalonde
i am reminded of those who came before us in this fight , Ms. Pat Kelly and the Breast Cancer Action Group who fought hard to overcome systemic barriers to raising money for breast cancer research but , more important , fought to gain a voice for women in determining how breast cancer research dollars would be spent .
i personally do not want to gloat about them .
on the other hand when it comes to medication , in this case for migraine headaches , he says that there is not sufficient regulation , or the health protection branch is not interfering sufficiently .
i would like to in the next little while show some of that positive criticism .
before suspending the sitting , may I bring to the attention of members that when the counting of the ballots has been completed , the bells to call the members back to the House will be sounded for not more than five minutes .
that Mr. Ian McClelland , member for the electoral district of Edmonton Southwest , be appointed deputy chairman of committees of the whole House .
such a situation would not benefit anyone , and certainly not Quebec students .
Mr. John Richardson
the Tories asked the British Prime Minister not to apply the results to a simple decentralization because -

CPP contributors will continue to receive death benefit payments under the plan , but again the benefit will continue to be based on six months of retirement benefits .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
we need inspiration and leaders who can lift us up .
we have had very little light shed on this debate today .
if there are suggestions that the member wants to put forward , I am all ears .
the Prime Minister has just appointed Michel Bastarache to the Supreme Court of Canada , not long after this same Liberal government had appointed him to the New Brunswick Court of Appeal .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
it was very clearly stated in the platform .
he made some comments about what the throne speech said about that .
i know she has waited a long time and I hope she will stay for a long time too .
to my knowledge no one in Saskatchewan is entertaining the notion of separation , but we can certainly sympathize with the frustration that is contained in that expression .
i do not recall any consultation with the people of Canada asking them how they wanted to spend any surpluses .
Paul Henderson ' s goal was an unscripted athletic event that helped define what it is to be Canadian .
these take many forms , but in these plans the contributor personally owns the contribution and the accrued growth .
why do they repeatedly point out the terrible waste and even corruption that goes on in Indian affairs and nothing ever seems to change ?
Mr. Michel Gauthier
that really demonstrates clearly that we are taking the matter very seriously .
* * *
the fact that the Bloc insists on mentioning names -
the announcement that the government , working with its partners , will develop a national plan , time table and fiscal framework for setting up a system that guarantees access to medically necessary drugs , and will also support home and community care , shows that the message sent by Canadians about public health care has been received and understood by this government .
all those opposed will please say nay .
we will help rural communities diversify their economies and capitalize on new business opportunities by supporting their efforts to identify and build on their strengths to acquire and use new technology and to strengthen small and medium size businesses to create new jobs for rural Canadians .
they say it stands for crazy political promises .
therefore , we want to make sure that we get the best helicopters for the best value .
instead it is really an attack on a concept of balanced government .
in this same community , we are struggling to cope with a health crisis that results from poverty , an epidemic of HIV transmission among injection drug users .
this provision will facilitate the removal of internal trade barriers and present growth opportunities to Canadian businesses which previously have been restricted by these interprovincial trade barriers .
the petitioners request a number of specific amendments to the Food and Drug Act which would ensure that health foods and dietary supplements are not defined and regulated as drugs .
the result is there is better productivity and greater profits .
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) :
let us be clear .
Mr. Speaker , once again under these Liberals we see the voices of Canadians being trampled under the hooves of a government that clearly prefers dictatorship to democracy .
that the quorum of the Committee be twelve members whenever a vote , resolution or other decision is taken , so long as both Houses are represented , and that the Joint Chairpersons be authorized to hold meetings , to receive evidence and authorize the printing thereof , whenever six members are present , so long as both Houses are represented ;
hon. David Kilgour
the rules were changed , which radically changed the operation of the institution .
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
let it look at some of the more far reaching international experience and start looking at super RRSPs .
Mr. Pierre Brien
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
their incomes will not be increased by one cent .
a third of every tax dollar that Canadians send to the treasury each year goes toward paying the interest on the debt .
when is the hon. member and his party going to learn from the mistakes of the past ?
they are about getting the best we can from Canadians and they are about giving the best we can to Canadians .
rather than including that amount in the transfer payments to the provinces , the federal government is using its powers of taxation to interfere in the delivery of home care , an area that comes under provincial jurisdiction .
he made an enormous contribution and I am sure that his son will do exactly the same thing .
Mr. Yvan Loubier :
this happened to be one of those where there was a lengthy question and a lengthy answer .
it is an idea which builds on the agenda presented in the Speech from the Throne and one which would effect real change in the perception and effectiveness of government .
i have a few things to say .
prostate CANCER
the Pic River First Nation feels that this legal review was seriously flawed and they are seeking an independent legal review of their land claim .
i will not need to make another trip to the library .
we want to know the cost of administration and management .
the success of our government ' s efforts with this project is very dependent on partnerships which involve industry , educators , governments , individuals and communities .
i attended Saint - Jean - sur - Richelieu in the valley of the forts and I was instructed about the history of that area .
when the government has a vision shared by Canadians , when we are convinced that we have the right things to do , only then can we set the goals and then go about achieving them with innovation and partnerships to ensure they happen .
the bill requires mandatory counselling prior to legal sanction or granting of a divorce , not to try to reconcile a broken marriage but rather to serve two purposes .
a senior federal official is negotiating with Quebec so that the two offices , the employment centre and the unemployment office , are as close as possible and even sometimes share the same location .
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Kitchener - Waterloo , Lib . ) :
yes it pertains only to Newfoundland but does it have precedent application for other provinces ?
Mr. Brent St. Denis ( Algoma - Manitoulin , Lib . ) :
i am quite happy to say that the search for better government was not exclusively Liberal .
that is the role of the government .
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay
i also congratulate the Speaker on his re - election as Speaker of the House of Commons for the 36 th Parliament .
since the government has known this problem has existed for 10 years , why has it done absolutely nothing about it ?
addressing the causes and cures of child poverty are also vital .
their memory is so selective .
so said Jean Lesage in 1963 .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
they are aware that if it is left untouched and unchanged , the plan will implode .
the member , a respected economist , knows full well that this constant irritant , constant threat of destroying this country is a disincentive to investment which is really hurting those constituents looking for jobs .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
our challenge as members of this House will be to understand the roles that we as individuals can play in bringing our communities together , municipalities with First Nations .
that is an important thing for us to find out but of course there have been questions arising from that .
the hon. member from the NDP talked about accountability and equality .
they proudly watched as their pet department grew into a strapping example of government largesse .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
i am sure she understands as a physician that it is very important not only to treat the symptom of a decease but the actual root of the problem .
reformers are reluctant to convey any legitimacy to that unelected upper Chamber by working with them on a special joint committee .
it seems to me at the outset it would be important to ask ourselves precisely what did Canadians do on June 2 and what message were they endeavouring to send by what they did .
with this in mind it is imperative that we no longer live in the past , that we move forward into the future .
the Speaker :
at any rate , these changes , this new set of measures will not take effect , first , until Parliament passes the legislation , and second , until the necessary orders are approved by two thirds of the provinces representing two thirds of the Canadian population .
it has to do with the whole role and relationship between minority rights and the role of the majority .
this is one of the soundest investments that we can make for job creation and for our young people who are graduating .
Mr. Speaker , many of us are concerned that any constitutional amendment passed under section 43 or any of the other provisions might set a precedent .
the points the member makes are legitimate , but I was simply trying to point something out for the purposes of historical accuracy and , for that matter , for a kind of emotional accuracy .
one can imagine how Mr. Attias feels after such an experience .
some hon. members :
in keeping with tradition , I would like to thank the electors of Abitibi who put their trust in me for the next four years .
Mr. Speaker , the objective of the Government of Canada , as with all the other players in the potential Voisey ' s Bay development , is the development of an environmentally sound project whose benefits are shared in a responsible manner by all the key stakeholders .
we have undertaken to at least double that investment as soon as resources permit .
this approach would allow us not only to comply with parliamentary procedure but also to promote a better understanding of the changes that would be effected through this constitutional amendment .
we have to take a completely different approach .
first , what amending formula is applicable to this particular case ?
i will spare no effort to meet the challenges it will present .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
for their part , trust companies contributed more than $ 35,000 each .
Mr. Peter Mancini :
in light of the very serious problems being experienced on the west coast and the east coast of the country with fisheries and after being in office now for four years , when can we expect a national policy on sustainable fisheries ?
i am sorry , I apologize to the House .
i was astonished to see this government allowed this important question , the environment , only two short paragraphs .
i am contributing my culture to make this country better and stronger .
industry will need to recognize sustainable growth as the opportunity that it is .
Mr. Pierre Brien
how can an agreement , which I feel is impossible , ever be reached ?
we can lead the way from the scourge of unemployment , for a good crime prevention program is low unemployment .
i would like us to be able to debate serious issues such as that one , and there are others .
the problem we have with unemployment is that over the last many years we have devoted billions of dollars toward the problem of training people for employment and we still have abnormally high unemployment rates .
if we take that right across the country into every community , large and small , what will that do to those seeking employment today ?
Mr. Dick Harris
all of Quebec ' s premiers , be they federalist or sovereignist , from Daniel Johnson senior to Robert Bourassa , have defended these three principles .
Mr. Speaker , I think one has to reject the premise of the hon. member ' s question .
hear , hear .
but of course to Liberals anything west of Ontario is extraterritorial .
those chosen as partners will be the blessed ones and the entrepreneurial interests of others will be left at a competitive disadvantage .
the bill proposes to change that requirement so that to be eligible for the benefit you must contribute in four of the last six years .
we are going to be consulting with Canadians over the next three months to gather their input .

as I look across at the benches I think that unfortunately this government may find the truth I am about to convey unpleasant , I hope a little unsettling .
the Conservatives had to increase premiums from $ 2 to $ 3.30 , at a time when unemployment was on the rise in Canada .
Mr. Peter Mancini
if the member will be slightly patient , we will make sure that the continuing programs are in place , as was always intended from the beginning .
i said yesterday that no preferential treatment is given to FedEx .
it should invest in areas that will result in some additions to the economy in terms of new jobs , new research , various affirmative action programs or programs to assist young entrepreneurs or young people to enter the job market .
i should not have to tell this to the Bloc leader .
Mrs. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) :
that is how one financial analyst started to tell investors around the world about Canada .
this country has spent over a century discussing nation building .
but it is the chief who is the problem .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
in 1993 the whole nation knew that the deficit was $ 42 billion .
yesterday afternoon at 3.30 there was a meeting in which I asked all members present , and all parties were present , whether or not they intended to put more speakers .
i was delighted therefore to note that our throne speech committed our government " to work with the provinces , universities and colleges , the high tech industry and other rapidly growing sectors of the economy to better forecast the number and types of jobs that will be available and to develop a plan for ensuring that young people are appropriately educated to fill them '' .
first of all , in my speech , which I also invite this member to read , I never excluded francophones outside Quebec .
in response to an earlier question from across the floor I did indicate there may be merit in having a broader consultation process to help me in making my recommendation to my colleagues in the government .
and I suspect that certain companies in my riding coughed up money .
Mr. Speaker , I want to congratulate you on your recent appointment .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy :
Nunavut ' s high Arctic hosts two lead and zinc mines .
for over a week now the government appears to have been in the dark on this issue and has been keeping Canadians in the dark .
it reflects the fundamental fact that in today ' s fast evolving , global economy there are initiatives that must be taken on a national scale .
in the early 19 th century , Louis - Joseph Papineau and the Patriot movement fought for democracy and for the rights of those who were called Canadians at the time and are now known as Quebeckers .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
all the opposition parties could settle the issue within a week by proposing legislation whereby only voters could contribute to a political party ' s fund .
that does not stop us from recognizing across the land that some youth unfortunately have not been well served in school or did not find in their families or in their societies the support that allowed them to go far enough in school .

the original deal on helicopters was not just a purchase but an opportunity for Canadians to co - develop proprietary technology for the EH - 101 .
this creativity is pushing the highway to new limits in a demand driven expansion .
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia ) :
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) :
i think history will judge him very harshly .
throughout the years that he was a cabinet minister and the premier of Alberta we operated a dairy farm east of the city of Edmonton .
i think the minister at the time and the minister who remains today tried to take into account every aspect of the operation of that board before he made any recommendations .
Mr. Eric Lowther
the Quebec pension plan administers a similar plan , but the fact remains that both in Quebec and elsewhere , Canadians believe that this plan is very important for their future .
the federal government even seems to want to reserve the right to draft and impose its referendum question during the next referendum .
more than 250,000 Canadians have attended these institutions .
this is typical of the hypocrisy of this government .
we invite the ideas of all opposition parties , and we will have an opportunity to discuss them either in this House or in committee .
it is still evolving .
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the President of the Treasury Board .
the government plan is to assure that every Canadian regardless of his pocket book , when he or she retires , will have the opportunity to live with dignity and not to live in poverty as the hon. member from across the floor would have it .
my submission to you , Mr. Speaker , is that if we as elected members of Parliament to this House of Commons are going to have ample opportunity to debate the fisheries crisis on both coasts of our country , we are going to need to do it soon .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
part of the reason we see this subtle attack on this institution and government itself is that some in the private sector know that if they can shift that responsibility then they can profit by doing so .

some hon. members :
i want to join with members in acknowledging Mr. Ellis ' contribution to the city of Regina , the province of Saskatchewan and to our country .

i want to express our wholehearted support to Mrs. Hayes and her husband .

here is one that I should not be upset about but I am .
Mr. Speaker , I move :
i presented the program of the Reform , the program of the NDP .
this is the country that is admired worldwide .
when members raise questions of privilege they usually lay whatever information they have on the table .
such a marketplace would provide the information products Canadians want with the best service for the least cost .
i will certainly abide by the ruling of the Chair .
the hon. gentleman will know that there are a number of players .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
it seems blind to the fact that the debt in this country is $ 600 billion .
i have risen to respond to the throne speech because I care deeply about our country and I despair at the kind of leadership and competence observed from the government .
Mr. John Reynolds :
for the government to move at this time as I suggested earlier is a very unfortunate thing .
even if current forecasts are incorrect , the previous pay as you go system which had today ' s workers paying for today ' s pensioners will be overhauled to become a fuller funding system , where today ' s workers will pay for today ' s and tomorrow ' s pensioners and will have nothing for themselves .
[ editor ' s Note :
no matter , the Bloc Quebecois is there to ask the real questions and that is why we are presenting today an opposition motion on this extremely important matter .
there is for example nothing on national transportation and only the barest of references to agriculture .

bloc QUEBECOIS LEADER
Mr. Speaker , we are glad to see that the finance minister is making up with the prime minister .
Mr. Dick Proctor
we have no problem with the government naming some members to the board of directors .
has he forgotten that , while the Conservatives were in office , Canada ' s public debt doubled from $ 250 billion to $ 500 billion ?
the CPP premiums are insurance premiums paid by working Canadians into a public pension plan from which they draw benefits when they retire .
they should be ashamed .
they are not happy about the lack of jobs , the rising cost of post - secondary education , the dismantling of the health care system , the price of grain as announced recently by the Canadian Wheat Board , the cost of transporting farm products to market , the political manipulation of the grain transportation system over the last 40 years , an ineffective Young Offenders Act , and the lack of justice in that criminals appear to have more rights than law - abiding citizens .
the real problem - and the minister simply does not address it - is that many bureaucrats in this department started out idealistic and got into this matter to try to help aboriginal people .
they wanted to show the prime minister and the government how poorly they are working on behalf of Atlantic Canadians .
in 1993 , in the heat of an election campaign , the prime minister made a hasty campaign promise to scrap the purchase of 43 maritime helicopters needed to replace the Department of National Defence aging Sea King and Labrador helicopters .
perhaps I should commend her for her interest in this matter .
the Speaker :
they view it as simply another tax being imposed upon them by the government .

hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :

Mr. Garry Breitkreuz
they are consistent with some of the comments we heard from the minister earlier .
we are living every day with the consequences of a provincial government which has no vision nor values ; a government that continues to transfer power to unelected officials and ignores public opinion and referenda ; a government that does not believe that it can have a positive effect on people ' s lives and whose sole purpose is to cut taxes ; a government that forgets that Canada is a big cold country and as John Ralston Saul has said , a country whose people agreed over 150 years ago that they would have to look after one another .
this government must give all Canadians access to the tools of economic growth , as the Minister of Industry said earlier this morning in the House .

Mr. Daniel Turp
by the introduction of closure on Bill C - 2 , the Liberals are saying one of two things : that the Liberals just do not care if the Canadian people are concerned about the biggest tax grab in the history of this country ; or that the Liberals just do not want the Canadian people to find out exactly how destructive these new pension proposals are .

Mr. Speaker , I would like to respond briefly to the question of privilege raised by the House leader of the New Democratic Party and supported by two other members of this House earlier this day .
with respect to the broad based dialogue , as I have been out talking with constituents in my riding and with Canadians right across the country the one message that continues to come back as a result of their experience with the broad based consultation on the Canada pension plan is that they want a broad based dialogue on the pillars of the retirement income system .
call after call for responsibility to ensure that we did not rack up a massive unfunded liability , a massive taxpayer IOU , was not heeded by successive Liberal and Tory governments .

Mr. Speaker , this problem in terms of the baby boom generation coming up and creating a bulge in the Canada pension plan is something that has not been hidden from anyone .
we are not trying to encroach on the fundamental rights of the provinces , as the Bloc Quebecois is accusing us of doing , but rather to help my province , Quebec , develop within this flexible federation .
right now , the provincial governments have made a joint decision to consult the people before adopting resolutions in their respective legislatures .
let me say to the hon. member that he has nothing to be proud of .
we think market forces should be responsible .
there are many barriers that stand in the way of our youth attaining higher education .

Mr. Speaker , will the minister admit that the fact that more than one third of all contracts are awarded without going to public tender is giving the business community the message that they better make generous donations to the ruling party if they hope to get a share of the pie ?
Mr. Pat Martin :
i want to give credit where it is due .
in that election our government looked to the day when , thanks to the foundation we put in place with four years of consistent effort and tough decisions , the federal government will no longer need deficit financing .
that means that 40 percent more of the Canadian public will be looking for publicly funded pensions and seniors benefits that have been promised .
the Speaker :
Mr. Denis Coderre
that is what I am saying and I am prepared to argue my position in any forum and debate it with the minister in the forum of his choice .
they were also very concerned that those who are already in or near retirement not be affected because they had based their retirement planning on the expectation that the CPP would be there for them .

i do not have the information for the member right now , but we will get back to him very soon .
after all , why would we plunge the nation back into bankruptcy after we have worked so hard to free it from the deficit burden ?
that is nice .
the minister has the authority but will he have the political will ?
someday the federal government will be an enabler rather than an oppressive tax taker .
in fact , I am absolutely thrilled about the future .
of particular note is its wish to maintain national unity .
it will be difficult to touch on them all .
we have the disabled suffering unconscionable bureaucratic delays as they attempt to obtain disability pensions under the Canada pension plan .
it should immediately stop implementing its planned budget cuts , as set out in the 1996 budget .
i believe there is a lesson to be learned here .
as someone who as worked on the issue of youth employment for a number of years , I am encouraged by the fact that for the third time in three months youth employment is up .
canada owes 25.3 percent of its debt to foreigners .
it will begin this fall with an economic statement by the Minister of Finance laying out where we are and some of the available options .
the present government shows absolutely no respect for our senior citizens .
Mr. Speaker , in February the Minister of Finance said a 5 per cent jobless rate was not only achievable but desirable .
when we fail to invest sufficiently in the early years of child development , the country ' s future economic prosperity may suffer in two ways .
with this objective , this second conclusion falls in line with our first one .
it really bothers me that that type of thing can happen .
many market opportunities are missed because of full train cars sitting on the wharf , empty ships in the harbour and the wrong grain in the train cars .
i rise to address my colleagues in the highest forum in our country and in so doing I acknowledge with considerable humility the great honour and privilege which has been bestowed on me by the people of Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford .
it is nice of them to say that we have to do this and we have to do that , but if we are adding debt and debt we will never be able to implement any of the programs such as the scholarship fund .
fifty thousand dollars , especially in the Toronto area , is not very difficult to collect .
look at the dilemma the member for Wild Rose and I are in .
the fact that we will be reviewing the CPP every three years ensures us that we will be well ahead of any changes and able to address any problems that are developing on a more timely basis .
those things included health care , education , unemployment and in particular , youth unemployment .
they are based on high unemployment rates and the very flat wage increases we have seen over the past few years .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to take part in this debate .
i would suggest to you , Mr. Speaker , that a prima facie case of privilege exists and with your permission I would like to move the motion :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for the question .
that is why we have to act now .
my question is for the solicitor general who has already attempted to address this issue .
tourism and particularly the gambling industry fuelled by Casino Windsor have become extremely important .
petitions
i think the Reform Party should compliment the government for doing something for a region that needs it .
in the Journal de Montr 茅 al of September 25 , one could read this : " Chr 茅 tien on the front line " and " Ottawa to create large scholarship fund '' .
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate the member on her maiden speech .
our country is moving forward .
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
* * *
it is certainly true that no one likes to talk about a new tax , be it in Parliament or anywhere in the country .
i personally attended Clifford Olson ' s 745 hearing .
we feel , and you have demonstrated to us , that you have all the qualities required for the important job of directing the work of the House .
the Progressive Conservative Party has put forward a co - operative approach to fixing the health care system through a Canadian covenant .
i myself have never witnessed anything like that and I find this kind of thing appalling -
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
departments must speak to each other in a consistent single message .
could the environment minister tell us why the Canadian petroleum producers have not been invited to Kyoto ?
buying helicopters will probably be a more important initiative than helping young people afford education .
hon. Don Boudria :
Ms. Diane St - Jacques
maybe the hon. member should -
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for the question .
go on .
the Speaker :
when you knock on a door to ask for a donation of $ 10 or $ 20 , the people who answer are tempted to say what they truly think about politicians , politics and the government ' s actions .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
we consulted all Canadians from sea to sea on the future of the CPP and on Canadians ' vision for the future of the CPP .
and more than five members having risen :
the problem of internal trade barriers is one that will take imagination and courage to overcome .
it will always find new ways .
the Atlantic premiers deserve our commendation for their vision in undertaking this project .
the truth of the matter is that we live in a country called Canada which is acknowledged as the greatest country in the world in which to live .
indeed , had corrections not been done , we would have ended up receiving benefits for which we would not really have paid premiums and nothing would have been done to ensure that younger people do not have to pay disproportionate amounts for what we , the so - called baby boomers , will be entitled to in terms of benefits .
he is not interested in investing in Canada , and no wonder .
they were supposed to scrap it .
yet memories of hardships and prejudice experienced endure .
sure , that is spending money , but it is also investing in the future of our young people and in the future of our country .
before the government agrees to any reductions in greenhouse gas levels , ordinary Canadians and the provinces must be in agreement .
i most strongly agree with the recent comment of the opposition member for Esquimalt - Saanich , a medical doctor who has seen landmines tear apart human bodies and who has worked with us to achieve the ban .
( the House divided on the motion , which was negatived on the following division : )
the hon. member for Rouyn - Noranda is right when he speaks about the Raglan mining company .
agreed .
i know Lucien Bouchard .
Mr. Speaker , I remember in 1967 the Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup and 90 percent of the team was made up of older players who brought a wealth of experience and knowledge to the team .
Mr. Jack Ramsay
my question is for the Minister of Transport .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate hearing from the hon. member for Kamloops .
agreed .
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
i encourage the member to be very clear when he communicates with the constituents of his riding and other Canadians across the country .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
the Speaker :
( b ) Agriculture and Agri - Food ( sixteen Members ) ;
some hon. members :
* * *
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) :
Mr. John Cannis
we need to continue to use the leverage of this successful program to ensure that more products with high growth potential in key sectors reach the world marketplace .
how can the minister justify making Canadians pay more in CPP taxes when he has actually admitted that his chief actuary of the fund has said that there is no guarantee that increase will give the return that Canadians have been promised ?
i move :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of the Environment .
the burden of this tax grab will fall most heavily on young Canadians just entering the job market .
he asked for an investigation as soon as he learned of the allegations .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
a safe and just society is valued by my constituents and by all Canadians .
Susan Klassen may be just a name to us , but she was Brenda ' s sister , a friend , an aunt .
we must ensure that we have a fair and equitable taxation system .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
i for one think that is a pitiful sum of money to shut down an entire system and a tradition that has always been a part of this country .
when the House broke for question period the hon. member for South Surrey - White Rock - Langley had eight minutes remaining in questions and comments following her speech .
how are we going to offer services to people who have no car , who must travel , who will have to go to one place and another , while trying to cut costs , to reach a consensus ?
Mr. Speaker , the employee in question has filed with the Public Service Commission Board an appeal that he was denied an appointment .
they say that if the convention is fully implemented government bureaucrats and the courts will have absolute power to determine what is in the best interests of the child and parents will be powerless .
as a result it affected the bottom line of the fund historically .
Mr. Speaker , since the February 1997 budget , there has been talk of the Foundation for Innovation and its magnificent $ 800 million budget .
the proposed amendment not only makes it possible to adapt the Canadian Constitution to take account of the deep - seated changes Quebec society has undergone , but it also has the merit of allowing for the changes sought by the vast majority of the citizens that are affected .
it is not appropriate , however , to create a precedent which would allow Quebec to be exempt from the law of the land .
they will be the subject of ongoing consultation through debates in the House and through the finance committee .
what they fail to recognize is the changing circumstances that guide our practices .
the world is growing ever more competitive by the day .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
i just wonder how as a new member in this House with experience and an interest in this very important area she answers that .
what is the rationale ?
Mrs. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) :
now that we have five official parties in the House , this Parliament will work better and all regions of Canada will be better represented in the 36 th Parliament .
we want the government to come clean .
this we have started to do with the creation of the health transition fund .
because of that and because of the changes we are bringing forward in the House , and the definition of the people who are eligible to make this application , have caused us some problems .
i would point out that Singapore has had this plan or a variation thereon since 1955 .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
the President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure has the floor .
if the federal government had been truly consulting Canadians it would be acutely aware of our regional differences .
Mr. Speaker , we have been waiting to debate the CPP thing all summer .
Nepean - Carleton has been blessed with some excellent members of Parliament , both Liberals and Conservatives , people like Dick Bell , Gordon Blair , Walter Baker and Beryl Gaffney .
yet this government is the only Liberal government in the developed world which seems to think that the old policies of the welfare state are the ones that can sustain a healthy and prosperous economy .
the people of Canada have clearly demonstrated that they respected and trusted the commitments of the finance minister , continued prudent management and staying the course on restoring Canada ' s fiscal health .
moreover , $ 6 million will be invested over three years to transform the economic base of the area and promote technological development .
how will this affect married women who are in relationships where their income will be judged on family income , not their individual income ?
and well thought legislation
he did that to ensure , and rightly so , that the practices were not going to continue .
i wish to congratulate the hon. member on her election .
let me tell you what we can do together as Canadians and parliamentarians .
i join with my parliamentary colleagues to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on your ascension to the Chair .
we are talking about a large coalition .
it was the only proper course of action to clear the air and assure Canadians that the justice department is not staffed by individuals who will violate the judicial independence of our courts .
CALGARY DECLARATION
madam Speaker , I will try to be brief and serene and just say a word or two as to why the NDP caucus will be supporting the motion to send this matter to committee .
i know all hon. members would want to hear the answer .
my wife tells me that my excitement is greatest when I am around young people .
a third reality is that Canada ' s social programs need reform .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
Mr. John Harvard ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) :
Mr. Jerry Pickard
Mr. Lorne Nystrom :
the question now is why this new investment policy is necessary .
there was a social context in my riding , and in most cities of this country , where street prostitution was not pervasive because there was a legal context which prohibited it .
if we do not deliver what we say then down the river and out into the lake .
i acknowledge their support over the last four years , in particular in the last election , that returned me to this assembly .
but if we look at the world , that is clearly the minority opinion .
there was no consultation .
let me say also a few words about public attitudes on criminal justice issues as they relate to this subject .
during this next mandate , defending Quebec ' s interests will have to involve defending Quebec ' s democratic institutions .
according to the example provided by this country , however , the administrative costs of such a system are far higher than for the present ones .
the Speaker :
Mr. Dennis J . Mills ( Broadview - Greenwood , Lib . ) :
the cultural sector represents a significant part of the Canadian economy .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
compared with today when 68 % of working age women are in the workforce , in the past , when the CPP survivor benefits were designed , most women did not work outside the home .
they also hear things like the plan is bankrupt or it will not be there for them when they get to retirement age .
departmental spending has been cut by only 9 per cent over the last four years .
consequently , is the government prepared to amend the Employment Insurance Act to ensure that children from families affected by the reform are not sent off to school on an empty stomach ?
this requirement is meant to help ensure that the CPP fund ' s entry into the equity market proceeds smoothly .
when I see that the government has invested $ 2 billion in Canada student loans , which is a 57 percent increase over five years , I am quite proud of the fact that as a government we realize that accessibility to education is extremely important in increasing job prospects for youth .
in the Speech from the Throne the government announced that it planned to go ahead with the seniors benefits , which discourages retirement savings , attacks middle income seniors and earners , and punishes women .
now that we have dealt with the crisis in its early stages , we are going to be reviewing post TAGS in the next year to work in partnership with the provinces and the stakeholders to come up with some long - term solutions to the problem he asks about .
hon. Paul Martin
it will hurt getting young people to support the Canada pension plan .
they will not be able to patronize small businesses .
in parliament 35
he stated that the government is playing games .
i have talked a little bit about some of the things that the government did not acknowledge .
i look forward to debating it in the House .
the Deputy Speaker :
hon. Diane Marleau ( Minister for International Cooperation and Minister responsible for Francophonie , Lib . ) :
for the safety of the men and women who fly these helicopters , we sincerely hope we will never reach that point .
the Reform Party is listening and I pledge to my constituents and fellow Canadians that we will be continually pressing the government to address these and other important justice issues .
i firmly believe that we stand for that view of equality .
Mr. Jacques Saada
i wonder whether the hon. member could tell us how much of the moneys that were handed out under DIPP have been repaid , at what rate and what is the interest that has been repaid to the government .
past incidents reflect this aggression with numerous staff assaults , two hostage takings and two riots since August 27 .
i thank my husband and my sons for making my decision such an easy one and I thank my parents for their commitment of hard work and commitment to the customer .
the Somalia inquiry pointed its finger at the department of defence bureaucrats who deliberately prevented the release of pertinent information .
first of all , who are these producers ?
it is easy to see that there is a direct link .
we could also compare ourselves with what happened provincially with our counterparts in the province of Ontario who believe that to slash and burn is the way to go about things and at the same time wind up at the end of the day continuing to perpetuate a deficit .
we hear today of a poll out of Quebec suggesting that the majority of Quebeckers do not believe that the Calgary declaration is sufficient to address their concerns .
we recognize it as a unique society .
we have admitted that we are not able to achieve those targets , but we are trying to work with all our partners in Canada and abroad to make sure that we achieve realistic targets for the future .
is this minister in charge of his department and its policy or is this minister ' s department in charge of him ?
Mr. Speaker , I have a little fish story for the House today .
the secrecy surrounding the prime minister ' s intentions is alarming given the serious impacts that such a cap would have on the Canadian economy .
yes , this mission is a real success .
i heard about one tier , two tier and three tier .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie
if they put full maximum contributions into the CPP they will get only $ 8,800 a year .
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , I have the honour to present the following petition .
Mr. Speaker , once again , we have made over $ 1 billion in equity payments in recent years .
there are other issues but I see I do not have time to touch on them .
the fact is , and this is a continuing dimension of the debate which is frustrating for those of us outside of Quebec , it was a family fight .
i hope I have succeeded in outlining the importance of this committee .
Quebecers voted no for change .
by paying that cost now we will save ourselves and our children from larger , more expensive hikes in the future .
madam Speaker , I would like to begin by thanking the hon. member for Abitibi because he told things that I did not know , for example , that we can borrow a donation .
* * *
worse yet , no one is speaking about them or for them .
if Quebec is not bound by section 93 ( 1 ) , the Superior Court of Quebec should rule that this proposal will have no adverse effect on minorities in Quebec .
as I was speaking to a Reform motion I happened to become aware of a statement by a former Reform MP from Simcoe Centre .
though gasoline is a Canadian natural resource , Canadians have little control over this important resource .
Mr. Dan McTeague ( Pickering - Ajax - Uxbridge , Lib . ) :
we must never neglect any individual or any region .
madam Speaker , as a quick comment on the final remarks of the previous speaker , I suggest this is the Wheat Board Act .
they are counter to the initiatives taken by the President of the United States and the Prime Minister to dismantle controls at borders and to promote the free circulation of people and of goods .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
* * *
they can count on my support .
in order to provide taxpayer protection we must pass legislation to cut the pay of the prime minister and cabinet ministers if they break this deficit band .
again , who , in this House , can claim that , in Quebec or elsewhere - but we speak for Quebec - there is a link between the religious convictions of individuals - which we respect , given their noble character - and school boards ?
they do not know who they can trust .
having witnessed the Tory government destroy the Atlantic fishery a few years ago , this government seems intent on doing the same to the Pacific fishery .
the people of Edmonton East are just like the people of Gasp 茅 and people from all across Canada .
that kind of integrity and dishonesty are a discredit to politics in this country .
the purpose of the amendments is to respond to some of the major concerns raised during the debate and to ensure that the CWB is well positioned to continue as a reliable , responsive single desk seller of Canadian wheat and barley in the years ahead .
the funding system for political parties in Canada is simple .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in Canada several economists say that the long term natural rate for unemployment is well over the 5 per cent that the minister is talking about .
in due course we will act .
what is that going to do , that $ 10 billion tax grab , the largest single tax increase in Canadian history ?
they are very generous people who live a very modest lifestyle .
Mr. Speaker , we had to cut spending .
canada is a land of immigrants and the current right of landing fee placed on people coming to Canada in addition to their application fee is discriminatory and regressive .
Mr. Monte Solberg
justice
let us talk about the pension plan as hon. members across the way want to keep talking about it .
the member for Wild Rose was not present during the discussion of financial issues which was provided to individual members of the Stony band , but he was present during the briefing by DIAND staff of the initiatives being taken to address the situation at Stony .
petitions
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
i know the hon. member is an experienced member .
Mr. Speaker , in response to the question , the people he is referring to were all investigated as a result of the issuance of a warrant by the court .
perhaps he would like to have a copy of it .
it was with great disappointment that I noticed the almost complete absence of any substance toward rectifying the inadequacies of our criminal justice system in the throne speech .
what about the north , our last frontier , demographically and ecologically ?
Mr. Bill Blaikie
i forget who it was that said a few years ago that you can tell an awful lot about a society when you see how it cares for its children and its elderly .
there is one thing I want to mention in answer to the question put by the hon. member for T 茅 miscamingue .
introduction and first reading
when will the hon. member talk seriously , Madam Speaker ?
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
i applaud that company ' s courage in deciding to make such a move under the circumstances , because we must not forget that its application had not been approved yet .
one would not have to be a rocket scientist .
other people too require some vision , require some leadership from the government .
* * *
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
the member for Edmonton North made a very strong accusation the other day and she did not even know the difference between Winnipeg and Montreal .
that means ensuring that young Canadians know what education they need to get a job in high growth sectors of the economy .
i take my seat today , the latest in a long line of people who have been sent to this House by the people of Winnipeg Centre to fight for social justice .
the hon. member for Wild Rose has explained that this matter touches upon his preparation for questions to the minister .
Mr. Gary Lunn ( Saanich - Gulf Islands , Ref. ) :
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) :
government EXPENDITURES
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Mr. Tom Wappel
( the sitting of the House was suspended at 1.13 p.m. )
there was the introduction of television , which again changed the way this place operates .
does the President of the Treasury Board intend to comply with the upcoming decision of the human rights tribunal in the matter of pay equity ?
as J . Arthur Lower the historian put it , the once vital era of Macdonald sputtered to a dreary conclusion after the death of its guiding spirit .
Mr. Speaker , the prime minister is doing it again .
Mr. Speaker , at a press conference this morning Dennis Coffey , a 25 year veteran of Revenue Canada , repeated his allegations of serious fraud , nepotism and abuse on the part of senior Revenue Canada officials .
does he consider the abnormally high rate of unemployment among young people to be normal ?
the government therefore views its mandate in that area in a global and encompassing fashion .
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I may have shortcomings , but being intimidated by the premier of Quebec is certainly not one of them .
it seems like more of the say one thing , do another approach of this government .
free TRADE AGREEMENT
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
what are they to think when they hear and see this kind of conduct on the part of these officials ?
Mr. Speaker , I wish to congratulate Justice Michel Bastarache on his appointment to the Supreme Court of Canada .
nevertheless , things in this industry are on a better footing these days .
the Speaker :
the government is 30 years too late and $ 580 billion short .
will the member opposite , who is boasting because he is a government member , tell us here whether or not his government recognizes that Quebecers are a people ?
if he is referring to conditional sentencing provisions that were put in place by my predecessor , that legislation deals with an array of crimes in which it is possible to have those who are sentenced to do time of less than two years but in fact are -
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
it is our first opportunity to engage in this place , and I suspect it will be the first of many .
does he mean by this that it is not by asking our fellow citizens on a daily basis whether we are unique , whether we are distinct , that we will succeed in improving national unity ?
he taught me something and I thank him for that .
when these rules are tabled , a thorough review will have to be made to avoid any injustices .
canada is the best nation in the world to call home and we have that privilege .
Mr. Speaker , each provincial government will decide what form of consultation it will use .
i will return to this point in a moment .
back in 1992 Statistics Canada issued a report which stated that the debt in this country , some 50 percent , was created by high interest rates ; 44 percent of the debt from tax breaks and only 6 percent by government programs .
that is why we are increasing the industrial research assistance program , or IRAP , to promote the diffusion of technology throughout Canada .
the information given is not proven because I do not know of anyone who is under investigation .
Mr. Speaker , I really want to thank the member for Saint John for that question .
i would like to point out something that I found very interesting .
it is my contention that DIAND should be renamed the department of Indian and northern dependency .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
it is too bad that the message has not come through yet , but the Canadian public can look forward to us telling them over the next four years what a terrible job the government has done and what a terrible thing it is about to do , spending more money when it could be saving the dollars it has .
hon. David M. Collenette
he said :
the passport affair in Jordan was unfortunate , but this is an even worse situation .
i find that to be terribly disappointing .
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to be back in the House , and I am not just talking about Stornoway .
why will the prime minister not permit more debate before he makes mistakes that Canadians will have to live with for the rest of their lives ?
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
i see him sitting on the steps over there so he can see what is going on .
osteoporosis
Mr. Speaker , given that the government ' s policy is to create jobs , and that this can only be achieved in a strong and growing economy , I find it hard to understand the Bank of Canada ' s decision to increase its rate , when there is no indication of a rise in inflation .
some hon. members :
on Tuesday , September 30 the first draw for Private Members ' Business in the 36 th Parliament was held .
to hear John Polanyi on Sunday night talk about the reverence with which he holds that fund was truly heartening to me as a Liberal member of Parliament .
to touch on a few of those contributions , I remind the House of Sir Frederick Banting , as was mentioned earlier , the co - founder of insulin and a World War II hero .
it must be said that the Prime Minister knows that , for us , the national unity issue is not partisan .
i believe she will agree that major contributors to her profession are scientists , researchers and people who have worked to find new ways of dealing with and preventing various diseases .
in fact , we will balance the budget no later than the fiscal year 1998 - 99 .
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) :
some hon. members :
it goes on and on .
yet he himself said yesterday " I am advised this clause has been used and the courts have allowed it in the past '' .
this was a result of consultations which our federal finance committee undertook and suggested and the Minister of Industry adapted .
auditor GENERAL ' S REPORT
finally , I am aware suggestions abound that the British Parliament uses legislative clerks to fulfil the function of legislative counsel and by extension the same could apply here .
much work will stand before us to implement the treaty , but December 1997 will be a time of celebration , a time of hope .
we must do more .
as we know , last spring the auditor general sharply criticized certain practices in the present administration of the CPP .
Mr. Speaker , I wish to add to this point of privilege .
Mr. David Chatters ( Athabasca , Ref. ) :
what has changed in the meantime ?
the government will work closely with provincial and territorial leaders to advance the progress made in the Calgary declaration .
in closing , it is my deepest hope that years , many years from now when my successor rises in this House for the first time , it will be to speak of our natural beauty and the prosperity of our people and not the economic and social disparity that we face today .
i would like to take this opportunity to thank on behalf of all Canadians the valiant , self - sacrificing efforts of the members of our nation ' s police forces .
specifically in the throne speech , once we get beyond the decision to spend 50 per cent on new programs and the decision seemingly to spend 50 per cent on tax reduction and debt reduction , we encounter the actual words in the speech .
this is not an abortion issue but deals with an extremely serious issue occurring in our country .
specifically , I will do two things .
this bill would provide stiff penalties against any person who improperly destroys or falsifies government records in an attempt to deny right of access to information under the Access to Information Act .
we will always have unhappy participants before the CRTC because somebody wins and somebody loses .
the impact of changes to the CPP go beyond the financial consequences now or even the security of our retirement .
some hon. members :
the regulations from the department regarding information release , referred to by Mr. Jobin , state that information may be released if written consent is obtained from the applicant , which I had received .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
the nation was created in 1867 by people of vision , men and women who were prepared to hold out a helping hand , to say that together much can be accomplished , but divided little can be achieved .
now we have the MAI , with still more protection for investors than that provided by current free trade agreements .
producers will have the opportunity to make major management decisions such as excluding certain types of grain from the control of the board .
why is it that things never seem to improve ?
this month we went further by committing $ 90 million to create a public service youth internship program to complement the other internship programs in science , trade , First Nations , non - profit and private sectors .
Mr. Peter Adams
i guess history will have to judge , make a pronouncement in due course on the validity of the arguments he presented .
this was a warm , rich and prosperous place , a place of plenty .
in conclusion , too often it is easy to talk about the negative or the work to be done , but I cannot help but to think that we as Canadians get too wrapped up in it .
i do not blush as a government member to warn my government that I am dissatisfied with this aspect of the bill .
i believe that Mr. Harris has participated in Calgary with other premiers who have moved forward in their attempts to achieve the just resolution which I spoke of earlier in recognizing a uniqueness in the province of Quebec and a uniqueness in its society .

Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
medically assisted reproductive techniques give rise to a number of questions : ethical , moral , religious and scientific .
Mr. Werner Schmidt
Mr. Speaker , I would remind the hon. member that one of the amendments my predecessor made to section 745 was a device called judicial screening .
hopefully I will elucidate on the reasons I am speaking today in support of this wonderful legislation to amend the Canada pension plan .
Mr. Speaker , I will reiterate and hopefully it will be clearer this time .
the reason some of these people do not have jobs is because of payroll taxes .
since 1995 many deportation cases have been initiated and I am confident we will continue to pursue war criminals to the fullest extent of the law .
here , once again , they were having standards and views dictated to them , while the provinces were the ones that knew what they needed in the area of health .
i have a question for the member .
hon. Sergio Marchi :
i am confident that you will uphold the integrity and the proud tradition of this position .
what is being created here is a huge pension fund that will be $ 126 billion in six years and up to over $ 300 billion after nine or ten years .
i congratulate President Paul Speck and General Manager Gerry Ginsberg on the festival ' s endeavours .
this afternoon , the Prime Minister announced a new scholarship program .
that is absolutely disgusting .
Mr. Speaker , we are obviously aware of what the auditor general told us in his report and we have also noticed that he asked us for certain information that already appears in the government ' s budget each year .
in another two years the budget will be balanced .

Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) :

with respect to taxes this government should not put up with the shameless rip off of employed Canadians , of the working poor in this country , who are being gouged because the government is using the employment insurance fund to pay down the deficit .
it is ridiculous .
Mr. Denis Coderre
Mr. Werner Schmidt
they particularly dislike being told by distant government what is best for them and how their earnings should be spent .
at the time , only 9.9 per cent of the members of our armed forces were women .
they are very significant .
i commend the government for its apparent commitment to our country ' s natives , but other Canadians require attention as well .
i know the people I spoke with during the election campaign , the people who have the risk of potentially being unemployed .
the ages of eligibility for retirement , early , normal or late , would be unchanged .
the first opportunity it gets to show that it could be comprehensive , sensitive and respond as a totally responsible opposition it tries to pretend that the government has been irresponsible .
too often we forget , or do not know , what we have achieved together .
the federal government has entered into agreements with the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador and other provincial governments that families that are receiving social assistance will not see any of the child tax benefit increase at all .
introduction and first reading
the question is on the amendment .
i am thinking of things like deficit reduction , taking the deficit from $ 42 billion down to a balanced budget which is now within sight .
BRITISH COLUMBIA
consultation with the various provincial authorities is also in question , as four provinces and two territories are presently before the courts challenging our federal government on this legislation .
Mr. Andr 茅 Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) :
i do not know whether they know the same thing is happening in the national parks , their hospitals , their health care system .
Ah when to the heart of man
Mr. Speaker , early in the summer an Alberta judge called for a crown investigation into the social and economic conditions of the Stony reserve because of the serious problems in his courtroom .
our government today received and released an independent KPMG study that shows that when we compare Canada , the United States and five leading European countries , the best cost of doing business anywhere is in this country .
we will be working closely with appropriate partners to help in the actual design of the fund .
there has always been a debt reduction and servicing account where people could make gifts to the crown , supposedly to reduce the debt .
however , I did not say we would .
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
( the House adjourned at 7.17 p.m. )
my Reform colleagues who will also be speaking today will be examining various aspects of these issues in more detail .
at all times an open mind is required .
Mr. Speaker , this government has made it very clear from the beginning that it is our intention to bring in tax relief .
we have one member from Manitoba who carries a rather onerous responsibility of representing western Canada for that party .
Mr. Ted White
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
were those seeking the nomination at the time informed of the situation by Mr. Corbeil ?
because of the generous social programs , older Canadians have had a lot of advantages that younger Canadians cannot even hope to have .
Mr. Bill Matthews ( Burin - St.
madam Speaker , I too would like to congratulate my colleague from Churchill on an excellent speech .
madam Speaker , I sense that the hon. member does not know a heck of a lot about what he is saying .
i believe we can work together .
we have the social health and safety transfer which is block funding to the provinces which allows the provinces to spend the money in any way they want .
there is more to it than that .
second reading
that is a procedure they enjoy every day .

our plan calls for individualized accounts which means that individuals own all the assets in their account and can leave them to their survivors , while still protecting the benefits of retired and near retired Canadians .
our challenge is to ensure that no Canadian is left behind as the country moves forward .
they have been represented since 1988 by Beryl Gaffney as the member of Parliament for Nepean .
i hope it will be more focused on substance .
in the 21 st edition of Erskine May it is stated at page 125 :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to say it is a real pleasure to discuss the bill in the House but I cannot .
i welcome the Liberal caucus to the area of free trade .
although I am sure there are Canadian exporters who have done very well , it is also true that we do not know to what extent the low value of the Canadian dollar is really the key determinant in much of this success .
he also sat in on many meetings in Ottawa .
most of this change concerns increasing the role of an MP .
we need to give children the best start possible .
Mr. Speaker , I find it very interesting that my colleague opposite , a member of the Bloc Quebecois , is telling us what to make of the election results .
they were actually scheduled to end in April 1997 .
some hon. members :
similarly if producers wish to add additional grains to the wheat board ' s mandate , this too could be possible subject to three specific conditions .
he was thrown out of his party and sits now in this House as an independent .
the legislation will make it more difficult for people to access it and they will receive even fewer benefits .
i for one am a passionate person .
when the government says to the people of Canada that it may one day reach a surplus situation and that it is going to spend half of it , panic sets in .
it was 11 o ' clock in the evening in the hallway of the sixth floor of the Centre Block .
i respect those who promote Canadian unity , who find some degree of comfort in the Calgary declaration and who believe in its potential to produce a reform satisfactory to Quebecers .
the residents of my community overwhelmingly support the retention of a Canada pension plan .
in my opinion the yeas have it .
in a family equality means that sometimes we have to have solutions that are meeting the needs in one part of Canada but which are not needed elsewhere .
the hon. Minister of Finance .
we hope the government ' s decision to postpone the replacement of these helicopters , at an enormous cost to Canadian taxpayers , will not have unfortunate consequences .
as they go around their constituencies making representations about the Canadian Wheat Board , they will suggest that the legislation allows inappropriate activity to go unharnessed and unabated .
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) :

this is politically motivated nonsense .

they have been asked in good faith on behalf of concerned Canadians both at home and abroad and deserve a reply .
Mr. Dale Johnston ( Wetaskiwin , Ref. ) :
Ms. Angela Vautour :
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy
the reality is that , if this government can point to a balanced budget today , it is because it has made deep cuts to social programs and abandoned its responsibilities to the provinces .
the opposition motion put forward by the Bloc Quebecois asks the House to condemn the attitude of the government , which refuses to introduce in - depth reform of the legislation on the financing of federal political parties even though the existing legislation allows for a wide range of abuses .
( 18 ) to the Standing Committee on Transport
Mr. Bernard Patry
they have given us the framework from which to begin a nationwide discussion on Canada ' s constitutional future .
that is the Reform approach to helping low income Canadians .
if a stronger consensus in favour of a constitutional amendment thus emerges it will be surely helpful to the Quebec government as it charts a new course for the educational structures in the province .
i was concerned about the dramatic change which occurred over the period of a couple of weeks because another person had taken control .
i congratulate the Bloc for the motion .
the Speaker
in Newfoundland we have the highest level of unemployment and therefore the highest requirement for training .
Mr. Yvan Loubier
last week Premier Bouchard dared the prime minister to consult Quebeckers on the Calgary declaration .
she came with her husband and said " It will cost us $ 700 more , Mrs. Wayne .
that was the suggestion from the Reform Party .
in order to accomplish this , federal and provincial governments consulted extensively with Canadians from coast to coast to coast .
what became of the nice principles they were so proud of in the red book ?
agreed .
it is important to note that this action will only be taken in situations where a co - operative agreement between the provinces has been sought and has not been reached .
Mr. Claude Drouin ( Beauce , Lib . ) :
its only mandate is to ensure that the funds are managed as well as possible .
i will give the House a perfect example of a misleading preamble .
we have a lot of work to do as a government to ensure that with the 50:50 split which we talk about going toward tax reduction or toward debt reduction , disadvantaged Canadians benefit at the level they deserve .
of course it will not be the government at that point but when the government members are sitting across here they will say " That was probably the worst mistake we made in this House '' .
become a subsidiary of BCE and donate liberally to the Liberal Party of Canada .
i want to tap into the enormous potential of people who can and want to contribute to our economy and society but who do need some support to do so .
economic growth does not occur in a vacuum .
Mr. Bryon Wilfert :
the Liberal Party director in Quebec knows Mr. Champagne from their fundraising work together and he described him as a good Liberal .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
if he did so he would see very clearly that the history of the Liberal Party has always been one of a trade liberalizing party , a party favouring and wanting to bring down barriers .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
we are taking action on all of the points raised by the panel with regard to the accountability of the Canadian Wheat Board .
the health of the CPP is directly tied to the rate of economic growth and a good level of employment , which increases the government ' s revenues .
the suggestions I am now making had the agreement of the premiers in St. Andrews recently .
the member for Durham was talking about giving money to these programs .
Mr. Speaker , I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand .
this Liberal government however refuses the people that much power .
people see Canada as the country to look at .
some of my patients who go south of the border have to write a cheque for $ 10,000 for health insurance .
it gives the official results .
it really demonstrates the difference between a group of people who have not really thought about what they are proposing and some people who have given a considerable amount of thought to what is actually happening .
Mr. Ren 茅 Canuel
while I am not a constitutional expert , I take that to mean that although the provinces were given exclusive jurisdiction over education , they could not make laws after Confederation which would prejudicially affect any right with respect to denominational schools that a person had by law in the province at the time of union .
teachers
madam Speaker , some things never change in life .
it should also be remembered the the CPP will be reviewed every three years .
in the throne speech the government made one reference to the whole problem of debt .
more recently , a former Liberal provincial minister , Claude Ryan , recognized Quebec ' s special rights .
the legislative report of the Government of Quebec indicates that , in order to protect the rights of linguistic minorities within denominational school boards , the bill would have language councils in each .
last week one of this Parliament ' s greatest family advocates resigned her seat in an effort to keep her family strong .
it is not a provincial issue .
the Speaker :
first , we are working actively to have an international standard through the Oslo convention .
the bad news is , it is a reality .
another astounding fact is that tuition fees in Canada have reached a national average of $ 3,100 which surpasses the average of publicly funded institutions in the United States .
in short , we have consulted broadly with Canadians on the future of the Canadian pension plan and on the need for change .
we will support the motion of the Reform Party , not because we share their philosophy or their approach to improving public finances , but because this motion calls for a debate on the problem as a whole .
organ DONORS
when is the minister going to take the advice of the real job creators and cut taxes ?
we have built that nation and we continue to shape its elements .
we will be going across the country during the next several months asking people to help us bring forward some recommendations for the federal government , to give it a road map so it understands where Canadians are at on these important issues .
given that the Speech from the Throne mentions the unique character alluded to in the Calgary declaration , I would like the hon. member from Newfoundland - and I am sure he knows what happened , he knows the role played by Clyde Wells in the failure of Meech Lake - to tell us whether , in his opinion and the opinion of his party , the expression unique character of Quebec society as used in the meaningless Calgary declaration has the same meaning as the expression distinct society had in the Meech Lake accord .
unlike them , she is very sensitive to the concerns of the unemployed .
Mr. Ted White
of all the promises made by the Liberals during the election campaign , let us hope that those concerning children will be kept , and kept a little better than the motion passed in the House of Commons in 1989 to end child poverty by the year 2000 .

how many kilos of cocaine and pounds of pot were smuggled into Canada because planes from Jamaica went uninspected ?
it is a tremendous amount of money .
my commitment is to the safety of Canadians .
i would point out to my friends across the way that not only have about 25 different countries around the world adopted this sort of plan , countries like the U . K . , Switzerland , Denmark , Australia now has a version of it , and Argentina .
we have an opportunity in the House to debate where we are going in this country based on the mandate we were given in June by Canadians .
Mr. Andr 茅 Harvey
it is our turn to carry on the torch of Stanley Knowles , to carry on his fight for security for seniors , for equality for all people and hope for a better day .
because I do not have a lot of time , I want to talk about the Reform Party proposal .
south Shore families have many farmers , lumbermen and fishers connected with them .
we recognize that there is a Canadian people made up of a great many diverse groups .
the ambassador also referred to U.S. tactics regarding law enforcement in Mexico as hiding a darker U.S. reality .
at the moment , it is going so well in terms of objectives being met and deficit reduction targets surpassed that , if it really wants to fight poverty and underemployment , the federal government should meet our demands .
Mr. Speaker , we have a Canadian , Mr. Ron Reddy who has called us .
we will not do that .
i feel it is time to put a new face on politics .
our plan provides us with the fiscal stability necessary to allow change to be accommodated effectively and efficiently .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
the Deputy Speaker :
we believe in a public pension plan .
it would be easy for us to do just that , shift it on to another administration .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his intervention .
the question was did she think that the taxpayer would be able to spend money more wisely or would a politician or a bureaucrat spend money more wisely .
if in fact it is a reference to the government in terms of drafting bills , yes , it has certain resources .
they have indicated to me that their biggest problem is not having enough money to run their programs .
the Canadian Wheat Board would have the flexibility to purchase grain at a price other than the initial payment .
on the subject of misrepresentation , I would like to focus on two elements of the throne speech : public finances and national unity .
these will include establishing multi - purpose Aboriginal youth centres that will provide targeted social and cultural support in addition to increasing work and learning opportunities for urban Aboriginal youth .
oh , oh .
i believe my fellow Canadians are prepared to look straight ahead .
they have taken the time to organize community based crime prevention initiatives through federal government funding of $ 30 million .
immediately thereafter a representative of each of the recognized parties other than that of the member proposing the motion may be recognized to speak for not more than 10 minutes , following which in each case a period not exceeding 5 minutes shall be available , if required , to allow members to ask questions and comment briefly on matters relevant to the speech and to allow responses thereto .
this shows that its democratic instinct is similar to that of the Reform Party .
as well , from now on whenever provincial governments borrow from the Canada pension plan they will pay the same rate of interest that they pay on their market borrowings .
we must work together so that each and every Canadian can lead a safe and full life .
in his election platform the Prime Minister promised Canadians a 50:50 split between increased spending on one hand and debt and tax reduction on the other .
environment
otherwise , it is always the same baloney .
the Supreme Court and its judges will not change the course of history .
they have proven by their actions that they are unworthy of belonging in our justice system .
if a wheat board manager or a wheat board employee is found to be in civil disobedience or is caught in a criminal act what happens to them ?

i now come to the main point of my comments .
we have seen increases in revenue , in the amount of value that is created from our agricultural community .
Mr. Ken Epp
we have , for example , despite equality a terrible problem of poverty in Canada .
i believe most parties can agree with that .
they have let me know their views on what the government is planning to do .

right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
it still allows for significant investment discretion with respect to allocation .

questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
will the minister make resolving the treaty by January 31 the number one priority of his department ?
i think we shall be able to find a way out , but at what price ?
reform plans to take this away .
the government believes that Canadians should have the broadest range of choice available to them when they decide what is good for them individually .
the government is right in there and that is where the mistrust comes .
i believe that the greatest investment we can make in Canada is in our young people .
will the Solicitor General respond to the request that I made of him at the beginning of September to establish an external inquiry into the volatile situation that prevails in federal detention centres in Quebec ?
the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice .
we know that taxes are too high in this country .
we cannot continue to operate as though we are living in an economic and demographic situation that existed some 30 years ago when the plan was first introduced .

these documents are identical to the budget documents tabled in the House on February 20 , 1997 .
Mr. Speaker , I am sure the hon. member knows that interest rates are at almost a 30 - year low .
when we are sick we feel we can be looked after .
as a result of that , together with the provinces - let me be very clear - the federal government put in place a plan for more funding .
we are not creating a precedent here , and I hope the Leader of the Opposition is going to share our enthusiasm and agree that we are doing the right thing , as parliamentarians , in relying on section 43 of the Constitution Act , 1982 .

Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
i asked some of them to shut up and to help , and we made that change .
none of this government ' s programs could be carried out if our national unity initiatives were not successful .
while the reported crime rate has decreased for four consecutive years , it is still too high .
Mr. Speaker , Fergus , Ontario is located in my riding .
i propose a number of possible solutions to the problems .
some Canadians will be better prepared than others to take advantage of these opportunities , and some Canadians will need help to rise to the challenges .
we have a political process that is still tied to the old slogan of he who pays the piper calls the tune .
let me say very directly to the member opposite that I certainly - and I believe my government - recognize the province of Quebec as a partner within Confederation .
is that the Canadian way ?
his father and his grandfather were lieutenant - governors of Nova Scotia and his grandfather was even a member of Parliament .
nobody expects that solutions will be found overnight .
this is also a country that has done very well in the area of trade .

madam Speaker , on a point of order .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
for those who are in any doubt , from 1994 to 1997 federal cash transfers for health , welfare and post - secondary education dropped from $ 19.3 billion to $ 14.9 billion .
the ultimate goal of the undertakings by Mr. Bouchard and the ministers accompanying him is to make Quebec a focal point of trade exchanges between Europe and the rest of America , and we believe this project has every chance of success .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
hon. Ralph E . Goodale
the circumstances that present themselves to indigenous people are like those that we faced as non - aboriginal Canadians in the fifties and sixties , but the hopes and the dreams that we had in the fifties and sixties are not the hopes and the dreams that aboriginal people have .

instead the government must deal with the additional cost of lost jobs , closed companies and lost tax revenue .
i encourage the hon. member to take part in the public consultation process we are going to go through over the coming months .
throne SPEECH
i do not think there is a single Canadian who would argue against that .
it is important that we stress today very clearly that this amendment would be a bilateral one involving the governments of Canada and Quebec City .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
i have a question for the parliamentary secretary , as she will be the person who will be backing up the justice minister .
if we add the overspending of the provinces to that , in total it overspent maybe $ 1 trillion .
Mr. Paul Forseth

three times in the last Parliament I introduced this legislation and I will continue to do so until the government allows a real free vote on capital punishment where all MPs vote the wishes of their constituents .

Mr. Pierre Brien
there has to be transparency .
no Bloc member could hand me his own list right away .
what greater thing can we do for preserving our health care programs , our pension programs , programs for youth and so on , than by ensuring our economy is strong and vibrant based on a set of books we can all be proud of whether a member of the opposition or not .
more than ever , Canadians want their governments to work together in partnership .
committees should make clear decisions about the circulation of draft reports - .
on this , we will have to wait and see .
it received royal assent on September 20 , 1917 .
could the hon. member for Oxford tell us , as the representative of the views of the people of Oxford , whether his constituents feel that what was offered to Quebec in the Calgary declaration was enough or not ?
we are already going a long way to do what we can .
some people have said this takes away the right to strike and disrupts and interferes with the bargaining process .
who can argue with that ?
if women ' s equality is important would it not be the case that this government would have long ago honoured its obligations under the human rights act to ensure that women in the federal public service were paid on the basis of equality ?
they are using this motion as a pretext to do so .
in other words the federal government could not unilaterally make these changes .

is the hon. member in agreement with this statement by the Reform member ?
second , we are doing no such thing in terms of undermining Canadian sovereignty .

i would ask the member if he is prepared to use that selective approach in deciding which ones he feels should have public involvement and which ones should not .
Mr. Speaker , it is with great pleasure that I rise today to acknowledge two of my constituents from Huron - Bruce .
Ms. Judi Longfield :
the member showed some foresight in dealing with many of the issues at stake .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
we are also talking more insidiously about political parties financed by corporations doing their bidding in the House of Commons on issues that hurt Canadians .
i suppose we are arguing that there is sufficient wealth in this nation to provide for the basics of a family to survive .
our leadership on the elimination of land mines is another example of how Canada is recognized around the world for its compassion and concern for others .
that was the opportunity Canada offered .
hon. Anne McLellan
Canadians should understand the important thing is to determine how we can modify and how we can massage the current Canada pension plan system so that benefits will be there for each and every generation to come on a fair and equitable basis .
government GRANTS
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation .
the bad news is that the Liberal government took one look at the results of the program and did what came naturally .
the present minister of aboriginal affairs has done an exemplary job of working together with aboriginal communities in trying to solve some of the problems .
this augurs well .
i ask the Chair to clarify whether this is a negative motion and technically if it is in order .
i am concerned that they are talking about more government investment .
in concluding , the strategies contained in the Speech from the Throne are basically aimed at restoring the tarnished reputation of this federal government and giving it a semblance of relevance .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
i am sure the members of the government will recognize the strength of tides in the recent election .
through you , we salute their extraordinary work , their courage , their spirit of co - operation , and their readiness to lend a helping hand .
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) :
does he know him or has he ever met him ?
the Speaker :
at the Kiwassa Neighbourhood House the breakfast program for families is a welcoming start to the day .
yes or no ?
as a result of that , New Zealand really has found the optimum size of government and taxation .
i would also like to inform the member that I could not comment on any specific cases .
clearly we point out to the member that his party not that long ago talked about the deficit as the number one issue in this country .
working in close collaboration with industry and a host of government and non - governmental organizations , as well as community and self - help groups , CMHC strives to encourage the -
we have been in our offices from 7.30 a.m. until about 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. every night and he has -
under the department ' s collective agreement with our unions employees are entitled once in their career to apply for unpaid personal needs leave .
did any of the very wealthy pay on that deficit ?
the measure will be debated in the House and I urge Canadians to be alert to these changes .
those amendments would be an excellent opportunity to see a final offer selection arbitration settlement mechanism take place .
i want to point out a fundamental defect in the bill which characterizes most of the legislation brought by the government to the House , that is the absence of an appropriate preamble and a declaration of the intent of the bill .
if we are really going to have credibility we need to have numbers attached to some of these ideas .
i would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the producers of The Sweet Hereafter , Alliance Communications Corporation , and to thank Telefilm Canada for its financial contribution to the film .
this bill makes some important concessions and improvements from its previous incarnation based on amendments proposed by the agriculture committee in the last Parliament .
it is an honourable position , which I am sure you know .
No.
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
the member for Calgary Southwest also criticized the Speech from the Throne because it devolved certain responsibilities that were once federal to the provinces .
would the minister agree it is because of the government ' s mishandling of west coast issues that so many British Columbians do not feel at home in Confederation ?
canada has a moral obligation to deport those who have been found guilty of committing crimes against humanity .
one of my predecessors was the Hon. Jim McGrath , an individual for whom I had a great deal of respect and admiration .
as an Acadian and a New Brunswicker , I am extremely proud of his accomplishments and am confident he will do excellent work as a justice of the Supreme Court of Canada .
is the same thing in all other departments ?
Mr. Speaker , with respect to the new facts you have at your disposal to enlighten your decision , I would like to point out that there used to be a law clerk here , who reported directly to the Speaker of the House .
what we want is a debate about a clear question , not a winning question , but a question that is truthful .
Quebeckers want their politicians to devote themselves to job creation and the economic recovery .
it is nature ' s fault .
the Liberals may need to wake up , and one day I will be asking them to co - operate with me - because I will be introducing a private member ' s bill on money laundering .
it is a matter of urgent public interest .
we will ensure that all Canadians are treated fairly , and I will stand on that record .
Mr. Speaker , does the hon. member really believe that we have tax fairness in this country , that the Conrad Blacks and other wealthy people pay their fair share of taxes ?
miss Deborah Grey
where was the tax increase mentioned in the Liberal red book ?
or does the hon. member concur with the evidence of all of the reputable economists in Canada that this massive tax grab , the largest tax increase in Canadian history , will in fact kill tens of thousands of jobs , taking away the very kind of economic hope that people of my generation so desperately need in order to pay the kind of tax burden that has been levied on us by the fiscal irresponsibility of this and other governments ?
the Government of Canada also has demands , and we are working together , in partnership .
another program called computers for schools redirects surplus computer equipment to schools and public libraries throughout the country .
the government has indeed proceeded with some major changes to our retirement income system , but like most of the things it did in the course of its first mandate , these changes are full of inequity , lack vision and are an unprecedented attack on those people who most deserve help from the government .
we will continue doing so .
i would express to those strong Canadian Wheat Board supporters that they will have to be extremely vigilant in the election process because big money from the merchants of grain with allies like we have just heard from the Reform Party is really out to destroy the Canadian Wheat Board over time .
canada does have problems .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
average Canadians are the real heroes in the war against the deficit .
at the outset I want to thank the government House leader for ensuring that this new legislation , Bill C - 4 , is before the House of Commons at a very early stage in this new Parliament .
political pundits and financial analysts say that Canada is at a critical moment in its financial history .
it is the good and appropriate thing to do .
i find that to be intolerable as well .
because of the way they talk about how they would run the country , not too many corporations would give them money .
we witnessed political interference in the Airbus affair and in the Krever inquiry .
we made frequent reference in the Speech from the Throne to what we intend to do for the children of poor families in Canada .
their message is that we have to be much broader .
the Clerk of the House :
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
it is unprecedented for the House of Commons to have five official parties .
the member ' s contribution to local and national public service is well known , in particular her years as a very progressive mayor of Saint John .
my suspicion is that there is something behind it .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
if need be we must join a crusade to keep this country together .
however , we have come to a point where we are arguing - actually my colleagues opposite are arguing - whether or not this bill embraces democracy .
there were about 69 calls from Canadians .
does he agree with me that there was no mention of the helicopter purchase and could he clarify for the House his party ' s view of the purchase of helicopters ?
it does nothing to address the need for a more equitable redistribution of wealth in the country .
of course , Mulroney continued to spend so there was neither a surplus nor any debt reduction .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅
it is a bill that meets the needs of the wheat industry .
hon. Charles Caccia ( Davenport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
i think that when the member talks about the economy and caring and sharing , about those people who are most in need , as he did in his speech , those are the ones who are looking for work .
it was proud and it was united .
he knows full well that the cuts by this government were nowhere near 40 per cent .
* * *
will the minister do the right thing and reconsider the decision to fob this off to a subcommittee so that the entire finance committee can hold decent hearings across the country on this very important legislation ?
Mr. Speaker , will the minister begin showing compassion by telling the House today what specific measures and time lines the government plans to implement to streamline the appeals process .
it bothers me that in this specific case she used totally incorrect facts without a shred of evidence .
together we progressed from what the international financial community once called a basket case to one of the most robust economies in the industrialized world .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
i would like to ask the member a specific question .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
Mr. Speaker , I rise today in the House on a very important matter to my constituents of Thornhill , and I believe all Canadians , and that is the prosecution of war criminals .
it is ironic that Mr. Crouse did not put much faith in the Liberals ' sincerity on this matter of making education accessible , affordable and excellent .
part of the new optimism is Canadians ' renewed confidence in our capacity as a society to expand opportunity .
our government is committed to working in partnership with aboriginal people , with the first nations , with the Inuit .
let me assure the hon. member that our focus is on getting it right .
i simply cannot , as two of Canada ' s major political parties have proved the contrary .
yes or no .
on behalf of myself and my party , the Bloc Quebecois , I offer my sincere condolences to Mr. MacRae ' s family .
i think we have to say that the DIPP has become tipsy .
the contents of faxed messages between Mr. Amerasinghe , Mr. John Sims and the deputy attorney general clearly reveal that these officials were aware of this issue or problem days before the letters were sent to defence counsel and is a direct contradiction to what the former justice minister stated in this House .
the plan provides retirement pensions and a range of survivor benefits for a family in the event of death .
j . Chester MacRae continued his interest in the military after the war and throughout his life with his final appointment being honorary Colonel of the First Battalion , the Royal New Brunswick Regiment ( Carleton and York ) .
i would appreciate if you would equally give consideration to that word in your research of precedents .
it is about time Reformers were called to task for their hypocrisy , called to task for breaking promises , called to task for misleading the farmers of this country .
what is being proposed in the RRSP scenario is that those who have a lot of money to pay into RRSPs will be the benefactors of a pension in the future .
the return on its investments in Quebec businesses has reached the astonishing level of 41.2 percent , thus adding to the assets of its contributors .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
as it stands now crown corporations such as Canada Post , the CBC and the Canadian Wheat Board are exempt from access to information even though they are subsidized by our tax dollars .
what if our constituents want us to make what goes on in the Senate the business of the House ?
as a secondary effect of these CPP taxes , what does the hon. member feel the impact will be on small business ?
Mr. Speaker , this is getting annoying .
he disagrees with what the member for Sherbrooke says but I do not think the hon. member for Sherbrooke , as he is alleging , has violated the rules of parliamentary debate .
i do know that as we speak the government is in discussions with the merchant marine veterans .
i would submit that this is an opportunity for the government to show and put meaning to the words in the throne speech , to work realistically in partnership with the First Nations , to resolve this outstanding land claim rather than force this First Nations group to go through a lengthy court action .
they are prepared to pay a lesser premium to the MP pension fund to get millions of dollars in unfunded , lifetime pension benefits .
there is a proverb that says that where there is no vision , the people perish , but he that keepeth the law , happy is he .
hon. David M Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
that is one of the reasons the fund is in trouble .
however , if we look at the history of Canada , although people say there were two founding peoples , the francophones were here first , 150 years before the new bosses of my hon. friend opposite .
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
the prime minister made a pledge to municipalities and municipalities want him to make good on that pledge in this Parliament .
however , these increased contributions would be offset by the substantial reductions of personal income tax rates and EI premiums .
in doing so I have two purposes .
i asked the question in the House today yes or no , is the employment insurance fund of the government being used to reduce the deficit .
i would like to ask a question to our new colleague , a question that comes from the conclusions of the previous speaker , who said that Quebec did not have the monopoly on French culture in Canada since there are francophones outside Quebec .
Mr. Gilbert Normand :
let me use a practical example .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
we want to examine the dry bones .
there is no help at all .
Mr. Speaker , to begin with I would like to advise you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Guelph - Wellington .
under the guise of an economic mission , he is promoting Canada ' s partition .
Mr. Speaker , the Deputy Prime Minister would have us believe that the Minister of Human Resources Development is to be congratulated for taking the initiative of calling the RCMP .
i have had single mothers around me crying because they just do not work .
this is pap .
the issue here - and it is something successive Liberal and Tory governments have missed for a long , long time - is that money belongs to Canadian taxpayers .
can the public works minister give us the assurance , beyond all doubt , that he has taken every measure possible to prevent all influence peddling in the award of government contracts ?
those are two examples but there are more .
i would ask the hon. member to comment on the area of victims rights .
we were doing just fine .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano
Mr. Maurice Godin
* * *
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present the first report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs regarding membership and the associate membership of the standing committees of the House .
that notion is completely out of sync with the reality in the country .
Mr. Werner Schmidt
Mr. Jerry Pickard
it is one of the biggest tax attacks we have witnessed in the history of the country .
Ms. Aileen Carroll
when people change their economic behaviour and hide retirement income , it simply increases the load on government with more demand for social programs .
i submit this is a better , broader and a more far sighted framework for pension reform than anything we heard this morning .
goods and Services Tax
we have made clear that our government will reduce taxes when it is affordable , when a fiscal surplus is certain and secure , because we will never jeopardize the progress that we have made on the deficit .
none are working there now .
there is no question we all want to get to the bottom of this , that due process has to kick in and that we need time for the RCMP to complete its investigation .
will the justice minister move immediately to establish an independent and open appointment process to restore Canadians ' faith in our court system ?
this is common sense yet it escapes the thinking of the government .
i am convinced that , in the days or weeks to come , we will learn that the whole cabinet knew , except of course the Solicitor General who , I am sure , was not aware of the case .
introduction and first reading
the Deputy Speaker :
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
( motion agreed to )
the Bloc Quebecois cannot support this part of the CPP reform .
everywhere I went during the June election I was told that the pain had been real but worthwhile since the strategy of achieving a balanced budget had been successful .
agreed .
the number one objective in notes of the Quebec minister was to promote the integration of immigrants into the francophone community .
in hindsight everybody would like to have seen a different decision given the benefit of the information that the minister has .
if we look at -
Mr. Speaker , it is quite straightforward that I represent my constituents .
that is not what he said .
the Reform Party plan would deliver about $ 1 billion in tax relief to Atlantic Canada .
as I mentioned earlier to the House in response to another question , with each agreement we negotiate the transfer for the purpose of self - government , a program for health of aboriginal communities .
Mr. Minister -
my colleagues , I want to thank you very much for last week .
any member of the House who has RRSPs in a mutual fund company will know that they have grown a lot more than the CPP in the last few years .
let me quote from the September 16 , 1997 edition of the Toronto Star and an article written about the technology triangle which includes Guelph - Wellington .
does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion ?
can the minister confirm that there are guidelines restricting the hours of operation at Lester B . Pearson International Airport and can the minister assure the citizens of Mississauga that the government will not allow the Greater Toronto Airport Authority to unilaterally change those hours ?
this strategy by the government and the management at Canada Post makes a mockery of the collective bargaining process .
it allows the income to be split .
then he mentioned parallel examples of other individuals who committed heinous crimes while they were already before the justice system on other matters .
national UNITY
approximately 12,000 Quebeckers are affected by the plan .
i am really pleased to do that .
the investment is to be managed by a new independent board at arm ' s length from the government .
this government says it wants to support Canadian culture .
the various levels of government are also capable of reaching agreement when they are motivated by a clear desire to succeed .
Mr. Speaker , if I may , I would like to congratulate my colleague on his speech .
Mr. Jay Hill
hon. Anne McLellan
hon. David M. Collenette ( Don Valley East , Lib . ) :
we are also concerned that some of the original recommendations for safety were not followed .
as a traditional measure provinces will have the option of rolling over their existing borrowing at maturity , at market rates , for almost 20 years .
while the residents of Whitby - Ajax elected me on June 2 , they also gave a substantial vote of confidence to the government and its unequalled record of sound fiscal management .
that was done in good and proper form at a meeting at which Your Honour was present .
i believe those organizations already rely largely on the support of Canada , in particular the Department of Human Resources Development .
those who would try to keep the Bloc Quebecois and its spokespersons from speaking to foreign officials in Ottawa and around the world about the political project of the Quebec government , a project shared by both the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois , will not succeed in preventing us from doing so .
that is what the people are saying about this charade that we saw taking place today .
first of all , because the anglophone minority is part of our history .
Mr. Maurice Dumas
hear , hear .
it is indeed his first question .
currently we are engaged in negotiations to set rules and regulate the investment portfolio because today there are over 1,300 different bilateral investment agreements .
the sugar plums that dance in her head are coated with taxpayers ' dollars .
when I see members opposite continually cry murder , I feel sorry for them , Madam Speaker .
a Canadian passport is too important to be muddied doing the dirty work in undercover operations .
we are saying to the House of Commons and to the people of Canada that the system we have now which provides financing to political parties has to be revisited .
we have actually seen increases in our export capability in this field .
nationally there is a strong and growing commitment among police and law enforcement agencies in all jurisdictions to work with my ministry and the Department of Justice to build stronger partnerships to combat organized crime .
i draw the attention of the hon. member to the actuarial report that basically stated that this surplus is required in case of an economic downturn to offset any of the strain that that may place on the federal treasury .
the west is ready to bring those ideas and energies to the national scene , not simply to advance its interests , not to protect its interests , but to make a contribution to the new Canada .
that is what it will mean to the anglophone community .
he also talked about people having much less disposable income and not having as much money to spend in their communities .
on quality health care , the Speech from the Throne talks about the importance of health care in our society .
that should be of concern to us as parliamentarians as well .
i would like to know whether the President of Treasury Board , as the minister responsible for the Quebec region , receives such lists from other ministers .
but we made the right decisions and now the deficit has almost been eliminated .
the riding is as economically diverse as the people in it .
i quote :
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) moved :
the initiatives will help decrease incarceration rates and render our streets safer .
Mr. Speaker , when it comes to the recommendations , it has taken this minister a long time to get down to the basics .
the private plan Reformers are proposing does not have the features of a public pension plan .
trust me , when it gets to committee I am sure there will be plenty of time to debate these very , very positive and constructive criticisms of this bill .
what has not changed is the docility of the Liberal backbenchers , who rise and applaud their Minister of Finance and their Prime Minister day after day .
this can happen in an unending cycle .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi
* * *
i want to clarify a few of the facts about the Canada pension plan system .
together we are now building the comprehensive and effective National Child Benefit System .
the age of retirement , early , normal or late , will remain unchanged .
appendix
this not only brings into question the internal workings of the Senate , but obviously senators cannot or refuse to police themselves .
what direction does the minister intend to give the national AIDS strategy and is he considering the possibility of resorting to joint licensing by the United States and Canada to accelerate the process ?
it is incumbent on us to continue to assist people caught in this way with retraining or appropriate early retirement programs .
again a number of steps would have to take place .
he is advocating one system of medical care for the rich and one for the rest of us .
he simply stood up and said " my generation now , at our age , doesn ' t think this is a good deal for us , so forget the older generation Canadians '' .
obviously , we always tried to select the best , but the best is usually an acquaintance or a friend , someone who has done us a favour in the past .
members
our campaign platform was clear with respect to sound management of public finances , as well as the battle against poverty .
where is representation by population in this House ?
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
( l ) Justice and Human Rights ( sixteen Members ) ;
job CREATION
in any event , the government acted through the Minister of Human Resources Development quickly , responsibly and with integrity by immediately bringing the allegations in question to the RCMP when they reached his attention .
this mine will , therefore , be a source of ongoing employment for my constituents of Acadie - Bathurst for the next eight years .
Mr. Michel Gauthier
they are co - operating with us in our investigation and have agreed to establish a process which will result in the kind of agreement that will never see it happen again .
education is the key to success and we will work hard on post - secondary education to reduce barriers for so many of them with further changes to the Canada student loans program with increased assistance for students with dependants and new scholarships such as the Canada millennium scholarship endowment fund as announced by the prime minister .
i want to start my comments to this House by assuring all seniors in Canada who are currently receiving benefits under the CPP system , whether they are survivor benefits or disability benefits or whether they have reached retirement age and are collecting benefits , that under the proposals before the House those benefits will remain unchanged .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to respond to the member by saying that since the last time he was a member in the House of Commons things have changed a fair amount .
on the surface the motion is relatively straightforward .
i encourage all my fellow members to support it .
it is a peacemaker and a leader .
Ms. Claudette Bradshaw
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
hon. Allan Rock
multilateral AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT
Mr. John Herron
this represents a slight reduction for new recipients , because the average over five years , generally speaking , will be slightly less than that calculated over three years .
i expect my colleagues from the Reform Party to agree with this statement as it is written in the conference room at their party ' s headquarters in Calgary .
* * *
when was this government planning to get around to telling the Canadian people that they are now on a 21 - day countdown for a national postal strike ?
my colleagues , you will note that Mr. Atom Egoyan is here with us today .
Mr. Speaker , the time has finally come to reply to the federalist demagogues who keep telling anyone who will listen that the political climate in Quebec has investors fleeing .
they have our sympathy and our deepest respect for the sacrifices they were willing to make so that he could do his work in the House .
Mr. Chuck Strahl
Mr. Speaker , someone has gone to get the document in question .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the minister for her very impassioned comments .
i am surprised , moreover , to see how the Liberal government is copying from Quebec : partnership , drug insurance , youth employment strategy - copied from Carrefour Jeunesse - Emploi .
is this government expecting a recession ?
Mr. Tony Valeri
for example , the skilled trades should be valued for the contribution they make to a vibrant economy .
the Government will continue to reduce barriers to post - secondary education through further changes to the Canada Student Loans Program , increased assistance for students with dependents , and new scholarships to encourage excellence and to help low - and moderate - income Canadians attend university or college .
why can the elected directors elect the president of the board but not the president of the commission ?
agreed .
as the throne speech stated , we would all be forever diminished , forever changed , should we fail to maintain the example Canada provides to the world .
in addition , by changing the eligibility requirements for employment insurance , the federal government is forcing unfortunate unemployed workers onto welfare , with no regard for how terribly traumatizing this can be .
that is twice as much .
Mr. Speaker , in fact -
in this throne speech , the government is trying to look generous , but it is in fact interfering in three areas of provincial jurisdiction : health , universities and social programs .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for Stoney Creek for his comment and question .
member FOR RIMOUSKI - MITIS
* * *
Mr. Speaker , I have a petition signed by over 2,000 citizens from Thunder Bay , Kenora , Keewatin , Kakabeka Falls , South Gillies , Nolalu , Kaministikwia , Redditt , Manitouwadge and Dryden .
the hon. member talks about the medical care system and how he would like to see jobs created in medical care .
we want to make sure that this dirt comes to the surface in order to find out what the answers are .
all these things would create jobs in this country and would help to get a more buoyant economy .
Mr. Jason Kenney
unemployment for young people in this country is still too high .
for the very first time since the 1970 s , we see Thornhill put back together again .
nonetheless , there is an increasing anxiety among Canadians about the present state and the future of our medicare system .
it is sad but true that in a country that supports multiculturalism and has two official languages , one has been ignored and given no consideration whatsoever .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
that is one of the reasons we still have over 9 % unemployment , 1.4 million unemployed Canadians , and 17 % youth unemployment .
the government has also offered $ 1.3 billion to the unions that represent the women involved in order to give justice and pay equity in the country .
it says :
tourism
ten years ago Canada began an international immunization program and immunized hundreds of thousands of children in 25 countries against six fatal diseases .
* * *
so do Canadians as a whole .
Mr. Werner Schmidt
Quebeckers can see through all that .
if the NDP wants to destroy the Canada pension plan , why is it not being honest about it ?
as I campaigned this spring one pressing concern was the preservation and acceptability of health care .
premium increases place greater burden on the working poor than on wealthy Canadians .
it is available from the justice department . Amazing .
let us not have any further delay .
many people will say that for every billion dollars of direct foreign investment in Canada 45,000 new jobs are created .

oral QUESTION PERIOD
Mr. Paul Szabo
as far as the eye can see is pork when they talk about that kind of investment board .
everyone present at such meetings , including officials from departments and agencies , must realize their obligation to respect the confidentiality of the proceedings they witness and the material they may therefore be privy to .
it will not be there to circulate time and again between businesses and so on .
i will permit the hon. Minister of Transport to reply the preamble .
already we know that if people rely on the Canada pension plan and old age security as their sole income in their retirement years , that is a very modest income .
in the last meeting of the premiers I took considerable hope in the fact that all premiers but one was prepared to begin to bring down those barriers .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister again .
this is not something my party thought would be fun to investigate .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy :
it may be a small step , but a step in the right direction nonetheless in modernizing the Canadian Wheat Board .
i think the hon. member has expressed his view about what the extension should have been but in the circumstances , I recognize the hon. member for Sherbrooke .
hon. David M. Collenette
if as anticipated the prime minister announces a legally binding emissions cap in Kyoto , Japan in December of this year , the announcement will effectively kill the goodwill built between government and industry and will result in a loss of jobs as well as government wealth generated through taxation and royalty revenues .
Mr. John Reynolds
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
it is not done behind closed doors by politicians , and I think that is a desirable way to adjudicate these issues .
a safe society depends on strong crime prevention efforts as well as traditional legal responses .
the eastern townships was a test case and it worked out quite well .
do not get me wrong , British Columbians love Canada and will do everything in their power to have it remain united .
Canadians have begun to dream again , and this Parliament ' s challenge is to live up to the spirit of those dreams .
supply
does the member recognize the existence of the people of Quebec , and if so , is she going to support and vote in favour of the amendment presented by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois ?
the Liberal candidate was personally endorsed by the prime minister and he launched into a litany of vicious personal attacks , innuendoes and mud slinging which detracted completely from the issues .
he did ask if a number of our members were prepared to debate further , but there was no consideration given to the fact that there was going to be further debate .
this Reform Party position leads me to the position of the government , which is trying to worm out of it by shifting the administration of a government plan to a local administration .
Mr. Speaker , I have a petition from 200 residents of the Peterborough area who are concerned about the transfer of women to the men ' s penitentiary in Kingston .
Mr. Speaker , I reiterate that we have not paid off the deficit because that is a physical impossibility .
edited HANSARD * NUMBER 12
i am convinced that when things are clear , Quebecers and other Canadians will choose to stay together because it is the best choice for them and their children .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
i have already explained that we are going to appoint an arm ' s length science advisory board to get independent assessment .

Yvon Cyrenne , one of the Le Hir report authors , gave $ 900 to the PQ in 1994 . Yvon Martineau , who became CEO of Hydro - Qu 茅 bec , contributed $ 1,000 to the PQ fund the year before his appointment .

they some how manage to portray the needs of the economy above the needs of people .
the debt has been increasing .
after ten years of militant action in favour of sovereignty , I finally have a chance to pursue my action as an elected representative .
those who spend years teaching others to keep clean cannot take any risk when it comes to cleaning up their own house .
that is why the formation of the $ 800 million Canada Foundation for Innovation that our government established in the last budget is so important .
instead of being lent in their entirety to the provinces we are now in the position with the passing of the legislation to make the investment philosophy of the Canada pension plan more market oriented .
it was the defence department and the Canadian government .
the institute went on to say that subsidies handed out under the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency provided disincentives to work and promoted the expansion of inefficient companies .
every time the Liberals in opposition would rise in a howl about the increase in payroll tax .
another interesting question :
auditor GENERAL
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
there are 301 members in this House most of whom may wish to have bills drafted , but there are only two legislative counsel on staff plus one on contract to do all the necessary drafting .
this shows that we do have a departmental war crimes section , where an inventory of about 300 suspected people was made , and I emphasize the word " suspected '' .
Mr. Mark Muise :
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
Friday night I was back in with my daughter .
the real country with which we compare is to the south of us .
i am very proud of this program .
they are not a tax .
we represent many families , many women in this country trying to juggle so much because of the inaction and the lack of attention of this government to those very important issues .
sometimes it is the deform party .
my remarks today will focus on a very important element of the legislation at hand , a new investment for the Canada pension plan .
Pierre Trudeau , who was leader of the opposition on October 9 , 1979 , a couple of weeks after Mr. Fraser retired as Clerk said this about him :
in that division a number of Reform members voted for the bill : the hon. member for St. Albert , the hon. member for Kootenay - Columbia , the hon. member for Calgary - Nose Hill , the hon. member for Macleod , the hon. member for Cariboo - Chilcotin and a number of others .
the second thrust is to maximize the rate of return through the establishment of a Canada pension plan investment board . >
i see that the member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot is saying that , yes , that is precisely what they want .
clearly the federal government has the authority to make the change .
the government has committed itself to expand these programs .
is the House ready for the question ?
we indeed have accomplishments in Canada .
she spoke with such tremendous conviction that I was absolutely astounded .
Mr. Ken Epp :
if that were the case , should I judge on the quality of all questions in the House ?
Mr. Ted White
the Reform Party and lobby groups , such as the Business Council on National Issues , are pressuring the government to give further tax breaks to Canada ' s highest income earners and the most successful corporations .
reform ' s retirement plan would guarantee that contributions are for pensions and , more important , Reform ' s plan would ensure considerably higher pensions for Canadians .
we said very clearly we will spend more money when we are in a surplus position .
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan :
now that we ' re coming into economic hard times , the sense of each man for himself , save your own skin , get whatever advantage you can is going to sink public spiritedness and make it much more difficult to preserve our sense of obligation to the community .
in my opinion the nays have it .
Mr. Derek Lee ( Scarborough - Rouge River , Lib . ) :
Ms. Alexa McDonough
it is often said that a real measure of a government should be how it deals with its poor , its elderly and its sick .
helicopters will probably be a lot more important than helping poor children .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
to enhance the Canadian Wheat Board ' s flexibility , to give farmers more choice in how they are paid for their grain and to speed up cash flows to producers , Bill C - 4 will enable the Canadian Wheat Board to make cash purchases of wheat and / or barley , increase initial payments quickly whenever market conditions warrant , close and pay out pool accounts at any time , provide an early pool cash - out option , fully use modern risk management tools , issue negotiable producer certificates , offset storage costs , facilitate deliveries to condo storage systems and receive grain through on - farm mobile elevators .
* * *
these are the people who paid the price for the fact that the Liberal majority did not listen to the public consultations that were held across Canada .
how did we ever get to this point ?
Mr. Speaker , Lucien Bouchard uses Quebeckers ' priorities in a shameless manner , in order to further his own interests , his partitionist interests .
in the Senate there are 104 senators .

the provision for marketing plans is in the current act but it has never been used .
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) :
we do not have figures for poverty for the Canadian population in general or of child poverty or for other categories , but for seniors that has been a remarkable accomplishment over the last 30 years .

it puts all the risks on the worker .
we will look at ideas that come from all quarters .
Mr. Speaker , the Canada Council gives grants to people to do some very useful work .
Claude Ryan never agreed to sign it either .
i tell you , they should go up in our caucus room because you are right .
while I support the removal of conditional sentencing for violent offenders , I think it certainly has merit .
the illustrations show that voluntary action can be very helpful .
i am honoured to be able to do that .
Mr. Speaker , it is ironic that the hon. member for Medicine Hat is asking the House to condemn the government for an election promise when that is what it was and indeed the people of Canada saw fit to elect the government on that basis .
the Speaker :
* * *
Mr. Speaker , Canadians are getting very concerned that all we hear from the government is concern but nothing in the way of solid , detailed plans .
for the simple reason that the Bloc Quebecois is on the side of jobs and job creation .
we have the HST instead .
the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the Constitution Act of 1982 applies .

Mr. Speaker , I would like to inform the House that I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Simcoe - Grey .
it is important to note , however , that the amendments do not constitute the full response of the Government of Canada to the concerns of the Canadian grain producers and the recommendations of the western grain panel .
when we came to Ottawa , we knew it would be hard , that harsh words would be exchanged .
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration .
as you may recall , we released two papers : one on corporate tax reform and the other on personal income tax reform .
i believe it is not the fault of the transfer payment cuts which I think were very necessary in order to be able to reduce the interest payments and for us to continue to do good work .
this is a parliament with a unique and historic opportunity to provide leadership on national issues to secure the social and economic future of Canadians as we approach the next millennium .
i want to thank the constituents of Simcoe - Grey .
hon. Allan Rock
i would like to ask this member if he believes that the Canadian people are demanding higher and higher taxes for the level of service they are receiving which is putting them in such jeopardy in their established day to day lives .
what specific steps will the minister take to address the accountability recommendations outlined in the Somalia report so the public can see what is going on in that department ?
as you know , I am a young person .
when the House last considered the matter , the hon. member for Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke had the floor .
those members say this is an Ottawa made bill for the bureaucracy that basically is in Ottawa , and therefore the bill is going to stay here .
i draw the attention of the Speaker to the October 17 , 1995 Journals at page 2022 .
it has not been discussed .
we must counter misguided passion with focused conviction .

Mr. Lee Morrison
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased the government will further strengthen and improve the Young Offenders Act .
i am sure you will do fine work on behalf of all of us in the House .
the optimal size of government , the optimal level of taxes and the optimal level of debt are extraordinarily important issues .
why the government is blind to it we cannot understand .
it will expand our Aboriginal Head Start program onto reserves to ensure that all Aboriginal children have the opportunity to get a good start in life .
over the course of this Parliament it is my intention to devote myself to providing the people of Nepean - Carleton with the best possible representation .
i say to the government , do not just tell us , show us .
our government has a strong commitment to endangered species and is in fact making progress .
despite the fact that some of my colleagues started calling me the half - whip , I consider it to be an honour to serve in those two capacities .
introduction and first reading
the work of the royal commission can serve to guide us as we flesh out and build a new framework for the relationship .
RALPH CAMPBELL
the emphasis on exports as a source of one in three Canadian jobs bodes well for residents in my riding .
third , Canadians desire real leadership .
also , they neglect to mention that the government has grabbed the surpluses in the unemployment insurance fund , to which it stopped contributing several years ago .
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay :
i did not know Mr. MacRae personally , but everyone I talked to described him as a devoted individual and member of the Conservative Party for 15 years , and especially as a devoted officer in the Canadian army .
what are the things that they absolutely have to have or there will be no deal in Paris ?
need I remind the House that health care management is the responsibility of each province .
i am certainly enjoying being a Reform member of Parliament .
there were many good points brought up by that commission .
comments DURING QUESTION PERIOD
in a second memo dated May 12 , 1996 Mr. Amerasinghe states :
i have already done that and over 80 % of the farmers want changes to the wheat board , which the minister is not making .
final OFFER ARBITRATION IN RESPECT OF WEST COAST PORTS OPERATIONS ACT
sometimes they get confused about how it relates to employment insurance , old age security , the GIS , RRSPs , RIFs and all of the other financial instruments that seem to be part of our daily dialogue in this House .
i commit to them that I will take full advantage of this opportunity to voice their feelings .
Mr. Preston Manning
we have talked about a number of different tax reforms in our document .
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) :
does the government honestly believe foreign investors will come to Canada to have their pockets picked ?
Mr. David Iftody ( Provencher , Lib . ) :
i must point out to you that the commission has recommended neither that only individuals be allowed to make contributions nor that a maximum be established for contributions .
my office has been deluged with calls from people who want to know what this will mean .
i do not think , frankly , that there is enough money to go around .
has the clerk of the privy council been formally advised of this investigation by the RCMP ?
i hope they were not involved , but it is up to them to provide answers .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Minister of Public Works and Government Services told us that the government has a new system for choosing the successful bidders on larger contracts , but there are Liberal Party organizers and campaign workers on this committee and they give government contracts to Liberal firms .
canada is the best place in the world to live .
certainly the government would prefer not to talk about it as a tax .
the bill is now at second reading , the stage at which we deal with the underlying principles of the legislation .
Mr. Speaker , when we said we want to work in partnership and in collaboration with the provinces it is because we believe in equality .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom :
i call for a quorum count .
if CPP is to be there for the upcoming generation we have to make changes to it right now so that they can survive .
order IN COUNCIL APPOINTMENTS
in the last four years the people of Dartmouth have been beaten up by the heavy handed cuts to the civil service in this country .
that is a bit of education for some people who do not understand it .
Tuesday , October 7 , 1997
strengthen the capacity for good government in Aboriginal communities .
we shared with all Canadians the goods we had in the dark days of the Great Depression .
we also know that the Prime Minister enjoys a good golf game .
trade and investment are simply not a matter of crunching numbers or posting figures .
we have tried to make those changes as easy and spread over a longer period of time as possible .
i hope her involvement will go beyond wagging her finger in this House .
i would also like to extend congratulations to those who assist you in your job .
Mr. Speaker , when pressed just now , the solicitor general told us that he knew that people in cabinet , people around him , the RCMP , were aware of the serious allegations against a Liberal party organizer .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
we agreed to write a treaty .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
Mr. Speaker , I would advise the hon. member that I have been briefed on this matter for fully a week .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
if I asked for the floor in this venerable House today , it is to talk about the priorities of our government .
however , I am sure that there is a plausible explanation .
i have worked long and hard as the trade critic for our party to try to resolve the European ban on leg - hold traps and products from those traps from entering Europe .
Mr. Jerry Pickard ( Kent - Essex , Lib . ) :
will the Prime Minister or the government tell us what their plan is to address this injustice to thousands of disabled Canadians who are waiting for an answer on this very critical issue ?
there were a couple of particularly strong ones over his commitment to workfare , which I think has been proven to be something of a failure , and also over his commitment to court corporations into the province to create low wage jobs as long as they were subsidized by the public .
CANADIAN ECONOMY
Mr. Gerry Byrne
Monday , September 22 , 1997
i said we are going to create urban and multipurpose aboriginal youth centres to help them provide that cultural and supportive environment , to encourage them to stay in school in order to complete their education .
there was only one mention of tax decreases and debt reduction while we are sitting in the midst of an economic crisis in the country .
* * *
it is very important for us to share in the great benefits the economy of this nation has .
members I am sure will be familiar with the document .
since the political discussions on unity have essentially focussed on the decentralization of powers and the subsequently greater provincial autonomy , the question of minority rights becomes all the more important .
he was educated at public schools and Scott Collegiate in Regina , moving on to teachers college .
next , the surpluses must be used in the fight against poverty .
such was the purpose of the GST .
* * *
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
the government ' s commitment to youth goes back to our days in opposition .
Canadians from coast to coast to coast have worked hard , made tough decisions and sacrificed much , and now we are seeing the results .
the idea of the 10 minute question and answer period is that there be an opportunity for a number of members to rise .
madam Speaker , I am pleased to stand in the chamber today as the new member of Parliament for St. John ' s East .
when the Assembl 茅 e des 茅 v 锚 ques makes a pronouncement on an issue , it usually does so solemnly .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
of all the motions he could have selected , of every single possibility , to show that they were indeed a responsible opposition , an opposition that saw the whole country , an opposition that was not prepared to play petty little politics at the beginning of the parliamentary session , of all the possibilities , he picked this one .
these kinds of stories are shocking and alarming .
i am certain that the people of British Columbia , as well as members of the official opposition , will want to make certain that Quebecers know the consequences of what a vote for separation will mean .
Shana Tova .
the hon. member agreed to leave the meeting to allow a discussion of financial issues with the members of the Stony tribe .
i wonder what he will bring to the Reform Party in terms of integrity , in terms of fundraising , in terms of cleaning up the system which exists now , which quite frankly is not in tune with contemporary politics and contemporary thinking in society .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
i would like to say that my constituents were very disappointed when there was no mention of their issues and concerns in last week ' s throne speech .
job CREATION
the government believes that through small and medium size businesses we can develop and improve new technologies .
as he admits , in his area of St. John ' s the people spoke out overwhelmingly against Meech Lake and I presume the Charlottetown accord as they did in my region of Ontario .
it also provides for an increase in the maximum penalty for forcible confinement from 10 to 14 years in the case of a parent or ward who confines a child and thereby harms the child ' s physical or mental health .
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
this is absolute pap .
and more than five members having risen :
he said that we were talking nonsense , that we did not know how to count , that what we thought did not matter .
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton
borrowing from the ideas generated at the landmark National Forum on Breast Cancer in November 1993 , federal leadership mobilized concerted country wide efforts around breast cancer through five linked components : the Canadian breast cancer research initiative ; and the Canadian breast cancer screening initiative ; clinical practice guidelines ; the professional education strategy ; and five breast cancer information exchange pilot projects .
Mr. Bill Blaikie
our geography comes immediately to mind , a huge land mass and one of the longest coastlines in the world .
the repayment of the debt should be debated .
some hon. members :
i am the MP for that riding .
they do represent really the vanguard of the future and we welcome them to this House .
the amendment is in order .
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 8 , an act respecting an accord between the Governments of Canada and the Yukon Territory relating to the administration and control of and legislative jurisdiction in respect of oil and gas .
standing Committee on Industry
the Reform Party always boasts about how democratic it is , about how it believes in referenda and plebiscites as a means of making political decisions .
Mr. Ghislain Lebel
SchoolNet , which Microsoft ' s Bill Gates said was " the leading program in the world in terms of getting kids to use computers '' , will have every school and library in Canada connected by 1998 .
Mr. Speaker , congratulations on your appointment .
we have the accumulated debt to pay in the future .
in a nutshell , that is what Bill C - 4 is all about , empowering producers , enshrining democratic authority which has never existed before , providing new accountability , new flexibility and responsiveness , and positioning farmers to shape the kind of wheat board they want for the future .
permit me to quote briefly a favourite passage : " There is nothing so congenial to lucid thought as a clear view of the sea .
did the government not feel any twinge of conscience in seeing those people watch Clifford Olson parade passed the cameras on his way to a parole hearing ?
it is the politics of Ross Perot .
hon. David M. Collenette
Mr. Speaker , I want to thank the hon. member for her comments .
will the minister confirm to this House that one or several employees in his Montreal office conveyed to or shared with Pierre Gobeil , who is currently under investigation , or other members , confidential government information for financing purposes ?
is this a coincidence ?
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
again , these questions must be addressed by the committee .
i feel like apologizing to them on behalf of at least part of this Parliament for our inability to prevent them from suffering the pain that they did .
tourism is another precious commodity in Sault Ste. Marie .
miss Deborah Grey
second there are also some welcomed changes in governance .
perhaps he is not speaking for his party .
this is an invitation .
after careful consideration the Chair concludes that the application does not meet the terms of the standing order .
for instance in the last Parliament they allowed the former deputy prime minister to go on periodic spending sprees whenever she got the desire to be patriotic .
they need to be able to dream and to reach for the stars .
that will make a very major dent into the employment situation in that community .
i do not agree with the member from British Columbia who spoke a few minutes ago .
we should be doing all that we can to attract the best and the brightest of graduate studies in science and engineering , because the future prosperity and well - being of Canadians will depend to a very large extent on their efforts .
my late father was wounded on those beaches in Normandy .
after I have studied it to my satisfaction , I will come back to the House with a decision on this matter .
this would not unduly delay anything , given the fact that the parliamentary committee on procedure , privilege and elections has barely been constituted for 24 hours .
my dear colleagues , thank you again for the honour that you have bestowed on me today .
Mr. Speaker , I begin by congratulating the hon. member for Charlesbourg on his first speech in the House of Commons .
she cannot manufacture culture .
human RIGHTS
the hon. member for Gatineau .
Mr. Speaker , the member for Skeena brought up the name of the Kwanlin Dun band in referring to having misappropriated funds or in terms that were quite derogatory to the band .
pensions
one in every three Canadian jobs now depends on trade .
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , NDP ) :
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
it is public information , my friends .
the other half will go to a combination of tax reductions and debt repayment .
Solberg ( Medicine Hat ) moved that this House condemn the government for making their 50 / 50 election promise on any future surpluses without adequate public debate as to the optimal size of government , taxes and debt , thus threatening to repeat Canada ' s 27 year old history of irresponsible spending , creating high debt , financed by high taxes , causing high unemployment .
when we start looking at it that way some surprising things turn up .
in 1993 the poverty rate for seniors increased over the previous year in almost every province .
we intend to provide annual statements to all contributors as soon as it is feasible .
we will continue to enforce the principles of the Canada Health Act , not out of devotion to stale ideology or some dated catechism but because the Canada Health Act and the public system of health insurance which it provides remains the best approach to health care for Canadians .
this is why Canadians are disappointed .
it is signed by the Minister of Finance .
but if this government understands what true partnership means , what is it waiting for to form a partnership in the area of health , to co - manage our federation ?
was government information used for the purposes of a political party ' s fundraising activities ?
the second reason for stating our intent is much more profound and down to earth .
according to a Department of Finance study acquired through an access to information request , the increase in compulsory contributions from 3.6 % to 5 % that happened between 1986 and 1993 reduced employment by nearly 26,000 jobs .
hon. Andy Scott
in the past , discussions that centred on the unique character of Quebec have been met with suspicion in British Columbia and other parts of the country .
i would also like to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on your recent appointment as Deputy Speaker of this assembly .
the hon. member for Calgary Northeast .
the legal profession disparagingly refers to preambles in legislation as the pious hope clause .
that is the way to handle this , in other words , inform the police and let them do their job .
it may come as a surprise but this hon. member either would not or could not carry through on his promise .
one of them at least the Prime Minister and I would agree on .
Mr. Speaker , we have been unable to reach an agreement pursuant to Standing Order 78 ( 1 ) or 78 ( 2 ) with respect to proceedings at the second reading stage of Bill C - 2 , an act to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to amend the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts .
this country has been built on the philosophy of sharing of responsibilities for one another , where we contribute .
this defence of provocation blames Susan for her own death .
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
boring .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
he reflects precisely my point of view , that indeed we , as members of Parliament , have a role to play in building with First Nations the strategies for the future .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
the same is true for child poverty or youth policy .
that is also why we have lowered employment insurance contributions in each of our four budgets , and that is why we have introduced selective tax measures for those most in need , to help disadvantaged children and to assist charities .
whether in the classrooms , coaching sports teams , supervising clubs or directing a school play , teachers play an integral role in the development of our children .
i will quote a great Canadian who led this country into another century , Sir Wilfrid Laurier :
Mr. Speaker ,
Mr. Lynn Myers
as I travelled through Canada during the last four years , I saw how new technologies are strengthening rural Canada .
i urge the government to review the impact these changes will have on the most disadvantaged and to take action to ensure that the cost of restoring the viability of our pension plan is borne equally by all Canadians .
as a public figure I am used to the criticism from political opponents .
why did he not take action on that ?
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand
Mr. Speaker , I will just pick up from where I left off .
let us consider what the wheat board has always been charged to do along with the rights and needs of all producers .
is that agreed ?
Mr. Speaker , yesterday in this House I defended the TAGS program very strongly despite the fact that the opposition Reform Party blamed us for giving money to people who could not fish .
hon. Don Boudria
those conditions should not prevail in any civilized society .
worsening our inequalities can only gladden the hearts of those who seek to divide us .
Mr. Bill Gilmour
Mr. John Duncan
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Alex Shepherd :
second , individual members cannot table documents such as these .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to begin by telling the member for Edmonton - Strathcona how much I , and I am sure , my colleagues appreciate his speaking French in this House and speaking it very well .
Mr. Speaker , in a 1993 Liberal Party press release the prime minister described the decision to purchase much needed maritime helicopters as a colossal waste of taxpayers ' money .
despite the $ 800 million investment , an annual contribution of $ 180 million announced by the Minister of Finance in the February 1997 budget , it is clear that it will not offset the deep cuts made by the Liberals in recent years in R & D .
some hon. members :
hon. Lloyd Axworthy
Mr. Speaker , this is my first opportunity as the parliamentary secretary to the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board to address the very very important question raised by the hon. member .
if the net public debt were converted to $ 5 bills and laid end to end it would circle the earth 1,448 times .
we must eliminate the excessive surplus in the EI fund .
the answer is that there is still a deficit and there is still a debt .
Mr. Speaker , one of the things the people of Edmonton - Strathcona sent me here to try to accomplish is to recognize the view that , regardless of where people come from , regardless of their background , whether they are Quebecois or an Ismaili Muslim like myself , we are all equal .
introduction and first reading
the lesson for us is that we ought to make sure that when we transfer federal powers we transfer them in a way in which we can take them back if we need do so .
i am sorry to interrupt the member , but the member for Waterloo - Wellington has the floor .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
it has been argued that the incarceration periods for young offenders are far too short to instil any positive corrective behaviour .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
that is bad for business .
i have it in command to let you know that His Excellency the Governor General of Canada does not see fit to declare the causes of his summoning the present Parliament of Canada until a Speaker of the House of Commons shall have been chosen , according to law ; but tomorrow , Tuesday , September 23 , 1997 at 2.30 in the afternoon , His Excellency will declare the causes of his calling Parliament .
Mr. Speaker , on behalf of the Bloc quebecois , I would also like to extend our best wishes to Mrs. Hayes , who , I think , has done an outstanding job in representing the citizens of her riding .
we want to continue partnerships between private and public sectors .
most of the investment regulations under the Pension Benefit Standard Act will be applied to the board and the foreign property rule limit for pension funds will be strictly respected .
Mr. Speaker , I thank my colleague for his question , and I can tell him in reply that , of necessity , governing implies assuming responsibilities in a great many areas .
the Government wishes to recognize the important role of a professional , non - partisan public service in a well - performing civil society .
given what I have just said about the government ' s mismanagement , my party and myself consider his announced 50 / 50 policy to be a crock .
the Speech from the Throne provided the vision as to how this government , the 36 th Parliament , will continue to act on these principles , and to ensure and work to enhance the quality of living we experience as Canadians .
this will help to develop and strong and resilient economic base and foster partnerships among federal , provincial and aboriginal governments and the private sector .
over the past week the government has said that the passports were forgeries .
* * *
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
this means that in order to maintain the current benefit structure , contribution rates need to increase by 14 % of income by the year 2030 .
Mr. Speaker , I think the question is entirely irrelevant .
i sometimes think the Reform Party has a talent for moving the obvious in this House when it comes to certain things .
Mr. Philip Mayfield
hon. David M. Collenette
yesterday in releasing an interim report on the accident , the Transportation Safety Board noted that its recommendations are the same ones it made three years ago following a crash at Brighton , Ontario .
he also talked about how the plan was improperly set up in the first place , in a sense , and admitted basically that it was a pyramid scheme .
perhaps my friends in the Bloc would be interested to know something .
i seems that is what the government is doing .
now I hear this member putting on this caring , sharing concern for the Canadian public .
the minister states that a member of Parliament cannot receive this information based on the signatories of the band present authorizing me to do so .
given his responsibilities in this matter , does the minister intend to take action to compensate them and to finally regulate this sector ?
in recent years , tough decisions have had to be made , ones that have been both hard to make and hard to accept in some ways .
of course , we use inclusive terms such as " society '' .
deception , absolutely , because in fact the Speech from the Throne did also not mention that under the present formula of this government dollars from the federal government to provincial governments will actually decline in real terms .
the message Quebeckers were sending to Lucien Bouchard and his followers was loud and clear : " Enough about your special interests .
this having been said , our caucus continues to believe that , before amending the Constitution , the three tests referred to must be done .
our passport enjoys unparalleled respect the world over , undoubtedly a reason that the Mossad found it useful .
my friend says it was a major plank .
farmers and producers themselves will have a direct role in the management of that agency and they will control their destiny .
how does the hon. member dare say that his government can represent each and every citizen when it is being bribed by big business and refuses to take the necessary actions to fix the tax loopholes -
as the minister is aware , there are in excess of 30,000 illegal immigrants in Canada today .
the deficit is an amount of money that one borrows .
we are here to oppose .
the prime minister said " It is a nice problem to contemplate this surplus .
we know that getting relevant work experience is increasingly important to help make the transition from school to work .
this is where the government should have saved money instead of cutting transfer payments to the provinces to be able to act later on and appear to be a generous big brother , a kindly father willing to meet the needs of the nation .
from now on when provinces borrow from the CPP they will pay the same rate of interest as they do on the market .
the strengthening of federal internship programs will provide participants with real job experience , the lack of which too often prevents young people from finding meaningful work .
if ever he would like to improve his French by coming with me to meet those who are actively involved in the Quebec educational system , I would be only too pleased to do so .
Canadians have every right to expect the federal government to set the right priorities and policies , and to chart the right course to achieve what they need for the future .
let me be very clear .
do we have those passports in our control now and when are you going to have them back in this country ?
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
in particular , we announced a youth employment strategy , which is extremely important .
i noticed that schedule II contains a comparison of existing CPP provisions and the proposed changes .
foreign AFFAIRS
Mr. Speaker , the member is profoundly misinformed .
not only did we do well , we got rid of another two Liberal MLAs in the legislature .
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅
the Speaker :
as I think of the hopeful yet troubled eyes of the young people I met this summer , I become even more determined that our government will not evade its own responsibilities and opportunities .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a question of privilege in regard to a very grave matter relating to information that I sought from officials at the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs .
while there may be many different proposals to achieve this , one thing is clear .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
i do not hear a hue and cry across the country for more spending .
at present the CPP has a fund equal to about two years ' worth of benefits .
criminal CODE
if the board of directors considers the exclusion to be a significant change , a vote of the producers would also have to be held .
the proposal is to extend CPP coverage up the income scale by raising the limit on pensionable earnings .
* * *
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
another concern is that the Minister of Finance publicly indicated the 80 percent rule where 80 percent of pension moneys must be invested in the country is likely to be increased .
i think it is more than 400,000 .
the Deputy Speaker :
Mr. John Bryden :
last February a federal - provincial agreement was reached on changes to ensure that the Canada pension plan would be sustainable in the future and would make it more fair and more affordable for all Canadians .
Mr. Speaker , my hon. colleague refers to our government ' s endangered species protection legislation .
Mr. Guy St - Julien
we have tremendously talented artists who need to have their work marketed .
what are Canadians to think when they hear all the damning evidence which clearly points to such inappropriate conduct ?
conseil QU 脡 B 脡 COIS DU PATRIMOINE VIVANT
this is a totally illogical decision .
they were the first with a welfare state in the world .
for these reasons , the Government of Canada has decided to leave the RCMP forces in place during this period of change .
they are reminded also of the conflict of interest guidelines should they choose to take outside employment during this unpaid leave .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
Mr. Bill Matthews
inter - PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION
i am thankful for that experience .
agreed .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
we must overwhelm narrow minded nationalism with broad minded federalism .
canada would mix the plutonium with uranium oxide for use as nuclear reactor fuel .
i would like to ask this member to respond specifically to my question .
i know he has extensive personal experience in the field .
hon. Paul Martin
* * *
Mr. Jerry Pickard ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
i am not stating that something is illegal .
similarly if they vote to exclude something , are they not the ones to make that decision ?
i believe what is happening is that some people do not understand what is going on in Atlantic Canada .
routine PROCEEDINGS
in order to assess this reform , let us take a brief look at the history of the Canada pension plan .
this requirement has been met .
he told me that this requirement was impossible to fulfil .
liberal , Tory , same old story .
what one knows , the other should know .
we pay $ 47 billion in interest payments on the debt each and every year .
it is made up of people who are coping with the difficulties of everyday life .
to put this in perspective , working Canadians will have contributed over $ 110,000 to the EI surplus during the short 10 minutes it takes me to debate the Speech from the Throne .
average people from Alberta were consulted in this three day session .
if the hon. member for Beauharnois - Salaberry wishes to say something , he has the floor .
they understand what matters .
it was essentially a process that promoted offloading on to the province ' s national government responsibilities .
in addition , I would like to congratulate all my colleagues on being elected to office .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
canada is ready .
Ms. Libby Davies
nutrition is an essential component of an individual ' s health .
the other concern the Reform Party has with this motion is the amount of time that the government is providing to the committee to complete its work .
indeed it is the duty of the official opposition to point out these defects .
the RCMP and the commissioner were advised of this a long time ago .
we in this caucus believe that it is time to end the uncertainty which has surrounded the Canadian Wheat Board .
the Speech from the Throne delivered yesterday is , in my opinion , a speech on national unity .
order .
we respect that process and will continue to respect it .
madam Speaker , I am pleased to table , in both official languages , a number of order in council appointments made by the government .
Mr. Speaker , I believe I answered this question in full earlier .
that is why I stress the importance of the timeliness of this debate .
concerned with putting its financial house in order , the government , during its first mandate , brought all existing support programs and the Canada Assistance Plan together under a single umbrella called the Canada health and social transfer .
they also need to be able to plan for themselves beyond whatever government can do .
Mr. Jay Hill
Mr. Parliamentary Secretary , can you share with the House -
it essentially implies that such investments in youth and in the Canada foundation for innovation will be a threat to our nation ' s fiscal future and long term economic prosperity .
that shows that ethics is a consideration for Liberals only when it suits them .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) :
one thing that B.C. will likely be asking for is to be treated equally , nothing more , nothing less .
i should point out that this inclusion clause is confined to crops that fall within the definition of grain now in the Canadian Wheat Board Act , that is oats , flax , rye and canola .
we said that we would invest in areas which would generate economic growth and increase our productivity as a country , understanding full well that in order to compete in an international economy we need to have the type of regulatory framework which speaks to the decisions which will generate wealth in order to generate the revenues which will result in the type of social programs to which Canadians have grown accustomed .
if both are the same , then why are we changing the wording ?
hon. Anne McLellan
i also ask the leader of the NDP to convey our best wishes to her predecessor , Ms. Audrey McLaughlin .
i want to commend the government where it deserves commendation .
there are new members here today , 76 years later , the men and women who make up the NDP caucus who still see this as the key question facing us .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
it is only good when it is spread around .
he talks on the one hand of the emissions that are creating ozone depletion .
there is also the pioneering Western Front artist run centre in Mount Pleasant , the Italian Cultural Centre and the new Chinese Cultural Centre Museum .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
in fact there is so much confidence as we approach the next millennium that the Prime Minister in the throne speech announced that we are going to have a tremendous millennium party in two and a half years , a party which I believe the world will come to because people around the world know that we have a country that cares about people .
does this mean , assuming we proceed , that religious or pastoral teaching will no longer have its place in schools ?
* * *
the plan no longer will lend funds to the provinces at preferred rates .
retirement pensions for disability beneficiaries will be based on the maximum pensionable earnings at the time of disability and then fully price indexed to age 65 .
there is also the wonderful Canadian nurse who looked after the English patient .
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , first I would like to offer my apologies for a raspy , scratchy voice .
to conclude , let me tell you what the Bloc ' s priorities will be for the years to come :
finally , they request that the expression dietary supplement include any substance that is intended to improve or augment the nutritional quality of one ' s diet and may include tablets , capsules , powders or liquids containing one or more of the following ingredients : a vitamin , a mineral , an amino acid , an herb or other botanical or concentrate metabolite constituent , extract or combination of these ingredients .
this past year we had two unfortunate and tragic incidents in Canada , the Saguenay and the Manitoba floods .
i wonder if they really know what they are doing to the people of Canada .
* * *
as a socialist and as a trade unionist I reject the prevailing wisdom that we can no longer afford Canadian social programs .
hon. Jane Stewart
the member has about 30 seconds to wrap up his speech .
i will take as broad a view as possible , but I will bring to bear precisely on the issues raised by the hon. member for Wild Rose and the response by the hon. minister .
just to bring it to the attention of the RCMP is not enough .
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate my hon. colleague ' s question .
the amount of money which will be taken out of the local Kamloops ' economy as a result of individual contributions and company contributions which match them will add up to approximately $ 80 million annually .
partnerships work .
i would ask please , that we stay somewhere close to the bill that we are debating which is of course the wheat board bill .
this means that individuals will own all the assets in their account and their retirement benefits will be substantially greater .
last year , the minister pocketed $ 5 billion , even though it has been years since the federal government contributed to the employment insurance fund .
remember that the opposition party completely supported that bill .
Sharon Hayes and her husband will be in our thoughts and prayers .
the government House leader is incorrect in his assertion that the amendments may be an avenue to limit debate .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew
in light of the decision reached yesterday with respect to the bill to freeze the annual CPP exemption at $ 3,500 a year , and the fact that it will hit low income earners , women and the disabled of this country very hard , can he explain why he wants to shift the burden onto low income people ?

Mr. Daniel Turp
Ms. Elinor Caplan
government ORDERS
i think that is what a government should do .
according to the memo the minister suggested that the government might use conciliation to delay negotiations , blame the unions for a strike and then introduce back to work legislation within eight days of any strike action .
i notice that a significant majority of Quebeckers are now saying they feel they would be better off within a united Canada .
many of them are housekeeping items and minor changes and amendments that affect very few people .
Mr. Myron Thompson
in 1980 he moved to Durham regional council and in 1991 was elected as mayor of the town of Whitby .
Mr. Pierre Brien
the leader of our party , the hon. member for Sherbrooke , has warned that the tax and cut government of the Liberals ' first term has been replaced by the tax and spend government in the second .
i find this a good test of democracy .
i was very disappointed to see the member from Burnaby do what he did yesterday because I think this debases the debate in the House .
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate the new member on her question .
the Liberal government should take a major initiative .
i am not making this up .
youth unemployment has become a serious problem in Canada and particularly in my riding of Sault Ste. Marie .
governments have a responsibility to ensure the widest possible access to learning at all levels .
madam Speaker , I would like to congratulate you on your position as Acting Speaker of the House .
Mr. Jean Dub 茅 ( Madawaska - Restigouche , PC ) :
we are having a crisis of work in this country .
QUEBEC PREMIER
Mr. Preston Manning
they did not scrap it , it is still there .
Mr. Stan Dromisky ( Thunder Bay - Atikokan , Lib . ) :
we need to make some fundamental changes so that the Canada Elections Act cannot be abused during writ periods .
it was all for that inquiry as long as it was looking into the misdeeds of the Tory government .
i would like to thank the leader of my party for being there .
it is jointly managed by federal and provincial governments .
since , according to the latest report , the Reform Party received 925 donations from companies , for a total of $ 815,520 , does that mean that the Reform Party is in the pay of those companies that contributed money to the official opposition ?
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
a constituent applied four years ago and has since developed terminal cancer .
( 20 ) to the Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages
one in three Canadian jobs depend on trade .
the government ' s new fund will not help 90 percent of the students who need financial assistance .
instead of helping rural communities overcome the lack of jobs , the federal government is taking away from the unemployed the necessary tools that could help them rejoin the labour market .
every day we have stood and asked straightforward information - gathering questions of the prime minister , of the foreign affairs minister , of whomever the files seemed to be pawned off on that particular day .
what do Canadians hold sacred ?
if we had citizens rights to initiative and referendum at the federal level it would make a major difference .
together we will move into the next millennium as a prosperous , tolerant , generous , caring and modern country .
we need to talk about these issues .
i thought I would start by getting it on the record , in case the member for Medicine Hat was not aware , that we will be the first government in almost three decades to balance the budget .
the road was rough and winding .
we have to mobilize our resources toward a clear objective of being the best .
introduction and first reading
surpluses will still be generated by the end of next year , since the forecast is better than anticipated as far as reducing the deficit and running budget surpluses is concerned .
this is a blatant disregard for the rights of taxpayers .
some families with one parent at home pay thousands of dollars more each year than their double income counterparts .
we need to ask that question with respect to a very broad range of issues that are now before this government , before this House , before us as members all the way from the question of Quebec separation to these issues of schools and the constitutional amendments which are being challenged by it .
the government claims to be strengthening these three pillars by this and upcoming legislation .
on April 29 , 1971 Speaker Lamoureux , in a ruling on a question of privilege concerning rights of members to visit penitentiaries at page 5338 of the Debates stated that :
but there is more .
what struck me forcefully was a presentation by aboriginal peoples and the dates of points of significance to those people of which I was not aware .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien :
this shows once again that the Reform Party and the Bloc both want our federal system to be changed in order to give more autonomy to the provinces in areas that directly affect their cultural and economic characteristics .
could we have a direct comment on Mr. Bouchard having so much difficulty ?
it is my duty , pursuant to Standing Order 38 , to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows : the hon. member for Cumberland - Colchester - Infrastructure .
section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , which guarantees linguistic minorities the right to instruction in their own language , will continue to provide solid guarantees to Quebec ' s anglophones as it has in the past .
the bill went through second reading in June and should pass third reading soon after the National Assembly reconvenes for a new session .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
these jobs were not created as a result of team Canada trade missions .
where is the compassion ?
i am convinced that an increased knowledge of the other would bring greater understanding to those who are ambivalent about Canadian unity .
* * *
it too has to size up : " Do we go to the wall ?
he has done nothing to analyse the positive impact of that private sector investment of people ' s contributions on the economy .
the fact is as long as there is any deficit the debt will increase .
what I have often observed in watching parliamentary debates is that often individuals are so wrapped up in their own view and in shouting down and heckling others that one does not hear what is being said .
it is not just a western grain issue , ladies and gentlemen .
while the Bloc Quebecois supports this reform ' s objective , which is to preserve this public pension plan , increasing contribution rates faster than initially planned will cause an increase in benefit funding .
instead of going at 100 kilometres an hour as I approach this truck , I begin to speed up at a slower rate .
the cynicism of the government in papering over the cracks in this plan has not yet been exposed .
Mr. Bob Kilger :
the Oktoberfest parade on October 13 is a nationally televised event which enables families everywhere to enjoy the spirit of " Gemutlichkeit " which means good cheer and good will which is so much part of this celebration .
both of these achievements , one social and the other economic , are testimony to the fact that we did not sacrifice our vision of Canada , a country that is strong and united , a country that values healthy children and strong families living in safe communities , a country where everyone believes in the dignity of work and the importance of self - reliance , a country in which young people have hope for a better future , a country where we share responsibility for each other , especially the most vulnerable among us , and a country where diversity is seen as a great source of strength .
this is a travesty when it comes to parliamentary democracy and they should be ashamed of themselves .
let me turn quickly to the social safety net and particularly the subject of intergenerational transfers and what it has meant in the past to be a Canadian .
Ms. Marlene Catterall ( Ottawa West - Nepean , Lib . ) :
the difference is complex , as is the calculation .
the maximum contribution will go from $ 975 to about $ 1,635 .
can the minister confirm that he will do everything necessary to assure himself that no member of the Montreal office has had contact with an individual under investigation by the name of Pierre Corbeil ?
the reality of government funding and government financing is that is not possible .
budgets and throne speeches must reflect Canadian values .
it has been alleged that there was no consultation .
poverty is not something that we have to accept as a reality .
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) :
if one visits the riding one will find that old Thornhill straddles both sides of Yonge Street , part of it in the town of Vaughan and part of it in Markham .
i would encourage all hon. members to be very judicious .
in the federal government ' s response to the report tabled in 1996 the government expressed agreement with many of the recommendations and solidly committed to make environmental regulations affecting mining more efficient .
that is why there are no corporate donations allowed in Quebec , only public funding .
Mr. Speaker , the CRTC violated its own rules by awarding a wireless cable broadcasting licence to a telephone monopoly .
in the Speech from the Throne we talked about the surplus which now exists in the treasury but we did not hear about how it was brought about .
not only are we listening to Canadians but we are also acting to ensure that our policy reflects their concerns .
you will be surprised when we reveal these figures .
Mr. Speaker , just months prior to the last federal election the former Liberal member for Cape Breton - East Richmond authorized a $ 300,000 fund to be given to a private group to study the privatization of the Donkin mine in Cape Breton .
democracy requires that all citizens be able to express their views on the important issues of the day .
the two major concerns expressed by British Columbians have been that such recognition will provide Quebec with special rights , powers or privileges that are not available to other provinces , and second , that such recognition would diminish the notion that all Canadians are equal and all provinces are equal .
the formula worked .
i happen to feel that the people who stood in the way of Meech Lake back in 1990 will be judged very harshly by history .
* * *
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel :
investments in that regard made today will pay enormous dividends tomorrow .
my hon. colleague from Churchill River would not stand up , because it is unparliamentary , to ask the member to take back the remark he just made .
i ask , Mr. Speaker , that he take back that remark , which borders on racism toward this man ' s heritage .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
i appreciate her concern and her will to make Quebec part of Canada .
Mr. Speaker , let me thank the hon. member for her question .
Mr. Speaker , I am not aware of the allegations that the member has made , but the role of solicitor general is not to interfere with the operation of the RCMP .
they should be able to know that some security is there for their old age .
we will balance the budget no later than fiscal year 1998 - 99 , the first time in three decades .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
thanks to the foresight of the four Atlantic premiers an Atlantic vision conference is being organized next month in Moncton .
i found him eloquent on the subject of the government ' s ideas .
as I said in my speech , Inuit are very adaptable people .
there was a stormy debate in the House of Commons .
the Chair also recognizes the sensitivity and would ask the hon. member for Calgary Southeast to ensure that when that kind of word is used it is very clearly put in the context of the abstract .
that is when political leadership is really tried , when one has to go beyond appealing to the crowd and saying will it be Barabas or will it be Christ , saying it is up to the people and making a choice of your own as to what is right .
Mr. Richard Marceau
this is certainly good news for all Canadians .
i get calls across the way that it may be boring .
hon. David Anderson
this will be the first time in almost 30 years that the country has had a balanced budget .
CALGARY DECLARATION
possibly it is misnamed .
because it is almost two o ' clock we will now proceed to statements by members .
today I would like to say to him that young Quebecers dream of freedom and aspire to sovereignty .
the tax measures that the government has put in place over the period of many years has driven many Canadians out of the country .
consider that 75 percent of all businesses in Canada have less than five employees .
liberals should be ashamed .
it is that business is bad and anything that business does is bad and instead of thinking of how we can increase the pie we have to think about how we can divide up the pie .
one of the challenges we face as a nation is youth unemployment .
he should have said , in a democratic country such as Canada : " There is no question of it , it is a purely political question '' .
hon. Paul Martin
* * *
immigration
his memory seems to hallow the very ground on which we stand .
the soon to come new seniors ' benefit package , which has major implications for future retirees , will come at a later date but today we are talking about amendments that the government is suggesting to the Canada pension plan .
we are prepared to create innovation because innovation is important .
for every dollar that the federal government has invested in the arts industry ten dollars of economic activity has been generated , an excellent rate of return .
we have the people , we have the resources , we have the technology and we have the infrastructure .
the figures are in ; I am sure she is aware of them .
first , individuals currently receiving pension , disability , survivor or combined benefits under the CPP will see no change in their benefits .
we have seen it with the moves in the establishment of independent , arm ' s length agencies , in research infrastructure and now in scholarships .
the protectionist rage which snapped a golden age of trade in the U.S. in the 1930 s turned a severe recession into a great depression .
we recognize that there is a need for amendments to the act .
i would ask the member to think of a subsequent Canada - Russian series in which there was an absolutely sublime pass from the boy from Brantford to Super Mario and Super Mario deked the goalie and tucked it in upstairs .
again , in 1996 , the numbers for 1996 are in this library book .
hon. Andy Scott
i hope committee goes through it in detail because the major producers of western Canada deserve more of an option than what they have been given under this bill , for this is a billion dollar industry .
not one penny of contributions will go to the general revenue fund .
Mr. Speaker , first I must advise the hon. member that I cannot comment on the particulars of the case in relation to the decision of the cabinet about upholding or sending back a CRTC ' s decision .
let me say that as we sit here today there are still foreigners who are flagrantly overfishing on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks .
that will be helpful .
* * *
it is always the same rhetoric for the haves .
they are finding that they can no longer depend on even their pensions being honoured .
house OF COMMONS
all Canadians have a stake in meeting these challenges .
for service in France he was awarded the Military Cross and after his return to Canada received the Efficiency Decoration .
it is the Liberal government .
the next time there is a cabinet meeting I hope he and his colleagues will take a second to read what is written there .
Ms. Diane St - Jacques
seventh , if a public consensus can be achieved with respect to an appropriate level and pattern of federal spending , taxation and indebtedness , what measures are required to ensure the federal government respects those targets and lives within its means ?
employment INSURANCE
she says the health protection branch is unsafe .
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron
the revolution in the knowledge and information economy is transforming all sectors of the economy from primary resources to service industries .
when the prime minister was lobbying him , when he was saying " show me the money '' , where were his boy scout ethics then ?
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan
the changes in the legislation have been put forward so that Canadians do not have to suffer the uncertainty which has been purported by opposition members .
it is important to look at the Canada pension plan in the perspective of this reform of the seniors benefit .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅
Ms. Bev Desjarlais :
what does the throne speech tell us ?
the federal plan is currently identical to the QPP in that respect .
dairy INDUSTRY
there are few words available with which to describe it .
we had a meeting of our little caucus unity team just this week .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
hon. Jim Peterson ( for the Minister of Finance ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 10 , an act to implement a convention between Canada and Sweden , a convention between Canada and the Republic of Lithuania , a convention between Canada and the Republic of Kazakhstan , a convention between Canada and the Republic of Iceland and a convention between Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income and to amend the Canada - Netherlands Income Tax Convention Act , 1986 and the Canada - United States Tax Convention Act , 1986 .
for all those people in my riding , whether they voted Reform or whatever party , they may be absolutely certain that we will be looking out for their affairs as equal individuals participating in our communities .
i have exactly the same problem with the Conservative premier of Manitoba who takes a program which we designed and operated and pulls it into his riding and presents it as his own .
when we look at language , when we look at law , when we look at culture , there is every reason for the country to embrace the province of Quebec as a distinct society or a unique society , whatever word we want to put on it .
realizing these aspirations fully will require the active engagement of Canadians in all walks of life , as well as our institutions , businesses , voluntary organizations and our governments .
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Brossard - La Prairie , Lib . ) :
Mr. Paul Bonwick
Mr. Jay Hill :
there is no such thing as paying off the deficit .
Mr. Jean Dub 茅 :
he did that also in the other part of the northern part of the province .
the allegations in question are very serious and appear increasingly well founded as we learn more about the involvement of a Liberal Party activist who was able to approach companies with confidential information .
madam Speaker , since I have no right to pick up props and show them , I will look at them .
Mr. Speaker , I see a theme evolving on the Bloc benches .
it is the last thing Canadians want .
Mr. Speaker , I think I saw that movie last week .
Mr. Preston Manning
it is my duty , pursuant to Standing Order 38 , to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Waterloo - Wellington , children ; the hon. member for Vancouver East , post - secondary education ; the hon. member for West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , foreign affairs .
i also remember the leader of the Reform Party saying that he would never move into Stornoway .
Ms. Michelle Dockrill
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
it is in Quebec that second language teaching is the most rigorous .
i would like to invite all hon. members to a reception , which I will be hosting in their name , for Mr. Atom Egoyan in my chambers following the question period .
two people charged in an attack on a Jordanian Hamas leader were carrying Canadian passports .
nowhere is the challenge greater than in the aboriginal communities of this country .
someday the justice system will represent mainstream Canadian values where we protect our children and properly denounce discrimination and violence .
can we trust the Liberals with our pensions ?
i am confident that this Speech from the Throne will meet with their approval as we gather for our first town hall meeting on the 36 th Parliament on October 1 .
we all know that .
the tone was excellent , the kind of tone that befits the issues she intends to defend .
we are strongly committed , and I want to make it very clear , to rights .
they propose to do that through the single largest payroll tax grab in our history .
we are having a bit of fun here .
some hon. members :
the future of our country calls on us to make responsible ongoing investments aimed at improving the educational and job prospects of young Canadians .
i would like hon. members opposite to point out when they go about their constituency consultations that they do not want farmers who sit on this board of directors to have any protections whatsoever , to have any sort of umbrella within the Canadian Wheat Board .
in 1994 the words were cautious , the commitments solemn .
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau :
hear , hear .
Mr. Speaker , I am outraged at this kind of behaviour .
but in a way it is also invigorating because it will give me the opportunity over the next few years along with my colleagues to speak about these problems in this place .
the government should not be injecting money into the private sector .
justice
they can work if the government takes the trouble to listen to people , to think , to give some thought to the long term , and to show some compassion , while behaving in a financially responsible manner .
revenue CANADA
the Deputy Speaker :
not the kind of generalized , useless tax reduction which does nothing to stimulate consumer buying and job creation , but targeted reductions based on a logical analysis of the tax system .
they wanted to see an independent board .
Mr. Speaker , I did not have the honour of knowing Mr. Ellis , to whom tribute is being paid today , personally .
i call their use of the phrase tax fairness a buzzword .
canada PENSION PLAN
i disagree .
in that province when people had a chance to have input into what they wanted to do with any surpluses , they said they wanted to pay down the debt .
Mr. Gilles - A .
we have the talent , we have the resources , we have the technology , and we have the institutions .
the Senate
it is in that context that I appeal to my hon. members across the way to stop their campaigns to destroy what has been and continues to be the most beautiful and most successful partnership in the world .
the nominating committee , in turn , will name an arm ' s length board of experts .
i would ask members who were present last time to reflect back on the 35 th Parliament .
we were getting along even though we disagree with each other politically .
i have already noticed that as you get older a few rust spots appear and you need more body work .
police OFFICERS OF CANADA
Mr. Rick Laliberte :
it is in our power to make that kind of evaluation and assessment .

Mr. Denis Coderre
Mr. Speaker , I ask that you review these matters and if you find there is a prima facie question of privilege I am prepared to move the appropriate motion .
i assure you of my complete co - operation in the proceedings of this parliamentary institution , in which I intend to behave with dignity and respect .
they have played that old record so much that , as the Cyniques , an old comedy group of the 70 s , used to say , you can hear the other side of it .

procedure AND HOUSE AFFAIRS
madam Speaker , congratulations on your appointment .
madam Speaker , I am pleased to participate in the debate on the Bloc motion which condemns the attitude of the government in that it refused to introduce complete reform of legislation on the financing of federal political parties , even though the existing legislation allows for a wide range of abuses .
the hon. member knows that a few years ago we introduced a bill that looked after merchant seamen .
political parties may accept contributions if the parties have registered status .
Quebecers are Quebecers , and just as proud to be Canadians .
for a lot of people in my constituency it is the difference between being able to take a holiday in a year , being able to take their kids for a trip in the summer , and perhaps being able to hire an extra employee to help them so they can actually go home a few nights a week and spend some extra time with their families .
their allies overseas and outside this country know differently .
routine PROCEEDINGS
the plan is also periodically reviewed .
as such the government reduced payroll taxes , reduced general taxation and reduced regulations on small business .
the hon. member for Scarborough Centre for a very short answer .
that takes some doing .
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard
it is a message that should be heard .
these are Canadians who had a totally different dimension of Canadian life during what we would consider as their prime working years .
hon. Alfonso Gagliano
the Chair heard no such word or inference from the hon. member for Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke .
why does the hon. member for Sherbrooke not recognize the legitimacy of Quebec ' s approach and the general consensus over this issue in the province ?
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
what is wrong with electing all of the members to this board ?
Mrs. Pauline Picard
we are closely co - operating with our partners , namely the Quebec government , the companies and the unions .
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister of Canada who is the member for Saint - Maurice , will always work to make sure that the people who live in his riding are treated the same way as people in the other ridings in Canada .
women actually supported tax cuts to a greater degree than did men .
the second round of discussions occurred at a forum .
Mr. Speaker , we acted extremely diligently because we immediately called back the ambassador to Canada for consultation .
i do not know .
tragic 745 hearings continue to tear communities apart .
i am going to find that out and report back to the member .

Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
i have problems with what we will be doing here .
what kind of suits could you possibly wear for $ 31,000 a year ?
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Veterans Affairs .
they made an immense contribution toward the evolution of this place through a fairly revolutionary time .
my colleagues opposite will surely have the opportunity to find out why real soon , if they have not done so already .
this is a very welcome step .
the government is confirming its interference in the health field by creating a pharmacare plan , when Quebec already has its own such plan .
Mr. Speaker , once contracts have been awarded , we have a policy of issuing a press release on the contracts awarded .
Mr. Ted McWhinney
it is a very comprehensive one and a very good one because it is backed by the Government of Canada .
it was an issue we discussed in the last Parliament .
MINNIJEAN BROWN TRICKEY
the only difference between a third and a half is a sixth .
it is going to provide more capital for small and medium size business .
all those present in the House know of the sacrifices that an elected official must make and the toll that an election campaign and representation in Ottawa can take .
today I want to pay tribute to Sharon Hayes , who is now demonstrating her commitment to family in the most profound way possible .
in addition , what I would like to do , with help , I hope , from a few colleagues , even from my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois , is to talk frankly about what we can do together to ensure that science , innovation and technology can help us meet the great challenges facing our society .
regulating leasing is the responsibility of the provincial governments .
the member for Markham made reference to that .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
a mere mention of these two events is sufficient to remind us of the immensity of the disasters which struck these areas and the immensity of the needs they created .
Ms. Libby Davies
there were also some negative points .
the Speaker
Quebecers stood their ground and I am proud of that .
i received $ 23,870 from 109 donors , and they were only individual contributions .
they do not have the opportunity of getting the information that we would like to see .
rights OF THE CHILD
is this the example we want to set for our young children ?
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
the fact is that in the throne speech there is a clear commitment to continue to deal with the issue of foreign overfishing .
QUEBEC PREMIER
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton
we know full well that in the recent history of the Constitution , no precedent has been created .
the first thing it did was consult Canadians to make them aware of the problem .
what criteria did the government use to determine how this formula would work ?
although they were subjected to all kinds of opposition , phoney road bans , phoney literature being spread about it , the farmers said they want an option .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
the intent of these changes is to give us better options and to ensure the viability of the plan .
it was brought about by decimating longstanding meaningful community infrastructures which have given us pride and a sense of ourselves and where we come from .
you can only go on so long increasing premiums and reducing benefits before the political will is not there any longer to support the idea of the Canada pension plan .
* * *
hopefully the member can make the distinction .
i hope that the pride that they are entitled to feel at the end of Mr. Knowles ' life tempers the sense of loss which , regardless of age and its infirmities , must still be great indeed .
hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
currently there are over 4,000 people in Canada waiting for their appeal to be heard .
even in the west , the political elite is starting to come face to face with reality .
Mr. Speaker , tomorrow I will have pleasure of attending the facilities expansion celebration of Hybrid Turkeys in Kitchener .
this report is deemed to have been permanently referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights .
i wish to put before the House an outline of my understanding of what occurred that day and the rationale for the official ' s actions .
committees OF THE HOUSE
the hon. member ' s province has a very similar quotation in the Manitoba act .
Mr. Speaker , having spent 10 years in opposition in the province of Ontario I understand full well the temptation to speculate on what will be contained in something .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te
i invite him to come and visit that area to understand what New Quebec is all about .
these people who are not in opposition or in government are able to say positive things about the government and what it has done .
the minister also retained the power to appoint the chair of the board of directors as well as the president of the board .
it is a balanced approach .
some of my constituents are waiting to see if he will use that label for the Bloc .
that might very well explain some of the frustration that I am seeing across the way .
it has been wasted , pocketed , misappropriated , gone missing , blown on fancy trips and plundered in 100 different ways .
in particular , Canadians told us loud and clear that they wanted the government to get tough on violent high risk offenders .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
petitions
we are getting into debate now .
we have a stranglehold on you and we will cut your grants for the CBC .
we no longer have an animal pathology lab .
younger Canadians want the CPP to be there when they need it .
the very fact that those people belong to a minority group should keep them outside of that particular process .
these comments will be made a little later by my colleague , the hon. member for South Surrey - White Rock - Langley .
recognizing that organized crime knows no jurisdictional boundaries , our efforts to fight it are and will continue to be domestic , continental and international in scope .
why does the government restrict the debate for ordinary members of the House of Commons when it is the most important tax issue in this entire Parliament ?
producers want answers now .
it had been forecasted that there would be no money left in the fund by the year 2015 , at which time contribution rates would have gone up from 6 % to 14 % for the Canada pension plan , and from 6 % to 13 % for the Quebec pension plan .
budget constraints force us as a nation to set priorities and find efficiencies .
we have come a long way , but the road ahead is still a long one .
i suspect that Canadians will be shocked later today when they find out that when the government decided to sell off the air navigation system to the private sector it only charged $ 1.5 billion when its own department said it was worth $ 2.4 billion .
that is the biggest cause in this country of the debt and deficit .
i had the honour of attending the third annual competition in St. John ' s , Newfoundland .

congratulations to GFI and congratulations to Technology Partnerships Canada .
Mr. Speaker , my question of privilege arises out of the motion that the government intends to move with respect to time allocation on Bill C - 2 .
will the government tell us what it is doing about this or should we just call the media ?
i will keep the hon. member posted .
in twenty years or so , this will have changed to four workers for every retired person and , when today ' s young people retire forty years from now , the proportion will be three for every one .
i urge Canadians who are watching the debate today , if they do not watch any other debate the rest of the year - and some of us wonder why they would - to watch the one on Monday .
why , in the case involving influence peddling , did the Prime Minister not act like his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and comply with the government ' s code of conduct by suspending the person suspected of wrongdoing until all the facts were known ?
because of that , on behalf of my party , I want to extend to his family and to his friends our very sincere condolences on his passing .
based on the research I have conducted in preparing my bill , it became apparent that CPP premiums would have to be increased if the pension system were to survive .
yet I thought they had just handed that over to the provinces .
interparliamentary DELEGATIONS
finally , it is a region where everybody loves the great outdoors .
where is the vision for agriculture to carry this vital industry into the new millennium ?
they often need that second chance .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
post - SECONDARY EDUCATION
i wish them good luck .
the DIPP , the defence industry productivity program , went essentially to the defence industry .
it fixes a problem that has been identified and it ensures that the plan is viable into the future .
issues were addressed quickly and effectively with meaningful consultation among stakeholders .
the Prime Minister and his government say that they are going to spend that money because they have learned nothing from the last 30 years .
canada by this time had embraced the railroads and more than anything else developed the interior territories by threads of rails emanating from its rapidly growing cities of Montreal and Toronto .
one of the clearest messages that we received during the consultations is that Canadians want and need the Canada pension plan .
madam Speaker , on behalf of the hon. member for Mount Royal and pursuant to Standing Order 34 ( 1 ) , I have the honour to present to the House , in both official languages , the report of the Canadian group of interparliamentary union which represented Canada at the 1997 interparliamentary conference held in Seoul , the Republic of Korea , from April 9 to April 15 , 1997 .
request FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE
i begin by thanking the people of Guelph - Wellington for the trust and confidence they gave me and the Liberal Party on June 2 .
families want restored back to them the authority to raise their children in a manner that they think is in the best interests of them , their communities and this country .
the Speaker :
in total it adds up to higher payments for young Canadians than our plan .
for instance , I know there are people in Shiloh , Manitoba who have made similar representations to me about the alternative service delivery .
in the address the right hon. prime minister spoke of a disturbing study showing that Canadians knew very little about one another .
the program is still there .
our youth programs are aimed at ensuring that the youth of today can make the transition to tomorrow , can get access to education , can get experience in the workplace and can get a job in the future .
given the party financing practices at the federal level -
Kitchener - Waterloo , along with Cambridge and Guelph , provide one example of how people at the local level - in business , government , social agencies and unions - helped this region make the transition from old industrial Ontario - what the Americans call rust - belt economy - to a new knowledge based one .
Mr. Speaker , over 25 percent of the population use or rely on natural health care products .
like millions of other immigrants who have built our great country , my parents came to Canada in search of a better life for themselves and their children .
Mr. Speaker , I find it very offensive for this member to speak on one hand about co - operation in this House and raising the level of debate and making Canada work , and then to make accusations of the Reform Party that we are not a party that wants the country to keep together .
the question is out of order .
we are doing it with the provinces and with the lenders as well as we can .
that is democracy and it is not happening in the House today .
i served as mayor of Saint John for 11 years , so perhaps I worked with Frank more closely than anyone else in the House .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew :
is the Webster dictionary right about democracy or is the Liberal government right ?
instead of making changes why don ' t you scrap the CPP ?
speech FROM THE THRONE
my party is looking at this type of plan to help Canadians get a plan which will give them something they can retire on .
i mentioned to him at one time that his failure to represent his constituents on an issue would probably come back to haunt him .
only then would the people of Canada have an opportunity to discuss and debate the issues on the future of their country .
this is the whole idea of a question period which is a little fuller and called the late show .
Mr. Speaker , this whole problem started when the current health minister was the justice minister .
it chose to run deficits year after year .
without our own product , without our own voices , without a generation that shares our vision to keep our culture alive and meaningful , Canada will have no legacy .
Ms. Jocelyne Bujold Girard
i think the NDP needs to be a little more realistic when it comes out with some of this -
we have cleaned it up .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
it is shameful that they took this opportunity to cross the country and hold their own town hall meetings and then bring the reports back .
we all enjoy our standard of living and the wonderful wealth of this country .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
they do not add up to a fresh vigorous vision or federalist initiative to unite the country for the 21 st century .
i listened carefully to what he had to say .
this was the Minister of Finance , who is sitting just a few desks down , opening the flood gates and making this announcement to the public .
* * *
i have friends on this side of the House who wanted to make application before the travelling board and they did not get an opportunity .
Mr. Mark Muise
QUEBEC PREMIER
in the last Parliament the government made progress in promoting trade both within our borders and beyond through reducing internal trade barriers and using the team Canada approach to open doors to Canadian businesses in Asia .
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett
it does have the possibility of setting a precedent , if not a legal precedent at least a political precedent with respect to how similar issues will be dealt with in other provinces .
Mr. Walt Lastewka
there is considerable evidence that people who cut taxes bring about an attractiveness in a country for people to come and conduct research partly because of lower taxes and strong money for infrastructure .
madam Speaker , Saint - Antoine - des - Laurentides is in the Laurentides riding .
but how many are left today ?
even more remain permanently injured as a result of their work .
standing ORDERS
the hon. government whip has stated that the matter would possibly be brought up in the Board of Internal Economy today .
that is the nonsense of getting into extremes .
a few days prior to the meeting Indian affairs officials learned that members of the Stony band would be attending with the hon. member .
customs
Mr. Randy White :
the Speaker :
Mr. Speaker , the minister ' s answer is simply not good enough .
we have six years before it gets up to the top premium price of 9.9 % .
Mr. Speaker , no .
Mr. Speaker , in accordance with Standing Order 48 , I would like to raise a question of privilege regarding the premature disclosure of a committee report .
they may issue receipts year round for tax credit purposes .
however , I would like to ask the hon. member a question .
there is a point where things can be done .
everyone who can think clearly has to consider the EI overpayments as being simply another tax .
it is obviously to help the finance minister bring down his deficit , but it will be done on the backs of workers and employers .
i think the hon member will realize that was not a point of order .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal
it is very complicated and there are a lot of stakeholders and many positions , as my colleague from Brandon - Souris reported a while ago .
madam Speaker , I want to congratulate you on your appointment to the Chair .
i am honoured and privileged to be in the House of Commons representing the people of Dauphin - Swan River .
it is a big step .
there is nothing in the throne speech which would give Atlantic Canadians , particularly young Atlantic Canadians , any degree of hope .
by breaking up with regions for different gear types we are creating a system where fewer fishers are able to fish for longer periods and be more assured of an income and of a fishery than would otherwise be the case .
it should also be noted that when Bill C - 72 was originally drafted , both the Financial Administration Act and the Canada Business Corporations Act were used as models for various provisions .
i want to assure the minister that we will do all we can to co - operate in his agenda but we are going to be keeping his feet to the fire on these issues .
oh , oh .
Beryl ' s background in municipal government kept her firmly rooted in the community .
supporting innovative companies and building knowledge infrastucture is not enough in itself .
i call on this House and this government to initiate a full , open and federally funded study of the feasibility of developing Donkin as part of a three mine Devco operation prior to any privatization of the site .
Mr. Louis Plamondon
behind the statistics on unemployment and poverty , there is still lots of good news for the area ' s economy .
i would like to tell you that we have hope on this side .
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) :
the hon. member is not talking about all the things that are disappearing .
the commitment of the Government of Canada to adopt its programs to reflect the social economic realities of rural Canada is of particular importance .
on April 29 , 1996 , after encouragement and pressure from the Reform Party , the former minister of justice stated in this House : " Although steps have been made toward progress in recent years , they have been imperfect .
it is rather ironic that the last time my colleague from Winnipeg - Transcona encountered Mr. Fraser was at Mr. Knowles ' funeral back in June .
Mr. Speaker , the amendments proposed in Bill C - 2 are simply not acceptable to the party to which I belong .
for the moment , I can only quote the letter from the minister .
hon. John Manley
in 1996 - 97 , over 376 projects received financial support from this fund , for a total investment in excess of $ 624 million .
i want to inform the hon. member that we have now obtained the two passports used in Jordan .
this session could be different
the World Bank said just recently that some 9.2 percent of the GDP of the OECD countries was spent on public pension plans .
i would like to highlight for members what the results of those consultations were .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
there are .
we worked with others of like mind and showed that Canada can make a real difference in the world .
i suggest to him that the approach and the strategy we have provided allow us to take very serious account of our fiscal reality , of the resources available to us to make sure we do not ever again spend too much , but to reflect the needs of Canadians and make choices that are reflective of Canadian priorities .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
i can certainly understand why he would have to ask that .
before she attends tomorrow ' s meeting with her provincial counterparts , will the minister guarantee to this House that her government will demonstrate federal leadership in protecting endangered species that range or migrate across interprovincial or international borders ?
liberals do like to talk about those issues but the unfortunate thing is they do not like to act very much on them .
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan ( Winnipeg North - St.
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
how did they do that ?
if Canadians want to read this document it is available to them on the Internet at www . Reform . ca / babb .
just how is it that he signed cheques one day and called police the very next day ?
as it happened , yesterday I was at a meeting of the Board of Internal Economy .
i listened for words of concrete action to be taken , for example , to assist students reeling from the burden of student loan debts or for real targets to reduce unemployment and eliminate poverty .
the worst news is that it is not the Prime Minister ' s government or the provincial governments that will suffer .
an hon. member : - like to the Senate .
hon. Andy Scott
the second theme is realizing our international potential .
over 60,000 youths participated in the 1997 student summer job action .
i wish to advise the House that my constituents are delighted with the initiatives of the government with respect to the Canadian unity file .
the reason I say that is because I spoke with my parents the other day .
that is very serious .
is that the model that is ultimately going to be offered ?
increase funding for community - based crime - prevention initiatives to $ 30 million per year ;
Ms. Angela Vautour
there is another difference .
Mr. Speaker , I move :
i remember as a Canadian born in 1960 when I came to this House there was a $ 42 billion deficit .
internship programs have been particularly successful in helping young people get started .
it establishes a corporation to be known as the CPP investment board .
i have a tremendous concern about that .
it was a very pessimistic snapshot of what our country will look like economically in 30 years .
when all their friends are away , I hope they get a chance to think of this one point personally and consider it from a non - partisan point of view .
Mr. Speaker , if you will allow me a very brief moment to respond , I do not know whether or not I responded to heckling from another member .
employment INSURANCE
the Speaker :
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
do they remember that the same people who now sit on the government benches fought us tooth and nail on the free trade agreement ?
Mr. Paul Szabo
the government has provided no information on the adequacy of retirement incomes for Canadians as a result of these changes .
madam Speaker , I will repeat my question since I was interrupted .
are they in the pay of the Mouvement Desjardins ?
health care delivery may be a provincial responsibility but there is no question in my mind that all Canadians hold us , the federal government , responsible for the existence and the quality of our health care system .
i say " once again " because this is not the first time the Liberals have tried to intrude on health care .
i have always accepted the outcome of any vote in this House but between now and then it is very important that we reflect on what is the responsibility of this Chamber .
we will continue these policies .
Mr. Speaker , we do not have people who are trying to hide the truth .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
it is an evolving reflection of who we are as Canadians .
Mr. Speaker , this week is national family week .
we demonstrated in the last Parliament - and we will show it again - that this is an open , transparent government , a government that will listen to the people and will make decisions , often tough decisions , that are needed to continue keeping the country the best country in the world .
( the House divided on the amendment , which was negatived on the following division : )
hybrid Turkeys is Canada ' s only primary breeder of turkeys , one of only three worldwide , exporting over $ 15 million in large white turkey breeding stock to over 40 countries .
allow me to outline the magnitude of this debt .
Mr. Bill Gilmour
hon. St 茅 phane Dion
such a marketing plan would include guaranteed initial payments , however , the guarantee would only cover a maximum of 90 % of any losses incurred .
barely three months had passed before a Surrey doctor facing a hearing for sexual impropriety had the young complainant murdered .
i want to know when it was the government ' s policy to approve conflict of interest sole source contracts that cost the taxpayer a billion dollars .
Mr. Speaker , I would just like to respond to the last remark of my colleague opposite .
our concern is to protect the environment to the highest standards and also allow -
they chose instead to violate the independence and the impartiality of the courts and betray the faith and trust of Canadians .
* * *
these provisions are balanced and fair both ways , for either exclusions or inclusions , and in either case the authority is vested where it belongs , not in politicians but in the hands of farmers themselves .
let me give you a brief overview of the current status of the Canada Pension Plan .
in the Speech from the Throne , they say they want to follow up on this promise of interference .
it does not make sense to ignore that proposal .
that is very significant .
if we destroy the various institutions that farmers in many countries have built to help themselves survive economically , we will have nothing left but producers standing bare among the ruins of structures that once empowered and protected them in a marketplace dominated by giants .
according to the 1,010 people who responded to the Vancouver Sun ' s question , 70 percent said yes , secession should be on the table .

likewise all benefits under the CPP except death benefits will be fully indexed to inflation .
nay .
how about the CBC ?
that is wrong , but it does not seem that the things that he does are wrong .
it being 6.47 p.m. this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
moreover , when the reports will have been submitted for this campaign - I do not have them myself , since they were all completed on October 2 and we have until December 31 - my colleague will be able to see for himself that the Bloc ' s rules apply .
Mrs. Nancy Karetak - Lindell ( Nunavut , Lib . ) :
i know there can be a lot of impatience but let us wait for the answers .
dozens of unity groups sprang up .
this is consistent with investment policies in most public and private pension plans in Canada .
politics is a public rather than a private process .

some of the members who are sitting here , looking at me , received some of those contributions .
i would like him to respond to that , but just one more minute .

Mr. Speaker , there is no doubt about it , Irish eyes are smiling today .
i strongly urge this government to grant their request .
never has a government in a Speech from the Throne so openly questioned Quebec ' s right to decide its future alone .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
certainly , disposal and remanufacturing costs are every bit as real as inventory and transportation costs .
they bent the ears of the provincial governments .
and while I am on the topic , they do not need anyone ' s permission to be distinct .
on April 14 , the then Minister of Transport stated he was quite happy to co - operate with any organization that wished to improve the utilization of Mirabel airport .
the chief justice of the federal court and Judge Jerome ' s administrative superior arranged for Mr. Thompson to meet with him in his chambers to discuss the matter further .

because of the renovations , because of the change and because of the unique situation of having two international airports at Montreal , the government feels that the RCMP should stay there during this period of change .

the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
Mr. Ted White
you are one of the Reform Party members with whom I have had the opportunity to work .
i ask hon. members to be very diligent in their remarks .
through you , Mr. Speaker , I would like to add my comments to those of my colleagues from Calgary Southwest and South Surrey - White Rock - Langley concerning the joint committee to which the proposed amendment to section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 will be referred .
Mr. Speaker , there are two points which must be clarified in the House .
the French fact is an essential part of my identity , one that has nurtured me , one that has given me strength and identity , one that has made me the Canadian I am .
as long as somebody in Ottawa can tell us what to do in western Canada it is accountability and it is democracy .
he has a franchise with the hotel chain but the builder and owner have nothing to do with the Auberge des Gouverneurs .
it does not care about the essence of government . Government is for the people .
some hon. members :
when one is in favour of something , and has very little time , there is no point in arguing the point further , but I would like , as the member for L 茅 vis , to -
Mr. Bryon Wilfert ( Oak Ridges , Lib . ) :
earlier today I talked about spending some money , and I am proud of it .
in each of these four provinces , section 93 has been replaced by a section which restricts the provincial government ' s ability to prejudicially affect denomination schools at least as much as section 93 would have done had section 93 applied to that province .
one of the major issues which we need to address in the House , which my fellow New Democrats and I will raise , is the issue of fair taxation .
there is a bidding war .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Rick Laliberte ( Churchill River , NDP ) :
in fact , this was such a contentious issue during negotiations with the provinces that the agreement , which was supposed to be reached in 1996 , was only announced in 1997 by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Human Resources Development .
the hon. member for North Vancouver has asked that the bill be passed at all stages by unanimous consent today .
Mr. Paul Bonwick :
the board bought grain from farmers at similar prices and under similar conditions .
and if you get caught , nothing happens .
it is an honour for me to be in this rather august Chamber representing the great riding of Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke .
i want to thank my staff , Dianne , Mohammed , Dan , and Tanis for their work in the constituency office and the Hill office prior to , during and after the election to ensure that we serve our constituency and our country well .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te
while it is most unlikely that any member in this House of Commons or in any legislature or jurisdiction would stand in his place with a piece of paper and quote from a piece of paper on which there is nothing written , it has happened in the past .
those who have read the throne speech will know that it builds on the tremendous accomplishments of the last Parliament .
at the formal signing ceremony in Ottawa this December , we do expect other countries beyond the 90 who have already rallied to the cause to join and to help perhaps to educate by their own positive example the numerically small but still important and also politically disparate groups of holdout states .
it was so melodious , it could almost be compared to a symphony orchestra .

Conestoga College has 30 years of service to the community and a graduate job placement rate close to 90 percent .

Mr. Peter MacKay
the Reform Party does not care about the essence of politics .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Calgary Southwest , Ref. ) :
they have the ability to paint a picture which they believe in but which I do not think it is quite accurate .
he said it in this House some moments ago .
i do not know what the member ' s affiliation was when he was living in New Zealand .
last February , in full pre - election mode , the Liberals , with their sense of the dramatic , announced with much fanfare the creation of the Canadian Foundation for Innovation .
i have had occasion to meet with the authority in Saint John .
that is part of our consultation .
no matter how beneficial another proposed constitutional amendment may be , it is extremely unlikely that the Parti Quebecois government would ever endorse it .
canada is also helping to draw the countries of Asia - Pacific closer together , a region which includes the world ' s fastest growing economies .
Mr. Speaker , I think that it is sort of a tradition for one ' s maiden speech to concentrate a bit more on local affairs .
now we really have a balance .

over and above science , medicine and politics , human cloning is also a question of human dignity , which transcends all partisan politics .
i encourage the hon. member and any other member in the House that if they have suggestions how I may hear from a greater number of Canadians , I would be happy to hear from them .
Mr. Lorne Nystrom
i found myself on the opposite side of the issue .
if you apply , you get the money , taxpayers ' money , money from ordinary Canadian families .
this is not an academic debate .
the member for Markham indicates that sacrifices have been made to eliminate the deficit .
in the review of what I talked about yesterday it is critical to understand that the legislation which started 30 years ago needed some upgrading to be brought into the reality of today ' s society .

RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
i cannot understand why the government will not move and support the will of the majority in areas as simple as removing section 745 from the Criminal Code , the faint hope clause that gives special rights and advantages to killers in this country , and on the other hand punishes innocent people in this country .
clause 5.1 states that the $ 55 million agreement will be managed by two members of a management committee , one member appointed by the federal minister and the other appointed by the provincial minister .
under an existing ministerial directive , any person over the age of 55 who is unable to perform the duties of his or her own job can be declared disabled .
young OFFENDERS ACT
this is a reform which was necessary .
i believe the CEO form of governance is a good direction this government has taken .
the Atlantic vision conference will feature sharing , collaboration and consensus building .
it is a serious offence .
i would like to remind the hon. member opposite that several members on this side have risen to point out to the government what the priorities of Quebec are in the area of occupational or manpower training .
this will remain unchanged in both Canada and Quebec .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe
i would also like to express thankfulness to the constituents of Kelowna who saw fit to re - elect me , giving me the opportunity to represent them in this House .
i think he is trying to say that the Reform Party does not agree that the government ought to have such a program ; that the Reform Party does not believe we ought to be assisting high tech companies , small and medium size companies to go forth and produce products which can be sold in Canada and throughout the world .
tobacco ACT
our plan will lift Atlantic Canada up in terms of the economics of the country to the level of the other provinces .
speech FROM THE THRONE
Mr. R 茅 jean Lefebvre
how is it that , with a Parti Quebecois government , in Montreal there is high unemployment , poverty is on the rise and prosperity is a thing of the past ?
suffice it to say for now that we are opposed to this bill because it erodes the public pension system and the universality of that system .
Ms. Marlene Jennings :
they are shutting down the democratic process .
this choice will change totally and utterly the relationship between the federal and provincial governments .
i know that is a novel theme in this government .
there was no acknowledgement in the throne speech that in the past the government has been routinely chided , not only by watchdogs like the Reform Party and the Canadian Taxpayers Federation , but even by the auditor general on many occasions for irresponsible spending .

the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia ) :
younger Canadians , those of the generation after me , will receive some 57 垄 in benefits for every dollar they pay into the plan that the government is proposing .
Mr. Speaker , we have always stressed the necessity of recognizing the distinct character of Quebec because of its language , its culture , and its Civil Code .
when there is a preamble in legislation it is usually a political smoke screen which comes out of the department that writes the legislation , usually the Department of Justice .
yet we waited for three months before he notified us of what was going on within his department .
Mr. Speaker , I could not do that because it would not be true .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
yet this government has let the environment disappear from the national agenda .
Mr. Speaker , I will try to respond .
this is not the first time I have risen in this new Parliament , but this is my first speech .
Mr. Speaker , the health minister seems willing to accept this feeble excuse that the file was accessed to go after federal court document information .
his brothers and their families shared that home .

the hon. member for Charlotte on a point of order .
it means that Canadians who are in the unfortunate situation of having had a stroke or who are otherwise unable to earn an income can receive a disability benefit from the Canada pension plan .
hon. David Kilgour
the recent problems with the premature failure of the Candu reactor and disclosure of the problems within Ontario Hydro by its employees and the people who run the reactors should certainly give government pause for concern over that program .
we want to have small and medium size businesses develop and commercialize new technology .
Mr. Speaker , the proof of this government ' s integrity lies in the fact that the person who requested an investigation by the RCMP was our colleague the Minister of Human Resources Development .
European leaders are actively debating global warming strategies .

together with the council and the Department of Justice , my department is targeting prevention programs where they are needed and will have the greatest impact .

the Speaker :
foreign AFFAIRS
in the middle of the national unity debate the federal government is telling us that its policy for the north is still one of downsizing and budget cuts and not one of a truly human relationship between the government and its people .
and there is more .
environment
as I said in my speech , Canadians want a balanced approach .
it is always the Liberal approach to care and be responsible to others .
Mr. Speaker , I have already answered this question in the House .
no longer will we pass on present problems to future generations of Canadians .
Mr. Chuck Cadman :
Mr. Speaker , I wish to express to my hon. colleague from Longueuil that when it comes to issues such as the environment , suicide and pay equity she can be assured that I and my colleagues will assist her in any way we can in order to get the necessary funding and the help required in order to meet those needs .
i believe we can better achieve our objectives as stated in the throne speech by assuring , as the hon. member for Hillsborough had argued in his remarks , that greater power is put in the hands of the members of House of Commons .
in my opinion , the system works .
i shall consult with them and will continue to use my best judgment at all times taking the collective interests of our constituency and our country as my guidepost .
certainly a critic has an innate responsibility to be responsible in their comments .
i am concerned when they talk about partnerships , because government partnerships mean that somebody is left out of the partnership .

Fergus among other things is noted for its architectural beauty which is surpassed only by its natural beauty located as it is on the Grand River watershed .
Mr. Speaker , yesterday , the Minister of Human Resources Development stated that he had warned the RCMP and the Prime Minister ' s Office last spring of serious allegations concerning a Liberal Party of Canada fund raiser .
we have done that .
therefore , the reform we are talking about today in this House concern Quebeckers only in an indirect way .
it is now backing away from an earlier promise to protect endangered species that range or migrate across international boundaries , such as the swift fox and the eastern cougar .
David Crane of the Toronto Star commented : " The announcement of higher premiums for the Canada pension plan should reassure Canadians on the long term viability of the plan to which all workers contribute '' .
third , the retirement age remains unchanged .
Mr. Monte Solberg
if they collect from 65 until 75 , should they live to 75 , they will only get $ 88,000 out of that plan .
this is a very minor first step and I introduced a private member ' s bill specific to this .
it is said that Canada finds strength in diversity .
there has been an increase in the last two years in farming income , certainly in our area .
business OF THE HOUSE
the government is always a step behind .
this is the root cause of the deadlock .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
yet the government is content to smother small business , which is the real engine of job creation , with excessive tax rates .
the parents of students of the linguistic minority in question will sit on these councils .
there are tens of thousands of profitable businesses and corporations that pay not a dime in taxes .
the Speaker :
once again , we are sort of enlarging on the whole question .
Mr. Nelson Riis :
if the government is to continue its efforts to put its fiscal house in order , and we agree it should , there has to be debate , since the past four years have shown us only too clearly how completely lacking in compassion this government is .
since we speak about the rule of law , 1982 is the rule of law in this country and I am very happy about that .
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib . ) :
first , Canadians are saying that they want a public pension system .
as I said before , as soon as they have presented these resolutions , a similar resolution will be put before this House , and then we will discuss -
when we talk to people around the country , and I am talking of all members in the House , I think that there is probably a consensus that the federal government should direct its spending toward issues that are important to Canadians , issues like health care .
i hope that this leadership will be followed by the provinces .
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) :
please do not ask us to trust the government .
we discussed the famous Liberal code of conduct on several occasions in this House .
we will see once again that those constitutional remedies have been exhausted .
as his hon. leader said , it is the final frontier .
some of our younger people are worried that the premiums are going up , but everything is not absolute in history .
we should all look with hope at the possibilities that lie within the Calgary declaration .
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) :
Mr. Peter Adams
this also has spread right across the country and we celebrate that because that is the only way we will be able to work our way out of the terrible debt situations we have all found ourselves in .
we chose job creation , investment and financial credibility instead of playing the same old record .
this should be an exciting time for the people of Quebec and all across Canada who are looking for fundamental changes to our federation .
committees OF THE WHOLE
but we now know - we can no longer forget - that in the provinces , such as Quebec , structures have already been planned for the strategic development of local areas .
he would let me stay up past my scheduled bedtime , but only if I watched the evening news with him and answered questions about what I had observed , to which he often offered the right political spin .
these are the people who keep democracy strong in this country and who make it possible for people of limited means to seek office and to serve in Parliament .
in other words , people will pay in some cases $ 3,300 a year for 47 years if they happen to be self - employed , and at the end of that time they will get a measly pension of $ 8,800 , and that is the best case scenario .
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
the budget is to be balanced in 1998 - 99 , a truly remarkable achievement that has earned the admiration of the world community .
all of this while publicly demanding Canadian content and diversity in programming .
Mr. Andr 茅 Harvey
the standards applied for public fundraising must be given proper scrutiny .
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
we now have the lowest interest rates in 35 years .
that is not what Canadians have told their governments over the consultation period .
i have never been informed of any such request by any government .
nobody has yet found a way to run a country without them , but it is the rates established in Canada that need serious adjustment .
not only does Federal Express get special treatment at the border , but Revenue Canada employees are actually going on temporary leave to work at this private company .
if the hon. member wants me to look up the word " bamboozle '' , I will be happy to do that .
he is a dangerous sexual offender .
more than $ 1 billion in Canada student loans helped about 300,000 Canadian students go to college or university this year .
the difficulty I see in my riding is that I talk to elderly people who are having to sell their homes because of clawbacks .

we should therefore be careful not to make hasty comparisons with Newfoundland .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
the expertise of both is required : those who know the value of the grain , sell the value of the grain , work with people abroad , work with all the intricacies of transportation and everything the board is responsible for ; and those who represent the primary producers .
Mr. Speaker , this is a major concern .
so the people who voted for us supported the general principles of that party platform .
Mr. Speaker , I too would like to offer either my congratulations or my condolences to you .
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
what change was there in Quebec ?
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT
we actually think that an election campaign is when Canadians should be consulted .
this has also been the case with many young offenders joy riding after stealing a car and encountering police pursuits .
we are also looking out for those in our society who find themselves in the middle ages , sometimes victims of structural change .
it has always been a source of disappointment to me that so few Canadians seem to appreciate or are aware of their history .
this is the position of the Reform Party and the opposition .
Mr. John Maloney
* * *
i have been surprised and overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and innovation present in our public service and their clear commitment to real partnerships .
we will find this in history .
about the equality of individuals , I do not have any lessons to receive from the hon. member for Edmonton North because I was the minister of justice who gave the charter of rights to all citizens of Canada to make them equal .
to get back to the bill , in compliance with the law , changes to the Canada pension plan must be approved by at least two thirds of the provinces representing two thirds of the country ' s population .
the Liberal Party is an affront to small business .
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
the hon. member should always address his question to the Chair .
Mr. Bob Mills
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
by the way , where was all the talk of partnership back then , this great notion of rediscovered partnership ?
clearly there are more Canadians going back to work .
throughout its 62 - year history the board has been an agent of the crown answerable solely to the Government of Canada and governed by a small group of up to five commissioners .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
it is essential to our democratic system that controversial issues should be debated at reasonable length so that every reasonable opportunity shall be available to hear the arguments pro and con and that reasonable delaying tactics should be permissible to enable opponents of a measure to enlist public support for their point of view .
it seems as though the minister and the prime minister are quite content to put the burden of trying to fix decades of mismanagement on the backs of another group unable to pay , young workers .
this is provincial jurisdiction over education , clear and simple .
over 50 % of the farmers want some choice .
i lend the voice of our party in support of the motion that has been brought forward .
members
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
we will continue to fight in parliament for taxpayers as long as we are here .
these terms imply a will to live together , and the hon. member for Bourassa is aware of these issues .
Mr. Svend J . Robinson
when will the Bloc Quebecois respect the voice of democracy , even in response to an unclear question ?
i am also sure that many Canadians will agree that the proposed changes will harm their retirement years .
the federal Liberal government is firmly committed to a publicly administered comprehensive health care system that provides universal access to high quality care to Canadians everywhere .
i assure them that I will continue to discharge my duties and responsibilities as their member of Parliament with the same dutiful and careful attention I have served the people in the past .
this image of the Atlantic provinces is totally unacceptable .
i would have hoped that we could turn the page on the post - Meech period and finally start building a national , a Canadian action plan .
second , society may have to assume higher costs later on as a direct consequence of the failure to invest in the early years .
if and when the federal government decides , through the heritage department , to provide financial support to the establishment of a network of health care services in French , this network will be managed by the Montfort hospital to fulfill the mandate given to it by the Ontario health care restructuring committee .
in Atlantic Canada we are not talking about handouts ; we are talking about strategic investment into the area of the country that has the greatest amount of unemployment .
to ensure the future of the Canada pension plan for all Canadians , last February the federal and provincial governments agreed on changes to the plan to ensure its long term financial viability , while making it more fair and more affordable for future generations .
each province will have its own method of consultation .
Mr. Speaker , it is the hon. member whose concern is politics .
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅
in her presentation , the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre argued that the privileges of the House have been breached in so far as the preliminary draft report has been divulged prior to its presentation to this House .
Mr. Speaker , we all argue that it is better to vote for your party than to vote for another party .
the Speaker :
but I do share the member ' s concerns .
QUEBEC ECONOMY
in Quebec , we have respect for democracy .
am I not right , Madam Speaker ?
honor 茅 Mercier went down in Quebec history as a man who asked Quebecers to set their partisan divisions aside .
the automotive industry employs directly or indirectly approximately half of working Ontarians .
canada would then be responsible for the " disposition " of the spent fuel .
i left the best for the last , the west .
members are talking about a $ 100 billion fund .
they used to be the majority , but now not even 25 per cent of the population of this country speaks French .
is it true that the term " Canadian " is inclusive and the term " Quebecer " exclusive , and that , accordingly , Canadians are a people and Quebecers a society ?
the Liberals plan to fix the CPP will be a further $ 11 billion tax hike on working Canadians and employers if the government refuses to reduce the EI premiums .
i am not making this up .
no wonder Canadians think the government cannot add .
Mr. Rick Borotsik
establishing the Nunavut territory is my priority as Nunavut ' s member of Parliament , but it must also be a priority of this House .
we heard that over and over again .
there are different interpretations of the royal commission ' s report on aboriginal peoples .

i do hope the PQ government will use this money to help the most disadvantaged in Quebec .
there were Thompsons , there were Jeffersons , in our history , and we know very well they had a hand in building the province of Quebec , the country of Quebec , and we acknowledge their special role .
we had over 200 amendments and we were not able to obtain the services from legislative counsel because of the overload they were experiencing .
i have always felt that my environment , my way of being , my education , my language , which make up my culture , make me a Quebecker .
i believe and I am sure many members of this House will agree that the government ' s plan is an attempt to move forward to the past .
let me tell you one thing : if we want a united Canada , if we want to remain a united country , westerners will have to support easterners .
under their plan the gap between the rich and the poor will widen , not narrow .
there is all this talk of rebalancing the federation .
i thank the hon. member for North Vancouver for his comments .
hon. Lucienne Robillard
when they die their children and their spouse will inherit the capital .
contributions to the Canada pension plan are a component of Canadians savings toward pensions .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne
we know that the government reaffirmed its commitment to spend 50 percent of any surpluses , when they occur , on new spending .
in 1947 the exclusion act was repealed and Canadians of Chinese ancestry won their right to be reunited with their families .
but let us just quickly talk about those .
the goal of that process was to determine how best to revitalize and modernize the operations of the Canadian Wheat Board .

to add to this , it had virtually no agreement with the provinces or territories with regard to implementation or compliance .
( members were issued ballots and marked their ballots in secret at voting stations )
it suggests the conciliation process was never intended to resolve the major issues and is tantamount to denying the postal workers their legal right to strike .
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , today the auditor general released his report .
that this House condemn the government for making their 50 / 50 election promise on any future surpluses without adequate public debate as to the optimal size of government , taxes , and debt , thus threatening to repeat Canada ' s 27 year old history of irresponsible spending , creating high debt , financed by high taxes , causing high unemployment .

the hon. member for Cumberland - Colchester also expressed an interest in the tendering process for the highway .
now the Liberals are cutting off debate after only seven hours .
Mr. Speaker , first let me extend my sincere congratulations on your election .
when I was in Iqaluit , the future capital of Nunavut , it was mentioned that Canadians are as ill - informed about their north as Americans are about Canada .
oh , a reasonable facsimile thereof .
in 1995 mining , energy and forestry contributed a combined total of $ 91.6 billion to Canada ' s GDP which constituted over 13.5 percent of Canada ' s total GDP .
Mr. Speaker , I would like to clarify the issue here .
it should be voluntary participation in the Canadian Wheat Board like every other industry .
in addition to the special honours that he received at that time from the House , from the government and from the Canadian people in a massive overwhelming way , we have a tradition in this place of paying tribute to former members .
Mr. Speaker , if this was not so silly it would be -

Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand
Mr. Speaker , I listened very intently to the comments of the hon. member .
i look forward to the member ' s supporting our proposals .
tax is not the correct word .
as is customary in a maiden speech I would like to take this opportunity to recognize my predecessor , a man who quietly and effectively went about his work , a man whose actions demonstrated not only the political knowledge to differentiate between right and left but also a clear and fundamental understanding of the difference between right and wrong .
Mr. Speaker , this is an investigation that implicates the Liberal Party of Canada , implicates ministers and goes right to the heart of the matter of government integrity .
it makes it more difficult to qualify for disability benefits and imposes stricter rules for combining disability and survivor benefits .
the Minister of Heritage had , moreover , made a commitment to present a plan in support of the magazine publishing industry as soon as Parliament reconvened .
let me ask the question to the Minister of Finance .
the city ' s exporting capabilities are second to none thanks in large part to its proximity to the United States and its strategic location along the St. Mary ' s River .
Bre - X was a disaster as far as a stock is concerned .
what is the record of the Liberal government that its members all applauded ?
it was a good economic engine for the small community and the region I come from .
bill C - 2 is a good illustration of the government ' s tired thinking , lack of imagination and unwillingness to look at new and better options .
pay EQUITY
the question is what to do about the other three tires .
it has an important role in making legislation better .
can the member please advise the House , if he is going to protect everything that is there already , how does he propose to save the Canada pension plan ?
if they have not actually seen these passports , how in the world does anyone from the government know they are forged ?
it should be going to farmers and asking what they really want .
is the hon. member willing to look at concrete reforms of federal institutions so that all Canadians feel included and can share in the kind of magnificent patriotism expressed by this member ?
the fourth principle is that of reform , pushing to develop new policies in keeping with changing times .
thank you very much .
i emphasize the impact on those who are disabled .
they keep on repeating this and it has worked .
what if Quebec were to become an exporter of any of these products ?
we are talking about a plan that is almost $ 600 billion underfunded .
Mr. Bob Speller ( Haldimand - Norfolk - Brant , Lib . ) :
we must accept the value of dissent and daring and savour courageous controversy as a hallmark to courageous change .
something else in this speech from the throne struck me ; I was quite shaken by it .
this means that in 1998 - 99 the provinces will receive $ 700 million more than is currently budgeted .
the bill will open crown corporations to the public and make them accountable .

the Speaker :
MIRABEL AIRPORT
it is incumbent on this government to take the message which was given to it on June 2 and respond to the needs of Atlantic Canada .
Mr. Dick Proctor
the Speaker :
the Reform Party would target seniors benefits so that people on the low end of the income scale would get more through the seniors benefit .
it is my sincere hope students of knowledge based technologies will be the primary benefactors .
that is one the public wants to see , for better or for worse , reflected in the House .
( members were issued ballots and marked their ballots in secret at voting stations . )
there are approximately two years ' worth of benefits in the CPP at the present time .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur
i think the Chair will need to consider two issues .
one of the reasons given by the province of Newfoundland for changing its entire separate school system was that it wanted to save $ 9 million to $ 11 million .
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , if I understand correctly , there were two minutes remaining to me before the interruptions .
he was here in the House and signed the agreement implementing the HST .
accordingly the CPP will move from a pay as you go financing system to fuller funding to build up substantially larger reserve of funds .
we should all recognize outright that education and training are provincial jurisdictions but the Prime Minister happens to have some control .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
when we look for instance at the initiatives related to the centres of excellence to deepen our understanding of children ' s development and well - being and to improve our ability to respond to their needs , these are good programs which will contribute significantly to the well - being of young Canadians .
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) :
let us also remember that these tax and spend Liberals are not as compassionate as they like to appear .
i said there certainly was room for government spending on such things as education , research and health care .
i do not think so .
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) :
these benefits I have had are not things that I want my generation to not give to the people following us .

hon. Don Boudria
they are concerned that by ratifying and implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child that government bureaucrats and the courts , not parents , will be legally entitled to determine what is in the best interests of the child .
i ask the House to listen to these words from J . S . Woodsworth ' s first speech to the House 75 years ago .
right now , the provinces have decided to consult their citizens before adopting their resolution .
this is not a personal attack , but a collective one .
hon. Allan Rock
since the government ' s first election to office in 1993 , we have made public safety a priority for action .
yet I would not be honest if I did not admit that I agree with one point which passed virtually unnoticed in the torrent of words in the throne speech .
Mr. Corbeil , who was referred to earlier , is an organizer for the Liberal Party of Canada .
my father is under palliative care .
and as we progress , we must never lessen our vigilance .
( official Version )
agreed .
that this House consider the business of supply at its next sitting .
nobody could say that the Swiss are not smart , that their country does not have a high standard of living and that they do not conduct themselves in a civilized manner , but the difference there is that those people who want input to the government truly have input .
some suggestions may indeed be hard to assign .
Ms. Karen Redman :
someday we will shape a federation that is attractive enough for the discontented who say they want to separate to want to stay be fulfilled , lest they are left behind our dynamic and yet diverse society .
prior to 1987 disabled coverage was available to those who had contributed for at least five of the last 10 years .
you cannot take someone who has committed a murder , and is seriously off the rails , incarcerate them in a youth detention centre for five or six years and expect to get them turned around .
QUEBEC PREMIER
the government and all the members in the House would do well to remember the words of the Right Hon. Robert Stanfield , a fellow Nova Scotian .
while his point may have been one that he feels he should make in this way , I am sure he knows it is wrong to perhaps over - dramatize things by tearing up books and so on in the course of his speech .
hon. Allan Rock
however , with regard to the present Liberal Party , I remember how in 1993 it ran on a platform almost exclusively dedicated to government ethics , claiming it was going to change the way things were done , and so on and so forth .
when is he going to get it ?
governments at all levels are becoming more mindful of this new imperative in the conduct of their business .
what has changed ?
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
that on Wednesday , September 24 , 1997 , the House shall continue to sit until the leaders of all recognized parties have spoken in the debate on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne and that immediately thereafter adjourn to the next sitting day .
this gives me , the Bloc members and all members from Quebec here an opportunity to appreciate the extent of the vision of the political leaders , those who were working with them at the time - and I would mention Jacques Parizeau at the top of the list - in giving Quebec an instrument that ensured the people of Quebec the best return on their pensions and that provided for economic growth .
the fact of the matter is that Canada has the second highest rate of incarceration in the western world .
the CRTC stated that the earliest it would accept an application was June , but it made a special exception and accepted an application in February from long distance carrier Teleglobe ' s Look TV .
you have to appreciate the spectacle of the Prime Minister and the Liberal benches rising during question period to applaud the government on its brilliant record .
RCMP INVESTIGATIONS
those who argue in favour of closing the generation gap will have to hurry up and , as we intend to do in committee , take a critical look at the provisions of this bill and try to improve it .
supreme COURT OF CANADA
the people of Cape Breton sent a strong message to this government on June 2 .
in a situation where it is mandatory to belong to the Canadian Wheat Board this contingency fund is another tax at a time when farmers cannot afford any more input costs .
his bureaucrat parents named him manpower and immigration , but their own rules made his first name politically incorrect so they changed it to citizenship and immigration .
but if we do not respond to the moderate spokesmen of Indian Canada , there is a danger they will be displaced by the less patient and more militant leaders .

( h ) Foreign Affairs and International Trade ( sixteen Members ) ;
they were concerned about the government directly investing it and giving money back to the provinces .
during the election campaign the Liberal government promised a national pharmacare program but obviously had no idea of how it could or would be funded .
some people would look at that as a compliment and other people would look at it in another way .
where is the fairness in that ?
a majority of the provinces , including Ontario , representing a significant majority of the population of Canada , have signed an agreement to make changes to the Canada pension plan that will solve the problem .
what we have done is avert a crisis and we are doing it responsibly .
Mr. Paul Forseth ( New Westminster - Coquitlam - Burnaby , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am deeply honoured , as I rise today in humility , to present a few remarks on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne .
there is a role not only for private business but there is a role specifically for government to be involved in solving these problems .
DIAND officials were unsure of the legal implications of releasing the information under these circumstances or the rights of a financial advisor to receive such information .
as stated in the Speech from the Throne , the government will increase funding for community based crime prevention initiatives to $ 30 million a year .
this best country in the world is behaving like an imperial power looking down its nose at its ignorant colony , which dared to get just a little too uppity on the evening of October 30 , 1995 .
some hon. members :
that is a very conservative estimate .
Mr. Speaker , I know that Canada is a country known for respecting all the different nationalities that come to it .
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I received a disturbing phone call this week regarding a seasonal worker who worked his hours in a 12 - week period , qualified for EI , but because of the new legislation having included a 26 - week period for calculation of the claim , this man is asked to live on a $ 39 a week paycheque .
the system does work .
it is prepared to impose a 10 % payroll tax on all Canadians so they can get a whopping pension of $ 8,800 -
why on earth did he ever become a Liberal ?
there are also major renovations under way at Dorval .

the concept should be changed by marrying it to the principle of equality and making crystal clear that any recognition of uniqueness in Quebec or elsewhere , a uniqueness that we applaud , will not confer on one province powers not conferred on another .
as I look across the floor I can see who is responsible for the increase in poverty .
one was on an amendment proposed by a member on this side of the House .

Mr. Speaker , today I recognize a company in my riding of Scarborough Centre that has had major successes in the international trade community .
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , once again , the opposition party is naming people who , so far as I know , have not been charged with anything .
Quebecers are not interested .
if I am wrong , I will correct myself .
Mr. John Finlay ( Oxford , Lib . ) :
reformers and people with different perspectives from many countries have shown over and over that this philosophy is both wasteful and ineffective .
Mr. Speaker , I would also like to add a few words with respect to the point of privilege raised by the member from the New Democratic Party .
Mr. Preston Manning
a reading of the bill raises some questions .
we will be able to go into our communities and ask our citizens for their input .
for example , last November our government introduced legislation to modernize the Canada Labour Code .
that speaks volumes about the ability of the government to take a terrible financial situation and put in place the kinds of safeguards that will ensure prosperity not only for this generation but for generations to come .
hon. David M. Collenette
it will be by working together and helping each other that we will accomplish the task .
* * *
the Deputy Speaker :
the study was done by the Boston Consulting Group .
we read in the Speech from the Throne that the government , and I quote " will provide increased support to the Canada Council '' .
certainly that is a better return than that suggested by the Reform Party under the super RRSP given the fact that its administration costs are going to be the lowest of any pension plan in the country .
if she can put up with the prime minister for 40 years I guess we can put up with him for another four .
in the conduct of that work I had encounters with this official .
at that time the judge said it was an awful crime .
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅 ( L 茅 vis , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , this year the International Whirlpool Bridge that links Canada and the U.S. celebrated its 100 th anniversary .
we also have to bring down Canada ' s debt as a share of our economy .
i will remind my distinguished colleague that the Liberal Party , which ran the country from 1970 to 1984 , except for the nine months of Joe Clark ' s government , managed to make the accumulated deficit grow to $ 250 billion .
such behaviour is odious and absolutely hypocritical , particularly when it is at the expense of the least advantaged and the sick .
what happened to all that tough talk ?
as we point out in our paper , a balanced budget law would be an important first step in reassuring Canadians from coast to coast that the painful tax increases and reductions in the social safety net that were made necessary by previous governments will never occur again .
this government cannot claim ignorance to these facts .
these documents will be distributed to the members of the standing committees to facilitate their consideration of the spending authority requested in part II.
Canadians believe in the State of Israel and its right to defend itself against attack .
Mr. Preston Manning
whether there has been wrongdoing or not will be determined after the police has conducted its investigation .
we are already extending our team Canada approach to help Canadian businesses prepare at home to compete and win in international markets .
there is a constitution , which we did not sign for all sorts of reason , but the first - and I would propose to the Leader of the Opposition that I give him for Christmas a book written by an intellectual by the name of Mandel of the University of Toronto , who proves the point clearly .
we simply indicated that it was unsatisfactory to a government wishing for competition in a very important sector to have the CRTC decide how many companies could compete in it .
Mr. Speaker , it is very sad when a leader of an opposition party makes fun of a difficult problem .
Canadians have seen them and I understand that it is clear that they are forged but we have been asked to make certain that they are forged .
this is why I call upon the solidarity of older people , of those already covered by the existing plan .
this mandate holds little hope for tax relief .
Mr. Speaker , I thank the minister for her response .
there is plenty of evidence out there among ordinary average Canadian taxpayers that they are very dissatisfied with any suggestion that government would increase its spending at this point in the cycle .
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate our new colleague on his election and I am surprised , as well as happy , to learn that he is here because of the 1995 referendum .
many of us know from previous experience that all too often there is insufficient time for each member to probe the issues with questions to the witnesses .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien
that obligation is to our country .
restrictions on foreign content hinder diversification in a host of investment opportunities required to minimize financial risk .
individuals must contribute '' .
i too want to acknowledge Rod Murphy and all of his help .
what is the Prime Minister going to do to remove the cloud of suspicion that now hangs around the transitional jobs program ?
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member .
i heard the Leader of the Opposition say that they have fixed one of the flat tires on the car .
it comprises the city of Anjou and several areas of Montreal , including the fast growing district of Rivi 猫 re - des - Prairies .
we made commitments at Rio in 1992 to try to achieve reductions by the year 2000 .
those words were spoken almost 35 years ago by our current prime minister .
some hon. members :
to me that is a metaphor for what we are as a nation , what we have been as a nation and what we can be as a nation .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
in a similar way , our government has led important initiatives in agriculture .
there was absolutely no acknowledgement in the throne speech that we have the highest taxes of all of our trading partners , the highest personal income taxes in the G - 7 by a tremendous amount .
madam Speaker , it will be imperative in the next chapter for us to reinvest in medical research , science and technology .
just imagine that , a bunch of politicians and government appointed patronage hacks controlling the largest investment fund in Canadian history .
when people do not have money to spend businesses do not sell .
in many ways the experience of my first week in this House of Commons seems very far removed from the sometimes harsh realities of life in east Vancouver .
all these areas must be addressed without jeopardizing how far our government has come in getting our fiscal house in order .
we are facing up to the demographic realities by securing the future of the CPP .
i do not know who she is referring to .
the challenge for us as parliamentarians from across this great land is to ensure that we continue to build a country that celebrates the diversity which unites us in our resolve to maintain our nation as a model for the rest of the world .
Canadians will receive an annual statement which will show how the Canada pension plan is progressing .
i appreciate that .
hon. David M. Collenette

i will continue to uphold their rights as staunchly as I have in the past .
what financial incentives do we offer Canadians who are self - employed or who are considering self - employment ?
how could the House regard the government ' s claim to be accountable as anything other than a big fish story ?
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
this separatist member , who is well known for putting her foot in her mouth , said last week , and I quote " As a French Canadian , I am a second class citizen '' .
we all remember Stanley ' s lifelong battle for decent pensions for working people .
Mr. Mauril B 茅 langer ( Ottawa - Vanier , Lib . ) :
when an incident takes place anywhere in the world and Canadians are at risk I believe that the government should do what it can to help them .
can the Conservatives ?
why is it that before we sit down to negotiate we first threaten separation ?
it worked quite well .
we have also doubled the annual limit of contributions to the RESPs to $ 4,000 so that young families can put more money aside for their children ' s future .
what did it mean to Quebeckers to have a charter of rights and freedoms ?
are you agreed ?
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is obviously misinformed if she believes that the government has not been applying the law .
perhaps this will help bring the issue home for people who have trouble dealing with an astronomical number like $ 600 billion or even $ 47 billion in interest .
on the prairies today grain piles up in the elevators , trains sit idle on their sidings and government monopolies continue to tell farmers what to do with the products of their labour .
most of us have young people in our family - I have five children - who are working if they are fortunate enough to find work .
to reconcile the dilemma that the continued support in Quebec for sovereignty , however diminished as the polls suggest , is a personal goal and one that contributed greatly to my decision to run for Parliament .

we believe on major amendments that the test should be conducted through a referendum .
i would like to ask the member from the NDP a question .
Mr. Jason Kenney

government ORDERS
madam Speaker , the member talks about me doing this as a violin playing matter .
i do not know if this word is in Beauchesne ' s or not , but sometimes it is the tone used with the word and sometimes it is circumstance , that causes disorder , etc.
committees OF THE HOUSE
in addition to his honoured name we all remember his qualities of integrity , compassion and devotion , in particular toward the interests of Canada ' s veterans .
Canadian firms will be able to expand into emerging markets with higher quality products at lower prices because of , not in spite of , sustainable practices .
Mr. Speaker , how does the minister intend to meet her responsibilities in the future , when only yesterday she announced that staff will continue to be cut in her department ?
in the mining industry this is unacceptable as time is of the essence because of the volatility of the markets .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
it is important that these questions be answered .
foreign AFFAIRS
the Liberal government has spent close to a million dollars cancelling a helicopter purchase , which it now admits it will have to go through with anyway .
i recall all kinds of ads where the prime minister was sitting down to coffee and suggesting that things were wonderful with him , but I really do not recall those ads about the 50 percent .
if that is what he wants , let him stand up and declare it to everybody , including his constituents .
the provincial government had divided Thornhill .
we say this specifically after the recognition of peace officers which took place yesterday .
Mr. Speaker , I want to indicate that this is my maiden speech in the House .
i am always entertained to hear members opposite talk with such great passion about the future and youth .
i would conclude by asking -
and the House being returned to the Commons chamber :
as we set out at the beginning of this new Parliament perhaps it would be best to remember Stanley Knowles as a politician , a political warrior who was armed with the strongest armour that any of us can have , a writ of election and a seat in the House of Commons of Canada .
artists and arts organizations will play a major role in determining how Canadians see themselves in 20 years .
i also want to thank my friends among the hearing impaired whom it is always a pleasure to meet .
although the idea of a renewed federalism holds out promise and a future for Quebec , there are those who will oppose it because they do not believe that Quebec can or should be an equal partner in the Canadian federation .
i would like to pay tribute to the sustainable development promoters and supporters of the country , to the people concerned with international co - operation , and to the business people who I rubbed shoulders with in my career lives .
how many people have to be unemployed and living in poverty before the hon. member and his party get it ?
introduction and first reading
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
Mr. Tom Wappel ( Scarborough Southwest , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 225 , an act to amend the Marriage ( Prohibited Degrees ) Act and the Interpretation Act .
these new challenges will replace the old divisions , allowing both Canada and Quebec to understand and appreciate each other .
Mr. Speaker , applications are made for the riding of Saint - Maurice just as they are for the riding of Sherbrooke and all the other ridings .
it is my firm belief that we are capable of giving , of taking risks , of finding the just solution .
since when is it okay for party officials to have their fingers in awarding government contracts ?
the hon. member will be aware that we have recalled our ambassador to Israel for consultations .
clearly Canadians are creating businesses and , though not very often , are even pocketing some money and prospering .
with my colleague , the minister of health of Saskatchewan , I am co - chairing a conference in January of next year which will bring together provincial ministers and other interested parties to look at all aspects of this issue .

some hon. members :
funding for initiatives such as breast cancer , HIV and AIDS and tobacco reduction are key elements in the prevention strategy .
resumption of debate on Address in Reply
Mr. Speaker , it is very difficult to have the same kind of process in Quebec as in the other provinces since the Premier of Quebec is not interested in consulting the people of Quebec about the Calgary declaration .
madam Speaker , members have been speaking about the 1982 patriation of the Constitution for the last few minutes .
despite language , race or religion the day to day concerns of Canadians are the same from coast to coast to coast : family , employment and the economy .
we have not lost that much time .
health
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member , but I must give the floor to the hon. member for Scarborough - Rouge River .
Ms. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or , NDP ) :
after this Canadian miracle , as economists around the world refer to this unprecedented success , it is totally insulting and inexcusable that the member for Medicine Hat can pretend it never happened .
the Prime Minister .
i would also like to remind the leader of the Reform Party that he need not look for a flawed democracy where it does not exist .
the member referred to the unemployment fund .
the Presiding Officer ( Mr. Caccia ) :
once again , this is put in the form of a question and of course it is one of the questions that this House has asked me to take into consideration and which will be taken into consideration .
in my own constituency I have made it a practice to hold regular , broadly based , very visible community forums .
the Reform Party uses the word tax .
Mr. John Reynolds
this is a national social program , an income security plan which is very rarely before the House , very rarely debated , very rarely amended .
one of the core characteristics of Cape Bretoners is our penchant to speak the truth .
i am very proud of the government ' s economic record .
Mr. Mark Muise

Canadians are optimistic .
madam Speaker , I am pleased and honoured again to reintroduce this bill which would establish a registered charitable trust fund for the benefit of families of police officers , firefighters or other public safety officers who are killed in the line of duty .
you have one goal and one goal only and that is to destroy this country .
the port is being used now after it was sold to an American company .
we should not only be pleased that the debate is entering a new stage today but also that a majority of Quebeckers , francophones and anglophones , support the establishment of linguistic school boards .
Mr. Speaker , the member brought up really good questions and I thank him very much for that .
Mr. John Harvard
i am reluctant to do so with such an experienced member , but I feel in the circumstances I should draw the rules to his attention .
our export trade is dominated by a few large corporations who are interested in buying low and selling high to enhance the earnings of their owners , who are not generally the same people .
i need to refer to those notes .
but I can reassure the member that , when it comes to current events , he has before him a minister who did his duty by informing the RCMP minutes after learning of certain allegations .
i would first like to congratulate you , Mr. Speaker , on your position as Acting Speaker .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :

the municipal government - and I have spoken with the mayor of Vancouver about it - the provincial government and the federal government must , as we are , work in co - ordination to provide social services , proper policing and treatment to those very much in need .
one aspect of the jobs strategy is to target youth employment .
in addition , Industry Canada and foreign affairs have established an active networks of trained executives across the country , those people who can assist small businesses , in fact any businesses , whether home business or even large businesses , in export .

Mrs. Elsie Wayne
i just want to comment that I as well look forward to keeping this government in check in particular in the area of justice and these atrocities , some of which the hon. member has mentioned , areas such as the Krever report and the Airbus scandal .
that right of these parents to educate their children in the way they want to educate their children in my view is a sacred right and it should not be interfered with .
i thank the hon. member for bringing that up .
democracy goes right out the window .
members and senators on the committee should be asking themselves and asking the representatives of the Quebec government , does the proposed Quebec constitutional amendment prejudicially affect in any way the rights of those who desire a religious orientation in the education of their children ?
hon. Hedy Fry
Mr. Jim Pankiw
i know her question is a serious one on agriculture .
but those people will find that they will continue to have their benefits fully indexed so their pension income will not erode .
it is not only personal income tax .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will .
- transport , Votes 1 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 and 40

Mr. Cochrane , like many other CESO advisers who work as Canadian volunteer advisers to business and assist business and organizations in Canada ' s aboriginal communities , developing nations and emerging market economies in central and eastern Europe .
Mr. Speaker , I have a question for the hon. member who has just finished speaking .
of course , that is a matter of debate right across the country .
Mr. Speaker , the federal government is currently very engaged in preparing for the Kyoto agenda in December .
this bill is a very important piece of legislation .
he found that it was harmonious and elevated and had vision .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
* * *
the increase in CPP premiums from 5.6 percent in 1996 to 9.9 percent in the year 2003 is not only a tax hike , it is a tax hike of monumental proportions , the biggest single tax hike in Canada ' s history .
* * *
Mr. Speaker , I wish to table a petition from citizens across Canada who are concerned about national unity .

older Canadians have earned the right to a secure retirement .
the loss of markets that we suffer each time there is a work disruption is an immeasurable commodity .
let me say that this reform motion is wrong and it is misguided .
that is hypocrisy .

Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question .
Mr. Speaker , at the onset I congratulate you on your well earned appointment .
i could not know on March 4 things that I found out on March 5 , the very day I called the police in .
the issue is that we are asking our ambassador to come back from Israel to discuss the matter .
i am not privy to the negotiations that took place between the provinces and the federal government .
this was in accordance with the increases in election expenses of all political parties and of the Chief Electoral Officer in his statutory reports for 1979 , 1980 and 1983 .
this is a section of the Constitution providing for exclusive provincial jurisdiction over education , subject to certain provisions pertaining to the protection of minority rights .
they have called for monstrous tax cuts in personal income tax , in business income tax , and in terms of getting rid of the increase in Canada pension plan premiums .
they want democracy .
since the system provides for the RCMP to inform the solicitor general , how can he stand up and tell us , as he did yesterday , that he was not informed ?
Mr. Speaker , I am rising on a point of order with respect to this issue .
Mr. Bernard Bigras :
Mr. Speaker , when the Minister of Finance tabled his bill to amend the Canada pension plan last February , he claimed to have guaranteed the future of the three pillars of our retirement income system .
that is the state of affairs in this country .
what did the Minister of Finance tell us back then ?
what is a death benefit ?
we must find ways for young Canadians to learn what they share , to know what we have done and to gain pride in their nation ' s accomplishments .
for many years , the Government of Quebec and the other governments complained that we were involved in areas they would rather see us out of .
trade
members
what more does Lucien Bouchard need to hear to put an end to such a costly threat to our economy ?
he knows full well that in the last budget taxes were reduced by over $ 2 billion .
maybe before the member makes an accusation he should speak to his own ad manager in the last election campaign .

statements BY MEMBERS
how can I walk through my riding and tell constituents on Grands - Ducs Street in Stoneham , Vaillancourt Street in St - 脡 mile or Mathieu Boulevard in Charlesbourg that federal politics is completely clean , as provincial politics is in Quebec ?
during her active practice of nursing in the Yukon Territory she also founded the Yukon Native Arts , a lifeskills program for native youth .
i must make a comment regarding the order of speakers today .
that is what we call freedom .
the member also asked about tax reform .
i can think of a lot of people in my community who would say that is nice , but do we really want our disposable income reduced by that kind of expenditure .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. John Williams
the government will provide enhanced funding for student summer placements .
