Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is in response to the widespread interest in this subject , in the constituent power , the constitutional amending power not only in Quebec but also in other parts of the country , that I rise to speak in this debate .
chapter 5 of the Constitution Act of 1982 established , as it was intended , an all Canadian base for constitutional amendment in place of the pre - existing made - in - Britain style of constitutional amendment .
we are still working out the precedents or the ground rules regarding how that should operate .
our working out of the ground rules is influenced in considerable part by practice and there is already some practice , but also rules of good sense and good federalism .
in the case of Newfoundland , we have looked at this issue twice .
in the case of Quebec , we have here a resolution passed by unanimous vote of the provincial legislature .
this is not the first time that this issue has been raised in Quebec .
in fact , if I can take members back in history , I remember examining this issue professionally a quarter of a century ago when the issue was the language in Quebec ; the issue of an official language , the language of work and the language of education .
members will recall that this issue was entrusted to a royal commission of the Quebec government , la commission sur la situation de la langue fran 莽 aise et les droits linguistiques 脿 Quebec , which reported in 1972 , the Commission Gendron .
one of the proposals considered by the commission was simply how to apply the issue of language of education having regard in Quebec to the existence and operation of section 93 of the then British North America Act of 1867 , the Constitution Act .
the issue raised then was whether it could be done because we did not have the 1982 Constitution Act nor these all - Canadian self - operating amending machineries .
the suggestion which was advanced , which I think is an interesting one , was that it could be achieved by ordinary legislation .
the key is of course in the words of section 93 which are rooted in 19 th century history and , to some extent of course , in 18 th century history because that is where these particular provisions flowed from , the capitulations of 1759 , the Treaty of Paris of 1763 and the Quebec Act of 1774 .
the essence of these provisions , however , is that they do not in terms guarantee , or even necessarily in the spirit , the continuance for all time of a system of religiously based determination of allocation of children to the school system .
this is a gloss which has emerged in some minds because of a lack of reading of the provisions of section 93 and also because of a static , mechanical and unimaginative approach to constitutions and constitutional interpretation .
constitutions are not fixed once and for all in time as frozen cakes of doctrine that cannot stand the test of progressive generic interpretation .
constitutions , as the Privy Council reminded us , are living trees that grow with the times .
it was on this basis that the issue was examined , whether section 93 could allow a replacement of a religious based classification and allocation of students by a language based one .
i think an interesting answer then was , yes .
however , this is a different situation now because we have the 1982 Constitution Act in effect and the 1982 Constitution Act allows for amendment of the Constitution under various categories .
one of the interesting things here is that we are applying section 43 of the 1982 Constitution Act to the amendment of section 93 of the Constitution Act of 1867 .
the essence of section 43 is that it allows for a bilateral process of amendment of the constitution on the initiative of a single province and with the concurrence of the federal government .
the effect of course of this as a matter of constitutional application is that a constitutional amendment so adopted is limited in its constitutional force to the particular , one might say , consenting province and no more .
insofar as section 93 is amended by section 43 , it is a Quebec - only amendment .
one interesting point in the particular amendment , and why it achieves much of what was discussed as a theoretical concept by the Gendron commission in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s , is that it leaves open the effectuation of the principles of the capitulations of 1759 , the Treaty of Paris , the Quebec Act and section 93 .
it leaves open the issue of effectuation of those principles again by other legislative provisions .
in the debate on Newfoundland amendment term 17 , which is a special case in that it is limited to term 17 of the Act of Union , 1949 , between Newfoundland and Canada , there were some interesting exchanges across the House .
we should stress that often the truth is found in these exchanges .
it is a dialectical give and take .
unlike a number of other countries including Great Britain , there is no official state religion in Canada .
the system is neutral on that point .
however , unlike the United States there is no constitutional separation of church and state .
therefore it is perfectly open for any province in Canada to introduce its own system of religious instruction or provision of religious facilities in school education .
it may be limited by provincial charters of rights as to which we would remind ourselves that Quebec has certainly a most impressive Quebec provincial charter of rights .
it would be open within the political processes of any province to provide a form of religious instruction .
that is a matter for the provincial political processes .
it is left open under both the Newfoundland amendment and the Quebec amendment .
let me come back to the particular issue .
if the approach to section 93 had been its removal altogether , it would have required clearly 7 out of 10 provincial legislatures to assent to it .
since the Parliament of Canada is being approached under section 43 of the Constitution , not section 38 ( 1 ) which is the larger provision I just mentioned , it requires the assent only of the Quebec legislature and the Parliament of Canada .
it is very clear that the constitutional amendment now proposed is limited by virtue of the constitutional amendment route chosen to Quebec and the Parliament of Canada so far as it operates in this respect in Quebec .
we have an approach to constitutional amendment that is limited to Quebec , that follows upon the unanimous vote of the Quebec legislature and that does not according to ordinary rules of interpretation offend the Quebec charter of rights or our own constitutional charter of rights .
that is in accord with the expressed opinion of Quebec persons who testified before various parliamentary groups that it changes a burdensome system of administration which is excessively costly and no longer corresponds to widespread Quebec views as to classification and categorization of students and education .
if the Gendron commission had adopted a proposal in 1972 to replace the religious based categorization by language based categorization , there would have possibly been a situation somewhat like the present situation .
instead , in developing French as the language of education in Quebec compatibly with rights of minorities , it superimposes a very cumbersome system of language approach to education on a church based system , an immense proliferation of administrative authorities .
the nearest analogy I can find is the Belgian approach to the solution of the linguistic problem , which is an administrative constitutional nightmare .
on the basis that this is a request , freely made by the legislature of Quebec with a unanimous vote preceding it , an issue considered for over more than a quarter of a century in Quebec on which a consensus has clearly emerged , there is no reason in principle why following good principles of federalism the federal Parliament can or should refuse the particular request .
in my view it could have been met by interpretation of section 93 without an amendment , but since we have the Constitution Act , 1982 , it is proper that it should follow that particular route .
the answer is that it has no implications for that at all .
it is open to the political processes within the province .
my expectation , since Canada is a plural country , is that individual provinces will answer differently .
there is widespread interest throughout Canada in new , more plural approaches to education .
it is very clear the financial burden of education is spread unevenly and in many respects unfairly over many taxpayers and the correction should come at the provincial level .
that is a legitimate issue of concern for provincial voters and each province will make its own decision .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , congratulations on your elevation to the chair .
i commend the learned and honourable member for his presentation .
he is a distinguished constitutional authority and an asset to this place as such an authority .
i would however take issue with some of his conclusions .
the hon. member suggested the amendment would not create a precedent for other provinces .
i agree this will not create a legal or constitutional precedent but it will create a political precedent .
it is for that reason organizations such as the Canadian Catholic School Trustees Association , the Ontario Catholic School Trustees Association and dissentient separate school boards across the country are opposed to the amendment .
i have several questions for the hon. member in that respect .
he said the matter had been considered for nearly 30 years in Quebec .
given that virtually every witness before the committee agreed the amendment to section 93 is a relatively recent proposal , what evidence does he have to support the contention that it has been considered for 30 years ?
what does he mean when he says there is now a movement toward " new , more plural approaches to education ? "
does he mean by that approaches to education which preclude confessional education ?
does he mean more secular approaches to education ?
does he not agree this is a very real threat of removing the constitutional protection of section 93 , that the charter poses the ultimate threat to the confessional school system which Quebeckers still support , by a very large margin ?
Mr. Ted McWhinney :
madam Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his thoughtful series of questions .
there were very learned studies .
since I also taught in Quebec over a period of five years including at one French language university , it was very much a subject of discussion .
although it may appear strange outside Quebec , as something new and different , it has been very much a part of Quebec thinking .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
section 93 .
Mr. Ted McWhinney :
section 93 has to be considered by any commission or any group considering language and education as the criterion for allocation of students .
the second issue the hon. member raised has implications essentially for other provinces .
he raised the issue of what I referred to as new plural trends in education .
every province obviously is different from the other .
this is one of the nice things about Canada today .
i would think that there are more indications outside Quebec and outside Ontario of experimentation with religion and education and religious based schools .
the thing that is becoming interesting is the suggestion that it should be accompanied by at least partial funding from state , from public authority .
my point was simply that there is nothing in the constitution that prevents that .
we do not have the absolute separation of church and state that they have in the United States which positively prevents that .
i taught constitutional law in the United States and it was a constitutional absolute , the absolute separation .
it even chased out of the American school system voluntary religious classes given on the school premises outside school times .
there was a series of decisions in the fifties , sixties and seventies .
this is perhaps a correct judgment by the United States supreme court of the American ethos but it is not necessarily applicable in Canada .
one issue at the core of the third question of the hon. member was the issue of the courts and the constitution .
i would be the last to say I am always happy with the development of the jurisprudence of courts .
when the charter of rights was adopted I suggested to the then prime minister that a logical concomitant of the change to a charter based system of constitutional jurisprudence was reform of the supreme court .
i and some others recommended unsuccessfully the establishment of a special constitutional court with the European system of election of judges for a term of years .
the European courts have a strong cross - section of political and general philosophical opinion on the courts .
i do not think it is a necessary consequence of the role of the courts today , even under the system that now exists , that they apply American jurisprudence .
mechanically applied , I think those would be wrong decisions .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
they are precedents .
Mr. Ted McWhinney :
precedents can be changed because perhaps they have not been argued well enough .
you must not be too optimistic about the level of constitutional argument that we -
the Deputy Speaker :
the hon. member should address the Chair .
Mr. Ted McWhinney :
Mr. Speaker , I would be the last person to ignore the Chair consciously and the last person to ignore the Chair when it is occupied by its very distinguished present incumbent .
you fill the role admirably in a very real corporeal sense .
however , I would encourage the hon. member who has shown that he has a litigious attitude in areas other than what we are now discussing not to give up hope on the court .
he should try right reason , try his arguments and argue the new pluralism and he might find he can win .
but it is certainly an incorrect application of the Canadian charter to assume that American judgments in the area of the charter of freedoms are automatically the law of the land here .
we are a different society .
i would have thought the great charm of our society is that we are a plural society .
we have rejected the melting pot concept of total assimilation .
we encourage diversity .
we try to build co - operation based on those integral elements that each culture has and this demands a jurisprudence that reflects that .
i rest optimistic that with future education by this House including by the hon. member that the courts will move more in this direction .
i do not think they have shown the imagination they could have .
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris - Moose Mountain , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for the recollections as he went historically through what has brought us up to where we are today .
i must commend him because I appreciated it .
it was like sitting at university again and scribbling down some notes .
i am not here to quarrel with anything said by the hon. gentleman .
historically I believe he is most accurate .
if there were a way , if the charter could do it , for the sake of the rest of the provinces I would encourage the member with his wisdom , knowledge and background to lend more support to that .
let us not tear away at something the rest of the provinces feel is valuable .
Mr. Ted McWhinney :
Mr. Speaker , as I mentioned , it would have been possible in 1968 and 1970 - before 1982 - to try to reach the same result by interpretation to demonstrate that the particular measure proposed is compatible as legislation with section 93 as fairly read in its general intent and purpose .
but once you replace the old British style of constitution amending process by the charter of rights , the ordinary principles of federalism say that you follow that route .
i can reassure the hon. member on this point .
i have made a point in my interventions on the Newfoundland school issue and on this issue today of stating that this is an amendment limited to Quebec and that in voting on this issue I do so on the basis that it is limited to Quebec .
the member may ask me what the relevance of that is .
a constitutional interpretation by courts , the decisions of Parliament , the travaux pr 茅 paratoires , carry their own authority .
if the member himself or other members would like to indicate that in voting on this issue their vote is given on the basis that this is an amendment that applies to Quebec and only Quebec , that itself carries heavy artillery with it .
it is something that in my view a court would be unwise to try to overrule .
as far as other provinces are concerned , my recommendation to them is to fight it out within the new political processes .
there are no constitutional barriers other than the charter of rights which on this issue is not pre - emptive .
the interesting thing I cited for the last hon. member who questioned me is there is a mood for re - examination of education .
there is a feeling that too much uniformity or a monolithic approach to education is not the best thing for suiting our children for the next century .
therefore the new pluralism , the new ways , including the possibility of public aid , partial at least to new schools trying new approaches , would include religious schools .
this is very much a matter that individual provinces can and should be able to reach within ordinary political processes .
i say to the hon. member and others that if this is your view , indicate that you wish your vote on this to be an issue limited to a constitutional amendment affecting Quebec just , as more strictly , for the one in Newfoundland .
Mr. Peter Goldring ( Edmonton East , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on this motion to amend section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 concerning the Quebec school system .
i feel , however , that amendment is understating the issue .
it is in fact an extinguishment of sections 93 , 1 to 4 , for Quebec .
as a freshman member of Parliament , a member of the class of '97 , I am particularly honoured to be speaking on such an important subject as amending the Canadian constitution .
such weighty matters have a tendency to give members of Parliament an exaggerated sense of their own importance .
they can start to see themselves in terms of their own place in history .
amending the constitution is a serious exercise , one that should not be done lightly or in haste .
in Canada it is something not done with ease .
it took Canada 115 years to bring home the British North America Act and create a Canadian constitution that could be amended at home .
lest we forget , the clock is still running on its ratification by the province of Quebec .
here we are in 1997 , 130 years since Confederation , and the process has still not been completed .
that is not such a bad thing .
there are countries in the world which have gone through a dozen constitutions in the same amount of time .
they tend to be places where such documents are often not worth the paper on which they are printed .
in Canada our constitutional process seems to move at a pace that we could describe as glacial .
we have a document of which we all can be proud , a statement of our individual and collective rights and responsibilities .
it represents a careful balancing of individual rights and collective responsibility to protect the rights of minorities .
as such it is an important part of our identity as a caring and compassionate people .
i have good reason to be concerned when the government of the day pulls out all the stops to accelerate the constitutional process .
i have good reason to be uncomfortable when the amendment in question is being proposed by a provincial government that has not ratified the constitution .
i have good reason to seek greater clarity on the process when there are legitimate questions being asked about the legality of the amending process being used .
i have good reason to listen carefully to thousands of Quebeckers who asked us not to ratify the amendment .
there are times when the glacial pace of constitutional change makes sense .
i find it worrisome that the Liberal members of the special joint committee from the other place , who are required to provide sober second thought , would be in such a hurry .
as a member of the special joint committee , I have listened closely to the witnesses who have appeared before the committee .
i have considered carefully the opinions and views they have expressed and those expressed by the hundreds of people who have written letters and signed petitions on the subject .
they stem from a simple test consisting of three questions .
first , does the constitutional amendment have the democratic agreement of the people ?
second , does it conform to the rule of the law ?
third , are the rights of minorities protected ?
on the first the answer is quite clear .
there has been no public consultation in Quebec .
in contrast to Newfoundland , which is also pursuing constitutional reform with regard to its educational system , there has been no referendum .
unanimous consent to a request for the school board amendment by the Quebec national assembly does not in turn reflect unanimous consent by the people of Quebec .
the hundreds and thousands of Quebeckers who signed petitions opposing this amendment are proof of that .
i cite as an example the petition of the coalition for denominational schools , a petition signed by 235,000 people .
it is shameful that some members of the government have been questioning the validity of this petition .
the people of Quebec who signed this petition cannot be ignored because they demonstrate that there is no consensus in Quebec for an amendment to section 93 of the 1967 constitution .
the solution to this is reasonably straightforward .
it needs to present clearly the implications of the amendment .
i would not doubt that greater understanding would reduce the level of distrust and fear .
among other avenues , the Government of Quebec could have had its ministers involved in the process earlier rather than relying on quiet passage .
the answer to the second question of whether it conforms to the rule of law is less straightforward .
the committee should be certain that what is being proposed respects the rule of law .
are we using the appropriate amending formula ?
the Government of Canada and some legal scholars say yes .
other voices have challenged the bilateral process .
the committee should not be expected to decide this question in haste under an artificial deadline .
i would like to point out that the ink is not even dry on this motion and I have been made aware of a court challenge already .
this court challenge asserts that the legislature of Quebec and the Parliament of Canada do not have the authority , acting pursuant to the bilateral amendment procedure foreseen by section 43 of the Constitution Act , 1982 , to proceed to amend section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 by repealing subsections 93 ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) as they apply to Quebec .
the petitioners assert that they have persons directly concerned by the repeal of section 93 and invoke their individual right to and interest in the integrity of the process to amend section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 .
a court decision could settle the legal issue .
without such a decision , the committee should at least have received a full legal brief on the issue so it could consider the matter in the light of the best legal advice available .
the answer to the third question is crucial .
the question of minority rights has been at the soul of Canada for its entire history and the rights of minorities to control their own education have been established in province after province .
how well a country protects its citizens from the tyranny of the majority is a measure of its democracy .
i think we all can be proud of how far we have progressed since the Manitoba schools debate of 100 years ago .
when the dividing line is language , emotions tend to run high .
this is one reason why the protections in the constitution are so clear about the education rights of linguistic minorities .
of course , this brings to mind one concern .
it is not clear that the Government of Quebec believes section 23 to be in force in that province , as that province has not ratified the constitution .
the Government of Quebec wants an amendment to Canada ' s constitution so that Quebec can rearrange its school board system from one based on religious denomination to one based on language .
although there does seem to be a consensus for linguistic school boards , there is equally a strong voice contending that rights to have religious schools would be violated with the abolition of the denominational school provisions in section 93 .
Quebec wants to change the school board structure next year once the existing guarantees for Protestant and Catholic boards in Montreal and Quebec City are removed .
many people would agree that boards organized along denominational lines may not make a lot of sense .
they only need to look a little farther west to the province of Ontario to see a system where boards organized along both linguistic and denominational lines seem to work .
is it not strange how much more sense things make the farther west we go ?
the guarantees provided are far from perfect , but unless they are replaced by some other form of constitutional protection removing them would erode the education rights of the English speaking minority .
the move to linguistic boards should not be used to weaken minority rights .
does the amendment risk leaving Quebec ' s English minority with less protection than it has now ?
i think it does and I am not alone .
to sum up , I asked three questions .
i was hoping for three yes answers but I received two noes and a maybe .
it was hardly a passing grade .
let me be more generous and propose an easier question .
what harm would be done if the amendment were not passed by the House today ?
the children of Quebec would still receive an education .
the circumstances that have prevailed for 130 years would prevail a few more and the sky would not fall .
about the worst thing that can be said about the clause in section 93 is that it is anachronistic and inconvenient .
it is unfortunate the constitutional chess game and the government ' s strategy of appeasement will continue .
let me be clear .
returning the process of constitutional change to its normal pace does not mean that change is not possible .
let me make it clear that the Reform Party supports the appropriate use of the amending formula if it is supported by an expression of the will of the people .
the constitutional process has to come out of the back rooms and the realm of the power brokers and deal makers .
surely we learned this from Meech and Charlottetown .
there is nothing stopping a reconsideration of the amendment in a few months time under only slightly different conditions .
let me suggest the following to the Government of Quebec to improve its chances next time around .
it can consult its citizens .
it can hold a referendum with a clearly worded question .
it can state clearly in writing that minority protections of section 23 are in place .
may I suggest that the easiest way of doing that would be to ratify the Constitution of Canada .
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I have , as you can imagine , listened carefully to the speech by the hon. colleague from the Reform Party .
i can see , without any ill will , that our colleague is obviously very ignorant of the Quebec reality .
it would have been interesting if he had been able to come in person for a visit to Quebec , because the understanding he has could be compared to a Flintstone style of understanding , that is to say a pretty basic one .
i have three pieces of information I want to give him .
the first is that the hon. colleague should know that the debate in Quebec is a longstanding one , not a recent development but one that goes back to the early 1960 s .
in other words , when he was still quite young , the debate was already going on in Quebec on the necessity to reorganize the school system on a linguistic basis .
if the hon. member wants to count heads , he can look at the list I have already tabled at the parliamentary committee .
all the groups that voiced their opinions on Bill 109 which , as you know , only dealt with the establishment of linguistic school boards , also came to Ottawa to be heard .
therefore , my first comment is that the hon. member should be much more careful when he is suggesting that no consultations took place .
second , I realize the hon. member is a new member here , but it takes some nerve to say he is worried about guarantees for the minority .
so , the hon. member , whose party is the only one in this House with no members from Quebec - and this will not change in the foreseeable future - is worried about how Quebec ' s English - speaking minority is treated .
we should remind the hon. member that , in Quebec , it is possible for anglophones to go to English schools from kindergarten to university , to have access to education services in English , to have control over their own mass media - newspapers , radio , television - and to have access to health services in English .
myself and all Bloc Quebecois members would not have it any other way .
the hon. member should be pleased to see how Quebec has so generously , and for so many years , been treating its English - speaking minority .
and it will continue to do so .
no Bloc Quebecois member thinks it should be otherwise .
why , as we are about to enter the new millennium , should we specifically provide preferential treatment for Catholics and Protestants ?
i agree that it is positive discrimination , but it is still discriminatory .
to the extent that we are a law - abiding society - and the hon. member alluded to this several times - we have two charters : the Canadian charter and the Quebec charter .
both of them include the right to freedom of religion .
while in 1867 Quebec was a relatively monolithic society as regards religion , it is no longer the case now .
there are 108 cultural communities in Montreal which profess religions other than Catholicism or Protestantism .
by passing the resolution - and I hope it will be passed despite the Reform Party ' s opposition - we will pave the way for greater pluralism in the public forum that schools represent .
i therefore ask the member why this kind of discrimination he is urging us to perpetuate should be maintained .
second , I ask him if he will agree that the treatment of the anglophone minority in Quebec is exemplary , that we are giving him every guarantee that as far as we are concerned , as members of the Bloc Quebecois , we wish this to continue .
i urge him to be extremely careful when he talks of the petition , because that is not what the majority of Quebeckers want .
this is what the polls and consultations show and I would remind the member that we have been discussing this issue since 1963 .
the member would do well to improve his knowledge of Quebec , and I would be pleased to serve as his guide , perhaps even his spiritual guide , whenever he would like to meet with concerned groups .
it would be my great pleasure to show him the situation in Quebec , because I regret to say that his understanding is based on stereotypes .
Mr. Peter Goldring :
madam Speaker , I will answer a couple of the hon. member ' s concerns .
Flintstone , maybe , but I believe one thing that has not been addressed quite properly is that the request to amend the constitution is really an extinguishment of sections 1 to 4 .
having been in the construction industry for years I always believed that we should build on to our constitution , moulding and improving it , not ripping it down .
that is the direction that should be taken .
certainly sections 1 to 4 need some improvement to better represent today ' s society in Quebec and in other parts of Canada , but I do not believe the way to do that is by extinguishing it and removing it for all time .
i believe we can make those improvements to the constitution .
let me speak to the consensus reached at the meetings .
out of 60 groups represented , eight of them were contained in the one group which represented two million people .
they had not polled their members .
i agree the question of reform in the education system has been going on for 30 years , but there has not been a discussion about removing section 93 to do it .
there has been a discussion on reforming the education system along linguistic lines .
there has not been a discussion of extinguishing sections 1 to 4 of the constitution .
that has been a very recent phenomenon .
it is not well understood by a large number of Quebeckers that the intent of the motion is to remove these rights .
there is consensus for reforming the school system along linguistic lines , but I do not believe there is consensus for the method proposed , which is to extinguish the constitution to get to that end .
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , my question is for my colleague in the Reform Party .
they keep making comments and I simply cannot wait to rise and make certain comments and ask questions .
first , I take discussion of a matter such as this seriously .
the Reform Party is suggesting that it is the separatists who want this .
i find this a bit offensive .
does this mean the bishops of Quebec are separatists ?
does this mean that priests or Pentecostal pastors are separatists as well ?
i think that there is consensus among religions , and it must not be forgotten that this was a minority of minorities .
the Anglican religion , or those religions , were in agreement .
so perhaps it was their minority that was against .
i would just like to ask him this question :
is the Reform Party not afraid of a referendum when it comes to minorities ?
what would happen if there were a referendum in Quebec on the school issue and 80 % of people wanted a change , but a 20 % minority did not ?
would they go along with the 20 % ?
Mr. Peter Goldring :
it was in favour of reforming schools along linguistic lines .
that is the consensus in Quebec .
there is no doubt about it .
there is no question that in Quebec there is a strong consensus to reform the educational system along linguistic school lines .
one group the committee heard from had a membership of 235,000 French Catholics who were against it .
some 50 % of the number of applicants on the application were against school reform by extinguishing the constitution .
therefore , there is strong feeling that there is not full consensus for proceeding in that manner .
when I see the signatures of 235,000 people I really have a feeling that perhaps the people of Quebec should be asked this question directly , not through their associations .
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , this is a debate on a complex issue for those of us who have not had the benefit of 30 years of debate in Quebec .
i must admit that for the first time since my election in 1993 , I am at a point in the debate , this close to a vote , and I really do not know yet whether I am in the yea or nay position .
i would just like to clarify an impression that has been coming from the last few speakers , that the Reform Party is opposed to this .
that is not actually correct .
the decision has been made by our caucus that we will be voting the way we determine to be the best option .
as a consequence , this has become one of the most interesting debates in the House in the last four years .
i have paid a lot of attention to the speakers today and there are a lot of reasons for my indecision .
i would just like to go through them .
the first speaker today for Reform actually presented a very good argument in favour of the change and made it quite clear that he would be voting for this .
later in the day there were some very good arguments against that from other colleagues in the Reform Party .
however , for me there are several key issues here .
the first one is the issue of provincial responsibility .
the text of section 93 begins : " In and for each province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to education '' .
when I look at Reform policy on this issue , it is very clear .
reform policy states clearly that we believe that the provinces should have more powers and we support very strongly the idea that education should be a domain of the province .
to me that is a point that is very much in favour of supporting this amendment because I have no business as a federal legislator interfering in the business of the province .
it is my feeling that if there are problems at the provincial level which need addressing , it is up to the people of the province to deal with that with their own government , to have marches in the streets , to have the protests , to take the court challenges .
as my colleague has mentioned , there is already a court challenge under way .
that is the responsibility of the people to challenge the government closest to them .
to me that is a very powerful argument in favour .
second is one against .
reform policy says that for changes that affect the fabric of our society , things that are major changes , we truly believe they should be subjected to the democratic process of referendum .
members may know that I am the direct democracy critic for the Reform Party and I therefore take a lot of interest in these issues and study the direct democracy questions .
i am a firm believer in this .
i would feel a lot more comfortable if the situation had been , indeed , submitted to a referendum .
it is that section 93 really applies only to Montreal and Quebec City .
if there was this tremendous objection to what was going on , why was I not being bombarded with letters such as I got from Newfoundland about the situation there ?
i was really puzzled by this .
it was clarified for me by the member for Portneuf because he explained that the people outside of Montreal and Quebec City are covered under the provincial legislation and do very well , thank you .
in fact , in his riding which is predominantly Catholic , very close to 100 % , there is still a Protestant school there which is protected by provincial legislation .
even my colleague from Edmonton East conceded that perhaps the provincial legislation is a better model but his concern is that is not entrenched in a constitutional form and therefore is subject to possible change .
the member for Portneuf in my discussion with him says that this has been around since 1867 , so we have to have some faith that it will be there .
again , that brings us back full circle again to this argument about provincial involvement and whether or not the people of the province should have to deal with that issue with their own provincial government and that we should not be interfering in that aspect of it .
as I mentioned , I appreciated the eloquent arguments from members of my own side .
the member for Calgary Southeast made wonderfully eloquent arguments , but I have also appreciated the eloquence from some members of the Bloc on this issue .
i could hear the frustration also in their voices as they were frustrated to hear that some Reform members were speaking in opposition to this .
i hope that what I am saying is helping to clarify why some are against and some are for without getting too emotionally involved in this .
as I mentioned , my colleague from Edmonton East revealed that there is a court challenge already under way for what is happening here and I am very supportive of that .
as I said , the people of the province should be involved in dealing with this if they feel they have been wronged .
at the moment the evidence to me as a member of Parliament is that the majority do not feel they have been wronged .
i have the confidence that if it were to go to a referendum it would pass handily based on the information I have gathered this afternoon .
a member from the NDP made the point that this change is affecting the minorities .
i think that seems to be what is happening here and the larger part of the minority if we can call it that is actually quite happy with the changes that are being proposed .
it is kind of ironic in a way , though , that we find ourselves in this position that the Reform Party is doing all the arguments in favour of minorities when we have always been labelled as this anti - minority party and we are the only ones who are arguing that way in this debate , which is quite interesting .
notwithstanding that fact I think that may be the wrong approach .
i have said over and over that at the provincial level that should be resolved , not in this place .
my tendency is to lean toward voting for this amendment but I will listen to the remaining debates before we actually get to the vote .
the only other point that I did want to mention here is that in the minister ' s speech in October on this issue he mentioned that he felt there was good consensus .
actually I was a bit disturbed by his words because it was not very firm .
it was more that he feels that there is probably consensus .
but in light of other discussions that I have had today , as I mentioned , I think it probably would pass in a referendum .
i look forward to having that clarified perhaps by subsequent speakers who come from the Quebec area .
i guess that is all I have to say on the issue .
i will listen with interest to the rest of the debate and hopefully will have made up my mind by tomorrow .
i certainly never abstained from a vote in this House and I hate to think that I would be put in that position by the time the vote comes tomorrow afternoon .
Mr. Nick Discepola ( Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I was almost angered by what the hon. member for Edmonton East had to say despite the fact that he has been on the joint committee with us for two full weeks .
i was surprised , because I finally understood why the Reform Party is not comfortable with the amendment .
it still confuses minority language rights with the amendment to clause 93 of the Constitution on which we will vote tomorrow and which concerns only denominational rights .
reformers seem to give much weight to a petition signed by 235,000 people .
i even asked in committee how many persons on that petition were from Quebec . I could not get an answer .
the fact that there has been a debate going on for 30 years in Quebec does not strike them .
the fact that Anglican and Catholic bishops supported the resolution has no effect on them .
even the fact that there was a unanimous vote at the National Assembly , where we find democratically elected members , does not trouble them .
since they seem so difficult to convince , I will try one last time to remind the Reform Party members what we will be asked to vote on tomorrow .
they must know that clause 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 does not in any way protect school board structures as such .
minority language rights are not protected under clause 93 .
they are protected by other sections in the Constitution , more particularly section 23 .
section 93 guarantees only two things : the right of dissent for the Catholic or Protestant minority and certain rights for Protestant and Catholic minorities , as the previous speaker clearly explained , not on Montreal Island , but in the city of Montreal and in Quebec City .
reform members are suggesting that , if a referendum had been held , they may have been able to go along .
but their support now depends on a petition signed by 235,000 people .
i would like to ask the hon. member a question concerning the holding of a referendum on this issue .
how would that help him as a member of Parliament to better determine whether there is a consensus ?
what factor is he going to use ?
the debate here is not on trying to establish that 78 % of the people are in favour .
the debate here is to ensure the majority of the minority affected is well represented and has given its consent .
i think that has been demonstrated time and time again .
how will the holding of a referendum notwithstanding its costs help to ensure the member ' s making his decision ?
Mr. Ted White :
madam Speaker , I recognize the member would have preferred to have addressed his question to my colleague , and so I will make a suggestion in that regard in a moment .
first I will address the question of referendums .
referendums cost money of course .
there is a cost to democracy .
it is a matter of how much cost we are willing to accept in order to have democracy .
on the specific issue of what percentage should be accepted in a referendum , that is established before the question is put .
for me to give a broad brush answer that it should be 50 % plus 1 would not be fair .
it depends on the issue and the agreement beforehand as to what would be an appropriate percentage .
there are different rules depending on what is perceived by society to be the seriousness of the question .
as I recognize that the majority of the content of the hon. member ' s question was really for my colleague , I would like to ask the unanimous consent of the House to allow my colleague to answer .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
does the member have the unanimous consent of the House to proceed in such a way ?
some hon. members :
No.
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
questions and comments , the hon. member for Acadie - Bathurst .
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NPD ) :
madam Speaker , if my colleague from the Reform Party changes his vote only because I rose in this House , I will do so a lot more often .
what I have been trying to say is that we have a problem with a referendum .
whatever the percentage in favour of a change , be it 51 % , 52 % or even 60 % or 80 % , will they side with the 80 % majority who want the change or with the 20 % minority who are opposed ?
that is what I was driving at .
i was on the committee that studied school reform to make schools non - denominational .
i did not receive any letters from the bishops of Quebec saying that they were concerned about changes to section 93 .
i did not receive any letters from Protestant leaders either , even though , being on the committee , I was close to the situation .
this issue did not arise only three weeks ago .
i think it was the best time for a party to score political points .
but even the Liberal opposition was in favour .
that is why I was saying earlier that people must be careful when they say that it is the separatists who want this change .
i think there is a consensus among Quebeckers on this issue .
i may have a problem with separatists , but it is my problem .
every time Quebeckers ask something of us , I think it is wrong to pin the separatist label on them , especially when we see that there is a consensus among bishops , parents , school boards and all the people of Quebec on this issue .
there may not have been public hearings just before the change , but there was a consensus in most groups .
so I think we must be careful with this .
this is a warning .
we must also be careful with what we say in this House .
if we want to keep Quebec in Canada , we must treat it with respect .
Mr. Ted White :
Mr. Speaker , I must apologize to the hon. member because I did not realize I was still on questions and answers .
i was having a discussion about the petition with my colleague .
i caught the end of the comments and I will do my best to respond .
i would like to say first of all , although he is mentioning that it is being portrayed that the separatists want this , it is certainly not what I have felt or portrayed .
it is obvious then that there is a very high level of consent and it certainly gives a high comfort level for the result there .
certainly I would never say that it is something the separatists want , however I would just like to make the point here that I am sorry that members did not allow my colleague to answer the last question because I believe the quality of the debate would have been improved by allowing more of the interaction that was going on .
if the hon. member wishes to speak to me afterward , that is fine .
Mr. John Cummins ( Delta - South Richmond , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to bring forward some concerns I have about this resolution .
with this resolution Parliament has been asked to amend the constitution in order to eliminate rights that have been expressly guaranteed in the constitution .
since this is a resolution that deals with denominational or confessional rights , Parliament has an even greater role to play because of the existing wording of the constitution .
parliament has , according to sections 93 ( 3 ) and 93 ( 4 ) , a guardian kind of role to play in the protection of minority denominational rights .
parliament is the guarantor of minority denominational rights and the guarantor of denominational education rights .
we have an awesome responsibility when we are asked to extinguish those rights .
yet we are being asked to expropriate without compensation the rights enjoyed by certain Quebeckers .
i am concerned that we are not taking seriously our constitutionally mandated role as a guarantor of denominational education rights .
much of the debate surrounding this resolution has assumed that Parliament can pass a resolution because it complies with the requirements of the amending provisions of the constitution , in particular section 43 of the Constitution Act , 1982 .
this is not so .
we must first ask ourselves , as guarantor of denominational education rights , if this resolution affects or diminishes a right that we are obligated to protect .
furthermore , where a legislature or Parliament seeks to amend the constitution to eliminate expressly guaranteed minority rights , I would submit that mere compliance with the formal requirements of the amending formula is insufficient .
any such amendment must also satisfy a constitutional convention that prevents the alteration of expressly guaranteed constitutional minority rights without the consent of the affected minority .
this House should recall the political and legal events which preceded the passage of the Constitution Act of 1982 .
on October 2 , 1980 the federal government proposed presenting to Her Majesty the Queen in right of the United Kingdom a resolution to patriate the Canadian constitution .
eight of the provinces opposed this unilateral action by Parliament on the basis that the patriation resolution would affect provincial powers .
several provinces submitted references to their courts of appeal on the question as to whether Parliament could seek the amendment of the constitution without the consent of the provinces .
the Supreme Court of Canada ultimately considered the provincial references and in 1981 released its decision .
the court held that although as a matter of law the agreement of the provinces was not required for amendments to the Constitution of Canada , the court decided there existed the constitutional convention that Parliament would not seek to amend the constitution affecting provincial powers without first obtaining the agreement of the provinces .
as a result of this decision the federal government commenced a series of constitutional consultations which culminated in the agreement of nine of the provinces to what we now know as the Constitution Act , 1982 .
if a constitutional convention exists in the case of amendments which affect provincial powers , it has been suggested to the joint committee by the Catholic Civil Rights League that a constitutional convention exists in the case of an amendment to the constitution which would eliminate expressly guaranteed minority rights .
first , the history of our constitution displays a commitment to the preservation and expansion of denominational minority rights , not their elimination .
professor Peter Hogg , a renowned constitutional scholar , has described section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1987 as a small bill of rights for the protection of minority religious groups .
when the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was enacted in 1982 , a special section , section 92 , was included to ensure that the charter did not derogate from constitutionally guaranteed denominational schools rights .
second , Canadian constitutional history has not witnessed an amendment which eliminated constitutionally protected minority rights .
on the contrary , the enactment of the charter in 1982 was thought to herald an era of increased protection of minority rights .
the government has acknowledged the existence of this constitutional convention .
in introducing this resolution , the government stressed that Parliament must satisfy itself that a consensus exists among the affected parties in Quebec in favour of repealing the protections contained in sections 93 ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) of the Constitution Act of 1867 .
in other words , those prejudicially affected by the resolution must consent to its passage .
it should be clear to this House that the persons who will be prejudicially affected by a repeal of the protections guaranteed in Quebec under section 93 are the parents who send their children to denominational schools .
for many months , associations of Quebec parents have voiced their rigorous opposition to the resolution .
the requirements of the constitutional convention that the consent of the affected minority be obtained has not been satisfied .
it is not enough to point to the support for the resolution from some unions , school board organizations or clerical groups .
the rights guaranteed under section 93 are the rights of the parents and the parents have not been consulted by the Quebec or federal governments , nor has their consent been secured .
to do so would run counter to our constitutional convention that minority rights cannot be restricted by amendment unless the proper governmental parties obtain the agreement of the affected minority groups and would run counter to our responsibility to protect denominational school rights .
minority rights enshrined in the Constitution should not be subject to limitation or elimination by a majority , otherwise the constitution affords no meaningful protection for minority rights .
the preamble to our charter of rights and freedoms identifies one of the two fundamental principles of our country as the rule of law .
where a majority can abrogate constitutional rights expressly granted to minority groups , the rule of law no longer operates but has been replaced by the simple naked rule of the will of the majority .
for this fundamental reason this House should not pass the resolution .
furthermore , the Government of Quebec has not demonstrated any legislative necessity for the proposed constitutional amendment .
section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms stresses that a legislature cannot violate charter guaranteed rights unless it can demonstrate that the violation is reasonably justifiable .
surely where a legislature seeks a constitutional amendment to eliminate minority rights , the legislature must clearly show that it cannot achieve a pressing and substantial legislative objective without eliminating minority rights .
in this case , the province of Quebec has not demonstrated that the repeal of section 93 rights is necessary to achieve its objective of restructuring its school boards without eliminating confessional dissension guarantees .
this Parliament should not agree to repeal constitutionally guaranteed minority rights where the highest court in the land has shown how a provincial government can pursue its legislative objective without requiring any constitutional amendment .
in addition to establishing dangerous precedents regarding the erosion or elimination of rights expressly guaranteed in our constitution , I think that passage of the resolution will have serious , long term effects on the ability of parents to secure an education for their children in accordance with their religious beliefs .
although the Quebec government has given assurances that it will maintain some confessional schools in the province , prior court decisions under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms clearly show that such confessional schools will collapse under the first charter challenge brought against them .
decisions under the charter have made it clear that neither religious observances nor religious education are permitted in publicly funded schools unless those schools are protected by section 93 of the Constitution Act , 1867 .
the Supreme Court of Canada has recognized the right of parents to educate their children according to their beliefs as an integral element of the guarantee of freedom of religion contained in section 2 ( a ) of the charter .
in the Richard B . case , Mr. Justice LaForest , speaking for the majority , stated :
it seems to me that the right of parents to rear their children according to their religious beliefs is an equally fundamental aspect of freedom of religion .
the court went on to hold :
that constitutional freedom includes the right to educate and rear their child in the tenets of their faith .
in effect , until the child reaches an age where she can make an independent decision regarding her own religious beliefs , her parents may decide on her religion for her and raise her in accordance with that religion .
international conventions have enshrined education as a basic human right .
the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms , one of the sources of our charter of rights and freedoms , states :
no person shall be denied the right of education .
in the exercise of any function which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure that such education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions .
many parents seek to educate their children in accordance with their religion by sending their children to private or independent schools .
in the 1986 Jones case decision the Supreme Court of Canada strongly suggested that if a province ' s education legislation did not permit parents to send their children to religious private schools , then the legislation would infringe on the parents ' freedom of religion .
however , if a province can secure a constitutional amendment which eliminates expressly guaranteed denominational education rights , what obligation would a province have to parents of different faiths to allow them to educate their children in private religious schools ?
the answer to this question is clear .
i therefore have grave concerns that the passage of this resolution would create a climate in which provinces can act more readily to restrict the ability of parents to raise and educate their children in accordance with their religious beliefs .
this resolution marks the first time in Canadian history that Parliament has been asked to amend the constitution in order to eliminate rights which have been expressly guaranteed in the constitution .
because of that it is very important that Parliament formulate a very clear test which it will apply to determine whether it should accept the resolution before it .
since this is a resolution that deals with denominational rights , Parliament has an even greater role to play because of the existing wording of the constitution .
sections 93 ( 3 ) and 93 ( 4 ) indicate that Parliament has a guardian role to play in the protection of minority denominational rights .
parliament is the guarantor of minority denominational rights .
as guarantor it has an awesome responsibility when asked to extinguish those rights .
it is very important that the consent or the consensus be from those whose rights are affected .
the people whose rights are affected when dealing with section 93 ( 1 ) in Quebec are the parents who are part of that class of protected persons who have the opportunity under the current constitution to gain confessional education for their children .
that is the group to which I submit this House should look in determining whether a consensus exists .
the parents are the holders of the right .
i would recommend to the House that any proposed constitutional amendment should impair the guaranteed constitutional rights only to the minimum extent required to achieve the legislative objective .
there is no novelty in this test .
the Supreme Court of Canada has formulated the minimal impairment test to use whenever it analyses whether legislation infringes on rights guaranteed under the charter .
this House should insist on a similar demonstration of minimal impairment where a resolution to amend the constitution will infringe on rights guaranteed by the constitution .
the second point is what will the impact of the passage of this resolution be on denominational or confessional schools in Quebec .
some have suggested that confessional schools legally can exist without the need for protection under section 93 ( 1 ) .
with all due respect to those who advance that idea , it is my submission that this suggestion is without legal foundation for three reasons .
first , the Supreme Court of Canada in the Ontario Bill 30 case back in 1988 clearly indicated that denominational or confessional rights are grounded solely in section 93 ( 1 ) of the constitution .
there is no other place in the constitution that protects them .
second , if denominational schools lack constitutional protection and are then exposed to scrutiny under the charter they will be struck down .
they will fall within the next day .
i can say that with some assurance because of the evidence presented before the joint committee .
in an Ontario case , the Elgin County case , which is a leading case in the area , a religious education program was struck down as being in violation of the religious provisions of the charter .
the same thing will happen if Quebec denominational schools are exposed to charter scrutiny without the protection of section 93 ( 1 ) .
whenever a province submits a request for a constitutional resolution or a constitutional amendment , it is a very serious proposition and requires due consideration but it does not require Parliament to immediately accept or reject the resolution .
the hearings of the special joint committee have established that there are deep reservations among a number of groups in Quebec as to the loss of their rights and as to the status of their rights for confessional schools in the event section 93 ( 1 ) is repealed .
i would propose that the House not act on the resolution at the present time in light of those concerns .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I commend the hon. member for his very thoughtful remarks .
although he was not a member of the committee it seems he has paid very close attention to the evidence presented to it .
could the hon. member comment on the argument that predicates this application to extinguish subsections 1 through 4 of section 93 .
on further reflection I will quote from the judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1993 on the reference regarding the Quebec education act to further elucidate the point he made .
in that judgment the learned justices said that what section 93 guarantees is the right to dissent per se , not the right to certain legal institutions through which it may be exercised , i . e . school boards .
they furthermore say that there is thus no objection to the principle of redistributing the patrimony of the existing school boards for Protestants and Catholics among the linguistic boards provided the new institutions and their establishment maintain the right to dissent and to denominational schools .
finally they go on to say at page 39 of their judgment that the framers of the constitution were wise enough not to determine finally the form of institutions as it is those very institutions which must be capable of change in order to adapt to the varying social and economic conditions of society .
in other words , our highest court said that we do not have to maintain denominational school boards in order to establish linguistic school boards .
we do not have to eliminate section 93 to establish linguistic school boards .
we do not have to abolish these confessional rights in order to do what the Quebec government chooses to do .
Mr. John Cummins :
Mr. Speaker , my understanding is that the Quebec government has the ability to legislate whatever changes it wants in the administration of the schools to allow for linguistic guarantees and so on .
section 93 of the Constitution Act would not impair that ability whatsoever .
in my view the key issue is who is going to be responsible for educating our children .
this whole debate reminds me so much of the debate on the Newfoundland schools act .
the question there was again who is going to define the kinds of schools that I send my children to .
it comes back down to my way of thinking as an attempt by the provincial governments in both cases to gain ultimate control over their school systems so they can define clearly what is taught and how it will be taught .
it is clear that those school boards have difficulty accepting the notion that some parents may want to educate their children based on certain religious principles .
i think that is wrong .
education of children ultimately lies with the parents .
it should be their choice on the types of schools their children attend .
we should be broadening the notion of access to different types of schools rather than restricting it .
we are much more of a multicultural nation than we were have been in years gone by .
our school systems should reflect that .
our school systems should teach the fact that Canada is a great place to live , that we are a tolerant nation and that we can be that by still subscribing to the basic religious beliefs we have .
those religious beliefs should not be undermined at all by the school systems to which we send our children .
clearly to me the issue is who is going to control the education for our children and what guarantees are there that I am going to have or that the people of Quebec in this instance are going to have to educate their children in the religious schools that they have been guaranteed since Confederation in 1867 .
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am outraged and embarrassed to hear people so closed to what is truly going on in Quebec .
we are talking about consensus ; not unanimity , but consensus .
all political parties have supported it through a unanimous resolution in the National Assembly , the bishops have approved it , and now the member wants to tell us how to run the school system in Quebec and elsewhere .
this is 1997 .
there is a situation that must be corrected , an error that must be put right to end a debate that has gone on for 30 years .
these dinosaurs across the floor are no help to me in Quebec in selling the system I want to live in .
this is why I am happy to say in the House that this amendment will be passed because it is important that it be passed .
it will be passed because we are going to show , despite what the Reform members are saying - and that is why they will always be in the opposition - that this is a flexible system .
there is accommodation , and a Constitution is a fundamental law of a country that must represent all its citizens .
when we see what is now happening with the Reform Party , we may again ask ourselves what planet they are living on .
i ask the member and all Reform Party members to listen to what Quebec has said and to take a stand once and for all in order to resolve this problem and to help a people improve its situation .
Mr. John Cummins :
Mr. Speaker , we had unanimous consent from the political elites in this country on the Charlottetown accord and we all know what happened when that went to the vote of the people .
it was rejected .
i suggest to my friend across the way that we have a similar situation .
if there was that kind of support that he talks about in the province of Quebec for this change , why is it that consent from the people was not sought by the legislature in Quebec ?
why is it that the legislature in Quebec cannot demonstrate quite clearly that there is broad based support for this issue ?
at the same time as it does that , why can the legislature of Quebec not guarantee that the minority which will be affected by the elimination of this right is in agreement with this principle ?
if we do not protect the rights of the minority , if we cannot demonstrate that we have a clear consensus from the minority in favour of this legislation , then we should not move ahead .
if we do move ahead , what guarantee is there for any of us in our constitution ?
there is simply none .
the constitution is not worth the paper it is written on if it will not protect the rights of the minority .
we should not be flippantly changing the constitution just to meet the whim of the day .
the constitution certainly is a living , breathing document but it must guarantee rights for all times and not just when it meets with our pleasure .
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu 茅 bec , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question will be a very short one .
i would like , however , to remind my hon. colleague from the Reform Party that what is going on here is not a debate on the place of religion in the schools .
i can understand the concerns of those who want religious teaching to continue in the schools .
but in Bill 109 on public education , Minister Marois set out guarantees which protect the wishes of parents .
my hon. colleague from the Reform Party seems to be concerned about parental desire to keep religious schools .
these rights are guaranteed by the bill on public education and by section 41 of the Charter .
it is a matter of administration .
i would like to provide a few clarifications , in order to disabuse those listening to us who may think we are discussing the place of religion .
denominational school boards are no longer adapted to the reality of what is going on in Quebec .
Mr. John Cummins :
Mr. Speaker , in my remarks I indicated quite clearly and I acknowledge the fact that the Quebec government has given assurances that it will maintain confessional schools in the provinces .
as I said , prior to court decisions , challenges under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms have clearly shown that such confessional schools will collapse under the first charter challenge if this act passes this House .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
Mr. Speaker , on a point of order .
i would ask for the unanimous consent of the House for you to call it 6.30 p.m. and adjourn the debate .
the Deputy Speaker :
i think the hon. member is premature .
the Chair has no alternative .
the debate is concluded if no member is rising to speak .
i will put the question but I must deal with this .
no dilatory motion is permitted until the matter has been disposed of in the House .
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Deputy Speaker :
pursuant to the order made Thursday , November 6 , 1997 , the motion is deemed to have been put and a recorded division deemed demanded and deferred until Tuesday , November 18 , 1997 at the expiry of the time provided for government orders .
( division deemed demanded and deferred )
the Deputy Speaker :
is there unanimous consent , as suggested by the hon. member for Bourassa , to call it 6.30 p.m. ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Deputy Speaker :
accordingly , it being 6.30 p.m. , the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
( the House adjourned at 6.02 p.m. )

government ORDERS
customs TARIFF
the House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C - 11 , an act respecting the imposition of duties of customs and other charges , to give effect to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System , to provide relief against the imposition of certain duties of customs or other charges , to provide for other related matters and to amend or repeal certain acts in consequence thereof , as reported ( with amendment ) from the committee .
( motion agreed to )
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure today to speak to Bill C - 11 , an act to simplify and update Canada ' s tariff system .
members will recall that during the second reading debate , widespread support was voiced for this legislation from both sides of the House .
i am pleased to report that support was also evident at committee .
indeed , I believe that most members were of the view that while Bill C - 11 is and might be low profile and somewhat technical , it nevertheless represents an important contribution to making Canada a more competitive player in world trade and will in fact help to maintain jobs in Canada .
in that respect , we heard during debate and in committee that trade is the economic lifeblood of Canada .
clearly then , it is in our national interest to advance measures , such as Bill C - 11 , that simplify importing and enhance Canadian producers ' ability to compete both at home and abroad .
members will know that the customs tariff is a key component of Canada ' s import regime .
in my view it represents the nuts and bolts of import transactions undertaken by thousands of Canadian importers on a daily basis .
it not only classifies all goods that may be imported into Canada but also provides for applicable tariffs and import duty relieving measures to assist Canadian businesses .
put simply , despite going largely unnoticed by the general public , the customs tariff touches on the daily economic activities of millions of Canadians .
it is thus important that we take every effort as we are doing with Bill C - 11 to ensure that the tariff is as efficient and as up to date as possible .
anything less would in fact entail an unnecessary burden to Canadian industry .
i remind the House that the Canadian industry has played an integral role in developing this legislation .
since 1994 when this initiative was launched , extensive and detailed consultations have been undertaken with interested parties regarding the proposals contained in Bill C - 11 .
as well , to facilitate input and to help secure consensus , the government has disseminated the proposals as broadly as possible .
in fact , each of the proposals to change the existing customs tariff has been published in the Canada Gazette .
to go further , advertisements were placed in some of Canada ' s leading newspapers inviting comments from both industry and individuals .
as a result , the importing and manufacturing communities strongly support the changes embodied in this bill .
they particularly support the measures for greater simplicity , for transparency and predictability , all of which should help to improve the competitiveness of Canadian industries .
moreover , industry unanimously endorses the implementation of the new simplified customs tariff on January 1 , 1998 .
to sum up the virtues of this bill , let me use the words of the hon. member for Calgary South rather than my own .
as he eloquently put it during the second reading debate , the cumulative effect is a more predictable , simplified tariff legislation with less regulatory burden and increased competitive strength .
very eloquently put .
as I mentioned , this view was confirmed during the hearings of Bill C - 11 in the House standing committee on industry .
clearly the witnesses from the manufacturing and importing associations welcomed the benefits of this bill , especially with respect to the positive effects the legislation will have on their competitiveness .
particular mention was made of the duty reductions on a wide range of inputs used in the manufacturing processes .
they also welcome the streamlining of the existing tariff system to facilitate the importation of goods into Canada and to reduce compliance and administrative costs for business .
specifically , some witnesses objected to the inclusion in the tariff schedule to Bill C - 11 of the provision that continues duty free status for auto parts used by non - auto pact producers as inputs in assembling motor vehicles in Canada .
the purpose behind this measure being continued in Bill C - 11 is to maintain a uniform manufacturing environment for all auto assemblers in Canada .
the continuation of a zero tariff on auto parts is consistent with this objective .
bill C - 11 ensures that Canada will continue to be an attractive place for automotive investment by maintaining a level playing field for auto manufacturing in Canada .
i should also point out that this bill contains a number of measures that all participants in the auto industry will benefit from .
they include the unconditional duty free provisions covering all production machinery , precision instruments and apparatus , as well as all materials for manufacturing vehicles , parts and accessories .
that is the one concern .
i also want to take a few minutes to address concerns that have been expressed by some in the importing community that there may not be enough time to prepare themselves fully for the scheduled January 1 , 1998 implementation date .
revenue Canada and Statistics Canada appreciate that there is a large change over in data that must be installed in importing systems in order to be ready for the new tariff .
that is why since April of this year there has been an ongoing outreach campaign by the department of revenue to assist in these necessary preparations by providing the data required to update these systems .
i understand that Revenue Canada has discussed these issues with the importing community and is prepared to show flexibility provided that importers make their best efforts to apply the new tariff correctly .
furthermore , Revenue Canada is prepared to assist those who need help to identify the proper statistical information to do so before goods are imported into Canada .
the government has every confidence that the new simplified customs tariff represents a positive change for the importing community .
for its part , the importing community looks forward to the benefits the bill will confer , benefits including some $ 90 million in duty reductions in 1998 . Importers are also looking forward to having less red tape associated with their import transactions .
these are all issues that not only the importing community has made reference to , but the business community at large .
this is an area where the government has taken a step forward in reducing the regulatory burden and easing the administrative burden that small businesses and businesses in general face .
that goes forward on the competitive issue in allowing our Canadian companies to compete both domestically and internationally on a more level playing field .
in conclusion , while there is an effort required to adapt to the new tariff , it is certainly well worth it .
we have seen support from both sides of the House during second reading debate as well as in committee .
certainly it is a widely held view in the House and in industry .
i urge the House to pass Bill C - 11 quickly .
the faster Parliament passes this legislation , the more confident the business community will be that its efforts to adapt to the new tariff will not be in vain .
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C - 11 today .
i want to indicate that the Reform Party is supportive of the bill .
largely this is a bill which simplifies and harmonizes Canadian customs legislation .
when this bill landed on my desk for me to critique it on behalf of my party I thought we were getting a case of bills , but in fact it was only one .
it was a foot and a half thick .
we still have 8,000 tariff lines for import duties into Canada .
we can do even better than that and I hope we can in the future .
the free trade agreement negotiated some 10 years ago with the United States was one of the prime motivators to phase out tariffs .
the tariffs between Canada and the United States had been phased out except in a couple of areas like supply management and textiles , that type of area .
in response to that we were able to clean up a lot of customs lines .
the Reform Party supports this bill because we are supportive of free trade in general .
we would even go further .
we want to have further trade liberalization and we believe that the only protection Canadian industry really deserves and needs is protection from exporters from other countries that are selling product in this country that is subsidized or protected by tariff at home .
we feel we can compete head on on the basis of production with the best in the world .
industry in general is starting to recognize this .
companies such as Teleglobe have been privatized .
they are saying we should open up investment because they want to be able to compete with the best in the world .
there is a big market outside of Canada and if we want to do that , if we want to have trade liberalization in other countries we have to provide that at home as well .
we have good trade agreements .
we must move further to keep this bicycle rolling down the road .
we must move further to try to reduce tariffs and subsidies in countries such as those in Europe .
by doing so I believe we will be able to reduce our tariff activity in Canada , our import tariff regime , even further than the 8,000 tariff lines we have for the protection of industry .
that will mean industries that compete on the basis of production will compete head on worldwide in that new world out there .
on that basis I would have to say that although Revenue Canada raises about $ 3 billion a year on tariffs , there is a very large bureaucracy that has to administer that tariff structure .
we hear of Canadian government officials who travel to places like Georgia to check on their carpet manufacturing industry to see if they are not dumping into Canada .
we see they have to be assessed duties .
it is a very expensive regime to keep in place .
there are a number of areas within the Canadian economy that already have quite a harmonized basis of business .
the steel industry is one example .
when we think of trade in Canada we sometimes think of product moving outside of Canada or into Canada by the shipload .
in fact , most of our trade does not occur that way .
eighty - three per cent of our exports go to the United States and most of our exports move across the 49 th parallel day in and day out by truck .
it is a small commercial quantity that is moving to service some need .
it might even be that a parent company is either in Canada or the United States .
we are moving more and more toward a harmonized trade relationship with the United States in particular .
this is reflected by the fact that we are going to be phasing out our customs duties in those areas .
however , we have 8,000 customs duty lines left .
the sooner we can move to trade liberalization so Canadian companies can compete head on with companies outside of Canada that are neither subsidized nor protected by tariff , the better off we will be and the sooner we will be able to clean up the rest of our customs lines .
we support the early implementation of the bill and we support its passage .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau ( Repentigny , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am rising today to speak , as my colleagues have before me , on the third reading of Bill C - 11 , an act respecting the imposition of duties of customs and other charges .
this bill will replace the Customs Tariff currently in effect and simplify its application .
this bill is extremely significant for Canada .
first of all , because it will make life easier for our businesses , but mainly because this is a preliminary effort on the part of the government to get rid of numerous rules relating to customs duties that are both obsolete and useless .
we , along with the people of Canada , have long been calling for less bureaucracy and more efficiency in our government system .
the resulting savings will be of benefit to Canadian businesses and Canadian taxpayers .
my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois and myself support Bill C - 11 , for it is high time there was some tidying up of Canada ' s Customs Tariff .
moreover , the World Trade Organization shared that opinion .
in its July 2 , 1990 report on Canada ' s trade policy , the WTO described the Canadian tariff system as " complex and lacking transparency '' .
seven years ago , that was the WTO ' s comment on our customs system .
the time was therefore ripe for a thorough reform of Canada ' s Customs Tariff .
when the February 1994 budget was tabled , the Minister of Finance made a commitment to undertake an in - depth examination of the Canadian customs duty system , and he set himself a three - year deadline .
as I said earlier , we support Bill C - 11 .
it has known since then that the new tariff was to take effect in January 1998 - in less than two months .
so why did the Minister of Finance involve parliamentarians only just recently ?
bill C - 11 was relegated to the Standing Committee on Industry - not even the finance committee , which is too busy with prebudget consultations - two weeks ago .
despite the fact that they have known since 1994 and that the bill was ready in 1996 , they dumped it on the industry committee less than two weeks ago .
bill C - 11 is an important bill that requires a long , hard look .
the members of the committee would have welcomed help and information with open arms to get this express examination done .
the government often uses this pressure and delaying tactic to force the opposition to pass a technical and complex bill requiring long hours of examination .
we have a right to question the time allocated to the committee as well as the need to have the legislation come into effect by January 1 , 1998 .
we have had it with this approach .
it is not the first time that the government has acted this way .
the most recent example was the multilateral agreement on investment .
the subcommittee on international trade , trade disputes and investment was mandated by the Minister of International Trade to hear witnesses and produce a report by mid - December , that is to say before the Christmas break .
does the Liberal government know what the expression " public consultations " really means or does it just use the words blindly ?
this government is showing contempt for what the people of Canada think and for the opposition .
it is extremely difficult to do our job in the opposition under such circumstances .
we often get the feeling that the government would rather we did not do our job , so it can get anything through and hide tons of technical papers .
for the Liberals , to consult means posting a document on the Internet , discussing with two or three people and expecting parliamentarians to trust them blindly .
this government has never managed to win our trust and this is not about to change .
we should point out that , as usual with the Liberal government , public consultations were botched .
there are groups that were not consulted , and those that were have not been heard properly .
that was the case of the Canadian automotive industry .
the Canadian vehicle manufacturers association , which represents Chrysler Canada , Ford Canada , Freightliner Canada , General Motors Canada , Navistar International Canada and Volvo Canada , repeatedly tried to voice its concerns to the finance minister and his officials .
the association testified before the Standing Committee on Industry , which studied Bill C - 11 .
witnesses informed committee members that they disagreed with the government ' s unilateral decision to eliminate customs duties on auto parts on January 1 , 1996 .
at that time , the association was strongly opposed to such a move .
it asked the committee to wait before confirming definitely the elimination of customs duties for auto parts in the new Customs Tariff .
the association told the committee that a study was being conducted on the automobile industry and that this study would deal with such matters as customs tariffs on parts and complete vehicles .
the study is being conducted by Industry Canada , the Department of Finance and the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade .
according to the information we have , a report should be released at the beginning of 1998 .
there is another matter I would like to speak to .
the Canadian Automobile Manufacturers Association is also strongly opposed to the elimination of customs duties on assembled vehicles .
the Bloc Quebecois shares this concern .
i asked a question on this matter last March , and the Minister of Finance answered by saying that he was studying the issue .
in April 1997 , following a question from the Liberal member from Windsor , the Minister of International Trade at that time made a commitment not to eliminate customs duties on assembled vehicles .
we hope the Liberal government will finally be able to keep a promise .
the consequences of eliminating customs duties could be serious for the Canadian automobile industry .
the Canadian government should be able to protect an industry when it needs it .
representatives of the automobile industry were told that the Canadian government cannot wait for Industry Canada ' s report because Bill C - 11 must come into effect on January 1 , 1998 .
we question the urgency of implementing the Customs Tariff , but it seems that the government will make every effort to pass this bill quickly .
we are concerned about the automobile industry in Canada .
that is why we are following closely Industry Canada ' s study to ensure that it is properly conducted and that its conclusions reflect the needs of Canada ' s automobile industry .
it should be noted that the January 1998 deadline is also a concern for the companies themselves , which will have to be ready to apply the new changes in a few weeks .
when the committee reviewed this issue , Revenue officials announced that businesses would benefit from a six - month grace period before being penalized for non - compliance .
we hope that the government will indeed be lenient toward these companies , because it prepared this new tariff to help them and not to hinder them .
for the benefit of Quebec businesses we will support Bill C - 11 , because the proposed standardization and streamlining of the Custom Tariff are necessary for both Quebec and Canada .
for once , the government is making life simpler for Canadian businesses by helping them become more competitive at the international level .
it must also be realized that , with the signing of international trade agreements , our tariff structure has become more complex , thus making Bill C - 11 all the more appropriate .
the proposed changes in the bill include a consolidation of Canadian tariff obligations under the Canada - U.S. Free Trade Agreement , the North American Free Trade Agreement , the World Trade Organization , the Canada - Israel Free Trade Agreement and the Canada - Chile Free Trade Agreement .
it is imperative that Canada fulfil its international obligations .
the Bloc Quebecois has always been in favour of globalization , unlike the Liberals who just recently realized the importance of free trade agreements .
they are now converts .
unlike the Liberal government , however , we are not prepared to engage in trade at any cost .
we believe in respect for human rights , labour standards and environmental standards .
it is high time the Liberals learned to promote trade while also emphasizing respect for social and human rights .
recently , the foreign affairs minister had a good opportunity to do so , but he did not .
on September 5 , 1997 , a group of Canadian private businesses , including Alcan , announced the creation of an international code of ethics for Canadian companies .
following a study by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade on small and medium size export businesses , we proposed that the government set up a code of ethics for Canadian companies doing business abroad .
far from acting like a leader , the Liberal government does not even require crown corporations to comply with the private sector ' s code of ethics .
the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for International Trade are not even encouraging agencies that report to them to adopt the code of conduct .
this is a disgrace , to say the least .
the president of the Export Development Corporation , better known as EDC , told the committee that EDC had not yet taken a decision at the time we were speaking as to whether or not it was going to respect the much discussed international code of conduct .
with EDC lending large amounts to Canadian enterprises and not ensuring that they respect social and human rights in the countries in which they are investing , this is unacceptable .
the government , with the help of EDC , is strongly encouraging Canadian enterprises to invest in Colombia .
Colombia is currently in the grip of what for us is an unthinkable crisis .
the people of Colombia are being terrorized by paramilitary soldiers and guerillas .
Colombian teachers have the world ' s highest mortality rate .
four out of every ten labour leaders in the world have been assassinated in Colombia .
torture and repeated violations of human rights are common occurrences .
and yet the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for International Trade are encouraging Canadian businesses to invest in Colombia .
we hope that the Liberal government will finally understand the importance of respecting the social standards set out in international agreements .
one step in the right direction would be to have Canadian enterprises respect the international code of conduct .
in conclusion , I remind members that the Bloc Quebecois will be voting in favour of Bill C - 11 , for the new tariff code benefits Canadian businesses and is consistent with respect for our international obligations .
Mr. Chris Axworthy ( Saskatoon - Rosetown - Biggar , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am happy to debate Bill C - 11 and to be the representative of the only party which is taking a pro - Canadian view on these international trade matters .
as has been mentioned Bill C - 11 is an enormously lengthy document .
it sets out to do a number of things , not all of which are terrible .
nonetheless it is a continuation of the process of implementing what has been disastrous free trade deals signed by Canada , particularly disastrous because they signed away things that never needed to be signed away .
among other things Bill C - 11 attempts to simplify customs tariff and rationalize various provisions in the customs tariff as well as delete provisions that are no longer relevant .
there are also rate reductions on a wide range of goods , mostly on manufacturing inputs , an elimination of a large number of tariff codes and regulations , a rounding down of decimal rates , and the elimination of most rates that fall below 2 % .
the bill is supported by most members of Canada ' s business community because it will reduce their costs .
it will in part implement the free trade agreements , in particular NAFTA .
we in the New Democratic Party remain alone in being opposed to the terms of free trade agreements .
that is not to say that we are opposed to trade or opposed to fair trade .
i come from the province of Saskatchewan which trades more than any other province in the country .
canada trades more than any other country by various different measurements in terms of percentage of exports , GDP and so on .
i am not opposed to trade , but I am opposed to unfair trade which encourages the continual control of our economy by the United States .
indeed we have become ever more dependent on one market , the United States .
no sensible business person , no sensible country , no sensible person would ever suggest that it is desirable to focus and be dependent on one market as a result of the many things that flowed from these trade deals .
it is simply foolish .
to be so dependent means that in the event of a downturn in the American economy we will follow suit .
it also means we have lost much more control of our economy .
we did not have much before , but we gave away much of it in these deals .
had we been more international , had we been more open , had we been more external in our focus , we would have been able to diversify our trade more effectively to other markets around the world which are growing and in good shape .
as I mentioned , the New Democratic Party remains the only party opposed to these deals .
the Liberal Party was strongly opposed to the free trade agreement when in opposition but when it became government - and you will remember this , Mr. Speaker , because you were part of that transition - the Liberal Party became the main flag bearer for free trade agreements .
the Prime Minister takes some pride in being described as being the main flag bearer for the free trade arrangements in North America and further afield in South America also .
it was an amazing transformation as the Liberal Party moved from opposition benches to government benches and began to listen more and more to those in the business community and less and less to ordinary Canadians struggling to make ends meet .
i , my party , my province and I think all Canadians support a focus on trade in an effort to ensure we create a vibrant and dynamic economy , one which provides decent jobs for those who need them .
these deals have not done that .
this simplified customs tariff , which is merely a part of the whole process , will not do that either .
it is time the government spoke up on behalf of Canadians , on behalf of a trade policy and on behalf of an economic policy that works for Canadians and not just for those who are wealthy , those who are privileged and those who control a large measure of our economy , most of whom are not Canadians but from elsewhere .
in closing , I reiterate my and my party ' s opposition to Bill C - 11 and to the whole context within which the bill is presented , the context of free trade agreements in which Canada gave up so much of its sovereignty for so little .
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to make a couple of comments and to ask a question .
i listened to the representative from the Bloc who stated that his party would have liked to have been better informed about Bill C - 11 .
i wish to note that background information on the bill was supplied to all opposition parties before the examination in committee .
those who did were no doubt better informed about the bill and dealt with it in a more effective manner .
the member from the Bloc continued to say the process was flawed and that no one knew about it .
the bill and the customs tariff were published in the Canada Gazette .
letters were sent to interested parties .
it was placed on the Internet and on Revenue Canada ' s electronic bulletin board .
advertisements were placed in some leading national newspapers .
i wanted to clarify that for the record .
with respect to the comments made by my colleague from the NDP , he focused on the free trade issue , on different aspects of Bill C - 11 , and voiced his opposition to the bill .
the policy of the government is to expand trade globally .
we are dependent on the United States as our largest trading partner just south of the border , but we are continuing to expand trade globally through the team Canada approach which brought back billions of dollars to Canadian companies that are continuing to excel in exporting effectively .
i am sure members of companies from the west , the east and central Canada participated in team Canada .
i wonder if he could share some of that information .
perhaps he could demonstrate to the House that exports are good for Canadian companies , that exports provide Canadian jobs and that the core of our economic success has been the export market .
i would like to hear the hon. member give some indication that team Canada has worked and perhaps share the experience with some western companies .
Mr. Chris Axworthy :
Mr. Speaker , those western companies are not here but I am happy to make a brief comment .
our premier was part of the team Canada visits .
we have yet to see great fruit bearing from the visits , but I support the Prime Minister and the premiers in their efforts to expand trade around the world .
there are few who would argue that we should not expand trade and our exports .
a country like Canada will only survive , will only thrive , if we have healthy exporting markets and an environment within Canada which encourages businesses to respond to those markets .
the member picked up on the point I was raising .
with the agreements made first with the United States and then with Mexico , Canada ' s trade is focused on one market .
surely nobody would regard that as good .
there were efforts by earlier Liberal prime ministers to open up trade much more with Europe , a much bigger market than that of the United States , a market that is becoming bigger and bigger .
those efforts did not take us very far .
we did not diversify back in the eighties to other markets , but we were beginning to export more to other countries than the United States slowly but surely through the eighties and prior to the free trade agreements being signed .
since those agreements have been signed the focus has become evermore dependent on one market .
i merely wanted to reiterate that .
in the process I can certainly refer to the many meetings I have had with exporting companies in my province and in other provinces that are doing very well at the present time , certainly those in my province .
recently the Globe and Mail wrote about the western economies having reached full employment .
they must be doing something right .
the New Democratic Government of Saskatchewan has an effective approach to business and job creation .
it has consistently had the lowest unemployment rate in the country over the last two years .
it leads the country in economic indicators .
it must be doing something right .
i just wanted to make that point .
i will pass on to western exporting corporations the good wishes of the member opposite .
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau ( Repentigny , BQ ) :
i doubt that people will get up in the morning and start surfing the Net to check out the Revenue Canada or Finance Canada site and look in a Department of Finance subfile to see if it contains a bill that might eventually be of interest to them .
i would also like to point out that parliamentarians - because we are here among parliamentarians - only had two weeks to review and assess Bill C - 11 , whose schedules alone total 3,000 pages .
in fact , we had but two sessions at the industry committee , which should have been held at the finance committee .
when we speak of consultations , perhaps we should use the same definition , and when we speak about bogus consultations , we could perhaps ask the Liberals to give us a definition , because they are very good at that .
i now have a comment and a question for the NDP spokesperson who spoke earlier .
i noticed that the New Democratic Party does not support Bill C - 11 .
they were against previous free trade agreements , but the purpose of Bill C - 11 is to simplify trade and exports for companies in Quebec and Canada , including those in his riding .
so I have difficulty seeing how they can explain to their constituents that they are opposed to streamlining trade .
we are not talking about the free trade agreement that was concluded three , four or five years ago .
that was my first comment .
here is my question .
my hon. colleague may also have attended the industry committee sittings .
i would like to know what he thinks personally of the role of parliamentarians in the review of this particular bill , when we had two weeks and two weeks only to study a bill whose schedules alone total 3,000 pages .
before closing , I would like to make a brief comment and to ask the hon. member a short question on Canada ' s obligation to respect its international conventions .
whether we like it or not , Canada signed a free trade agreement with the United States and Mexico .
following the Liberals ' conversion , Canada also signed a free trade agreement with Israel and another with Chile , and Canada is an active member of the WTO .
does he not believe it is essential that Canada respect the international conventions it has signed ?
Mr. Chris Axworthy :
Mr. Speaker , I thank my friend from the Bloc for his question .
admittedly , we have international obligations and we must respond to those international treaties and implement them once we have signed them .
that does not mean that we in the New Democratic Party have to be happy about it or should support that requirement .
not being supportive of the arrangements which formed the basis of Bill C - 11 certainly provides adequate reasons to be opposed to Bill C - 11 .
that does not mean that the whole trend that Canada has embarked upon since 1988 with the signing of bilateral , trilateral and other deals which give up Canadian sovereignty even more than has been taken away by the globalization of world economies , is a good or desirable thing and it will never be something that the New Democratic Party supports .
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am sure that hon. members just cannot wait for this wonderful bill .
there seems to be a pretty decent consensus in the House for this bill , with the exception of the New Democratic Party which opposes free trade even when it is point blank in front of their faces that it has done wonderful things for Canada , created hundreds of thousands of jobs .
at least they are consistent in their opposition to free trade .
we cannot say that for the adaptable Liberal government which very quickly when they see a good idea , no matter where it comes from , will happily take advantage of it .
on the last occasion when we had an opportunity to speak in the House on Bill C - 11 , we stressed the importance of making legislation that simplifies our lives and simplifies the business practices of business owners .
today , I reiterate these words .
we acknowledge that Bill C - 11 will help improve the competitive position of Canadian industry within a freer trading environment as well as in the long run make the tariff system simpler .
however , there are some concerns that need to be addressed .
in committee we heard dissatisfaction from business owners as they faced pressures to adopt new methods according to legislative changes .
the time period allotted to them is unacceptable , given the nature of the changes they face .
second , some automotive manufacturers may face additional changes early in 1998 once a clear automotive policy is implemented .
i will address these two main points today .
first , amendments to this bill must be considerate of the business owner , the individual or groups of individuals who must implement our decisions in the real world .
they must be given the necessary time to implement changes and carry out the process .
second , it is inappropriate that the government take decisive actions when a clear automotive strategy is not in place as of yet .
while we know that industry generally supports the bill , we also know that they have qualms about it .
the issue of greatest concern to the committee is the sense of urgency that is being placed on the bill .
those with the Canadian Importers Association are very concerned with the speedy passage of this bill .
they point out that importers do not have sufficient time for what is a very time consuming and costly exercise .
they ask for a period of administrative tolerance .
this timeframe would allow them to adapt to the changes and alleviate their uneasiness with the timing of the proposed legislative changes .
the recurring message that we are hearing from the business community with respect to the uneasiness they face are their concerns related to the delivery and implementation of the tariff simplification initiative .
while they support the elimination of regulation and business procedures , they are deeply affected by the timing of this bill .
they feel it is quite rushed and they have not been granted enough time to prepare for the upcoming changes and the enormous challenges they will face .
the Alliance of Manufacturers is but one example of this concern .
these are the most affected parties .
we demand that the government listen to their concerns and continue with the theme of simplification .
if it is going to simplify the process , then it needs to continue with the agreement and simplify the law to all business owners .
we will hold the government accountable to this and urge it to listen to the suggestions it has received .
we also heard concerns from vehicle manufacturers groups .
it is no secret that Canada is in need of a strategic automotive policy , one based on free and fair trade .
why make changes now when a clear automotive policy is yet to be decided and risk having to amend the tariff to fit the policy later on ?
this plan is not logical .
it is not fair to the automotive industry .
the government ought to stop and think about the possible repercussions of amending clauses now and then setting its automotive policy .
by trying to rush through legislation , the government is missing the point .
a comprehensive automobile policy needs to be introduced in conjunction with clauses in Bill C - 11 which pertain to automotive tariffs .
why take the chance of negatively impacting jobs and investment in Canada ?
the free trade agreement that was so profusely objected to almost 10 years ago is today the largest bill on our shelves in the House of Commons .
it is a huge factor in contributing to tax revenues and job creation in this country .
the government continues to carry out our Conservative initiatives and our tariff agreements .
however , as I have highlighted , there are several important factors to consider .
this is the most complex tariff system in the world .
we know it and our trading partners know it .
i strongly urge the government to consider the huge task that lies in front of importers in Canada and demand that they be given time to adapt to these enormous changes .
as well , strategic consideration must be given to a comprehensive automotive policy .
my message today is that this is a beginning , not an end .
we cannot stop now with all the progress we have made for the simple reason that the bill has been simplified .
work still needs to be done .
i would ask the government to commit to continuing with the work in progress , to continue developing trade agreements with our partners and to look ahead at the global marketplace to achieve a standard of excellence with our trading partners .
this means that the government must continue to promote trade , thus encouraging business development and job creation in Canada .
hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I commend the hon. member for his excellent insights into this issue which is so important to Canadians .
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his intervention , but I want to clarify that Bill C - 11 does not make any changes to the current automotive tariff policy ; rather it continues to ensure that all auto manufacturers in Canada , auto pact and non - auto pact companies , import parts duty free .
no changes are made to vehicle tariffs .
auto pact companies continue to import vehicles free of duty while non - auto pact companies pay duty on all vehicles which they import .
i wonder whether the hon. member is now indicating that he wants to change that policy .
Mr. Charlie Power :
Mr. Speaker , that was not our intention .
when our caucus discussed this we decided to support it because it is under free trade and in line with the policies in which we very strongly believe .
our intention is that we should not be changing things today which will affect another policy which will come before the House next spring .
those are the things that drive businesses crazy .
the fact is that there is probably going to be a comprehensive automotive policy presented before the House in the next legislative sitting .
we thought that in order to make business a little easier we should not be making any changes today which may affect their jobs .
that is really where we are to with that .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is interesting to hear my esteemed colleague from St. John ' s West , from the island of Newfoundland , talking about the free trade deal and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it has created .
i wonder how many people in Newfoundland are listening to his comments today .
that province probably has one of the highest unemployment rates in North America if we break it down to a per capita ratio .
he said that the NDP is against free trade deals .
what we are against are deals that hurt Canadian workers .
he , coming from the province of Newfoundland , should know that better than anybody else .
the fact of the matter is it has driven labour standards , health standards and safety standards down to match third world country standards .
let me remind him of what happened in Mexico .
we were told when the Tories introduced free trade that Mexican workers ' standards would rise .
we were told that their standard of living would rise .
it is 1997 now and if we visit Mexico , as I have recently , we will notice that the standards for workers are lower than they have ever been .
those are the types of deals which we are against .
Mr. Charlie Power :
Mr. Speaker , just a brief reply .
obviously we in Newfoundland , as part of Canada , are very strongly supportive of the free trade agreement , but today in Newfoundland nobody is really talking about the free trade arrangements .
we are talking about the massive Hibernia oil project which was developed between the Government of Canada , the Government of Newfoundland and a large group of private sector partners which yesterday flowed oil for the first time .
there are an estimated 6 billion barrels of oil that can be processed or recovered from the offshore Hibernia field .
it is a great day for Newfoundland .
today we are very happy that the Government of Canada , the Government of Newfoundland and the private companies have developed those significant amounts of jobs in Eastern Canada .
the Deputy Speaker :
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Deputy Speaker :
the question is on the motion .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
an hon. member :
on division .

customs ACT
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to talk today about Bill C - 18 .
it will help our customs officers at the border points .
here we do the primary immigration and the customs work and now , with Bill C - 18 , we have the opportunity to fill a gap in the legislation that has been there for some time .
we have very much our own customs unions on side with us .
all of these interest groups have pointed out to us something that we do that had to be corrected .
they are our customs officers at the border points .
now , with this legislation , they will have the ability to put charges down where we suspect some criminal activity that was outside the parameters of the Customs Act and the other legislation that we cover at the border points .
they would then come and we could hold them , but we did not have the legal right to hold them there forever .
now this gap has been closed because we can do those charges .
we can also pick up the outstanding arrest warrants that come up with our intelligence systems at the border points .
it will be very material and will touch the lives of Canadians who fear children being abducted at the border points .
we have very good lookouts and intelligence .
this will give them the added legal authority to make the necessary charges on those involved in suspected criminal activities .
it is a very necessary piece of legislation .
my colleagues across the hall in this Chamber understand the need for this legislation and welcome it , as we do .
it is very important to the men and women who daily serve us in our department and who serve Canadians in doing their very important jobs .
they have been doing their jobs without this legislation but this clarifies in law and better allows them to complete the task .
they will have the adequate necessary training .
we will start at selected points but it will be across this land .
we will have to make some structural changes in some of our facilities to accommodate this situation but they are minor in the scope of things .
we do not believe our customs officers need to be armed at our border points and we will not be arming them , although I know this was part of the discussion .
this decision was taken after much investigation .
we will ensure the safety of our customs officers .
we have been dealing professionally with this situation for a long time .
now we are giving our customs officers the tool that was needed to close that legal gap , to give them the power to charge individuals and detain them .
the local police will be called in and they will take over as quickly as possible but we will legally be in a position to fulfill the need for community safety at the point of entry .
i remember a time when individuals such as Jonathon Yeo were seen at our border points and there was limited ability to hold them .
this will correct our situation .
i can think of tales from across Canada of people not being able to detain those they suspected of drinking and then later those people getting into accidents .
the safety of not only our peace officers but of Canadians is the number one area we are concerned with in this piece of legislation .
from a report of many years ago have come discussions with our unions , the public and within the department .
now we have this legislation .
we hope that with the assistance of all members in this House it can be moved rapidly through all legislative stages with the appropriate amount of discussion in this Chamber .
it will be sent to the justice committee , then at third reading we will have another level of discussion in the Chamber .
we in Revenue Canada are very proud of the men and women who serve us at the border .
the percentage of complaints we get about these individuals is very low compared to the number of people and goods they process .
it is a very low annual figure .
as a student customs officer at the border in 1974 I feel there are jobs that both full time and part time employees did which they will continue to do .
my point about the students is that they will not get training in this area .
we feel it is an area in which the full time and the full part time people should be trained in .
there will have to be sufficient numbers trained in this area of the law and procedure .
they will be properly staffed at every border point so that we can continue to do the excellent job that we are doing now for Canadians .
i wanted to make that point because even though we value every employee , full , part time , student , whatever , we recognize that these are skills positions , positions of authority .
we want them to be carried out in the most professional manner .
we will provide the facilities and the training so that our customs officers can do this across the land .
i want to highlight the fact that we have not gone so far as arming and we will not be doing this .
we have given the legal tool that was missing .
this is a very important piece of legislation .
it is one that has been long awaited .
i am very pleased .
it is not a long piece of legislation .
it is not a difficult piece of legislation .
the bottom line is that it will make a big difference for the people who work every day at our border points .
i am open to questions from my colleagues on my side or across the floor and I will do my best to answer their questions or concerns .
i am grateful that we are now in a position to put this piece of legislation before them .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on behalf of the official opposition to do something I thought I would never do in this House and have not done to this time , support a government bill .
it is not easy to do but for a good cause we will sometimes support government bills .
what Bill C - 18 does , as the hon. parliamentary secretary outlined , is extend the ordinary powers of peace officers to detain and to arrest people who are either under criminal warrants or suspected of engaging in certain forms of criminal activity , principally impaired driving .
this is something which is most sensible .
the notion that several thousand impaired drivers cross our borders each year but cannot be detained by our custom officers is a troubling one .
there are many customs and entry ports in this country where we do not have full time regular peace officers , RCMP officers , staffing those ports .
the customs agents are the only official representatives of our government and are the only eyes that are watching what kind of people cross those borders .
for these customs agents not to have the capacity to stop , detain and arrest people suspected of driving on to our highways impaired and endangering law abiding Canadian drivers I think is troubling .
we understand that over the past year , according to estimates made by our customs officers , over 8,500 suspected impaired drivers have entered Canada .
none of these people could be detained or stopped legally by customs agents for impaired driving .
there are other reasons why they could be stopped , but not necessarily for that offence .
there have been an estimated 200 incidents of suspected child abduction where customs agents have not been empowered to stop the alleged abductors of children .
there have been over 2,000 individuals subject to arrest warrants and more than 500 individuals in possession of suspected stolen property , mostly vehicles , again in instances where our customs agents have not been able to detain these people .
this is a sensible approach and one which we understand is supported by , among other groups , the customs union , Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination , CAVEAT , and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association , as well as various police forces .
it seems to have a broad range of support both by those concerned about the potential for the overzealous use of peace officer force as well as the police officers themselves .
they all seem to be in support of this bill .
however , we do have several questions which are not addressed in the information the government has provided with respect to Bill C - 18 and which were not really explained adequately by the parliamentary secretary .
among other questions , the government clearly will incur costs to implement this bill , costs which will derive from the training of customs agents so that they will know how and under what circumstances they may exercise these new criminal law powers .
what exactly are those costs for training those public servants in this respect ?
there will also be costs associated with establishing new facilities , detention facilities at many ports of entrance .
again , we have seen no estimate of what costs are associated with that .
i would therefore ask the hon. members opposite , perhaps the parliamentary secretary if she has an opportunity , to provide this House with information on what costs will be associated with this bill .
another question we have is the question of how these officers will be empowered to enforce the law .
we understand , as the hon. parliamentary secretary just admitted , that they will not be issued firearms .
while we are giving them in this bill partial police officer powers , the power to arrest and detain , among other people , suspected gun smugglers and drug smugglers , we will be issuing them pepper spray and , I gather , batons to protect themselves and Canadians and to enforce the law against potentially violent law breakers .
it seems to me this raises a question about the safety of our customs officers and the seriousness that the government has in terms of empowering these officers to apply and enforce the law .
i do not understand why the former minister of revenue , the current minister of Indian affairs , introduced substantially the same bill in the last Parliament .
in justifying not issuing firearms to these officers she simply said that she did not feel it was appropriate .
she did not really explain why .
she just said " Under my watch they will not be armed .
as far as guns , the message there changes the whole perspective of our border and the risk of increased violence is not acceptable to me '' .
if these agents were properly empowered and issued firearms , the risk of violence would not , I think , come from them .
the risk of violence comes from violent criminals who cross our borders .
to suggest that peace officers who are issued the necessary tools to do their jobs somehow poses a threat of violence at our borders is , I think , a rather backward way of looking at it .
it is those peace officers who use those tools who prevent violent criminals coming into Canada .
i would again ask for a more compelling justification for these peace officers ' not being issued with the appropriate tools to do the job that most peace officers have .
we also wonder about the common practice at Customs Canada of employing student customs officers .
these student officers are in some places such as Pearson airport .
some 80 % of customs agents , the first line of defence Canada has in the protection and enforcements of its laws , are undertrained student agents and are not full - fledged customs officers .
we understand that in other jurisdictions such as the United States and the United Kingdom this simply is not the case .
one hundred per cent of the customs agents representing those governments are fully trained , fully empowered , fully certified customs agents , and not quasi - customs agents .
i have another question for the government .
why does it continue to staff our borders with people who are not fully trained officers of the law ?
that is a reasonable question .
these student agents will not have the powers given to full customs agents under Bill C - 18 .
if student agents are on duty at a particular port of entry and find somebody who may be suspected of criminal activity , a suspected child abductor , kidnapper , smuggler of contraband or an impaired driver , they can do nothing to arrest or detain those people .
they had better hope that there is a full - fledged customs agent immediately available to them or a full - fledged peace officer .
if there is not then there is no protection for Canadians and there is no discharging of Canadian law at those ports of entry .
that is an important point to us .
i have another question .
the revenue minister has not indicated whether or not there will be additional training or the extent to which there will be additional training for newly empowered customs officers .
what kind of training will they receive ?
how do we know they will be properly trained to exercise the ultimate power of government , that is its police power ?
that question is not outlined .
i do not understand in a very sensible bill like this one why the government would not anticipate some of these questions and answer them .
perhaps it will in the course of this debate .
i would only ask why this kind of legislation was not passed years if not decades ago .
why does it take so long for us to plug loopholes in terms of enforcing the criminal law in Canada ?
why have we allowed 8,500 suspected impaired drivers to cross our borders in the past without having the power to stop them ?
how many innocent Canadians have died on Canadian roads because customs officers were not able to stop , detain or arrest suspected impaired drivers ?
those are good questions .
they are not only directed to this government but to predecessor governments as well .
in conclusion , the position of the Reform Party with respect to impaired driving and the application of the criminal law is well known .
we stand for a criminal law regime which can be enforced .
we want our peace officers and officers of the government to be able to enforce laws and protect Canadians .
a couple of weeks ago our party introduced a motion in this place calling for stiffer penalties for impaired driving .
any effort which can potentially remove even one impaired driver from our roads and can make society even incrementally safer is one that my party will support .
routine PROCEEDINGS
settlement AGREEMENT
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
yesterday in the House the hon. member for Elk Island said in part :
- during the question period the Deputy Prime Minister referred to and read from a document .
i believe under the standing orders he is required to table that document .
we request that he do so .
in response to that request from the Reform Party I would like to seek unanimous consent of the House to enable me to table the document at this time rather than this afternoon at the usual point in Routine Proceedings .
furthermore , if the House agrees , I would be happy to agree not only to table the document but to have it printed as an annex to today ' s Hansard .
the Deputy Speaker :
is the House agreeable to having the document printed as an annex to today ' s Hansard as suggested by the Deputy Prime Minister ?
some hon. members :
agreed .

government ORDERS
customs ACT
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , some days are busier than others .
today , I was in a building on Wellington Street to attend a sitting of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights , but I insisted on rushing back here to speak on Bill C - 18 , an Act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code .
these are extremely important amendments .
this bill , which was tabled by the Minister of National Revenue , affects several facets of law .
there is one entire section that deals with the changes and enhanced powers the government wishes to give customs officers .
this is not a new bill , however .
it is numbered C - 18 , but it was tabled in exactly the same form during the 35 th Parliament as C - 89 .
it will be remembered that it was tabled by the government of the day on the eve of the calling of the federal election , on March 13 , 1997 .
during the first mandate , a number of groups came to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights as well as to the government calling specifically for the government to change certain provisions of the Customs Act in order to enhance some powers .
a number of groups have long pointed out the need for customs officers to be able to enforce criminal law at Canadian entry points .
in a country like Canada , especially , which has such a long border with a lot of entry points , offences have occurred over the years , and customs officers lacked the tools necessary to deal with them .
what provision does the Customs Act make at the moment ?
we are told that customs officers have powers , but they are enforcement powers as established under part VI of the Customs Act .
these powers apply to surveillance duties and to the control of merchandise imported into or exported from Canada .
they include the power to search a person in order to find proof of an offence and to inspect , detain or seize merchandise .
currently customs officers ' powers apply primarily to merchandise entering or leaving Canada .
under these circumstances , customs officers are invested with the powers granted peace officers under sections 462.3 and 462.32 to 462.5 of the Criminal Code .
in short , at the moment , customs officers are considered peace officers under the Criminal Code only in the case of offences set out in the Customs Act .
the bill is proposing to amend the Customs Act to set out new offences that come under the powers of customs officers .
they really want to use the bill to give the customs officers greater opportunity to intervene when they witness certain offences .
let us be clear about the changes .
at present , customs officers are only allowed to act when an offence under the Customs Act has been committed .
since they do not have jurisdiction over Criminal Code offences or impaired driving offences - we will come back to that later , because there are specific provisions on this - they cannot act in those instances .
there has been in the past striking examples of cases where blatant irregularities took place at Canadian ports of entry and departure because customs officers did not have the power to act .
bill C - 18 proper contains four clauses .
these are small technicalities , but I think they are worth mentioning anyway .
clause 1 , which makes substantive changes to the Customs Act , is the bill ' s main provision , while clauses 2 and 3 amend two sections of the Criminal Code ; these amendments , although minor , are nevertheless far - reaching in terms of the customs officers ' jurisdiction .
finally , clause 4 is the usual provision dealing with the coming into force of the bill .
this new part is entitled " Enforcement of Criminal Offences Other than Offences under this Act '' .
this is reassuring , since it is an important power .
it will only be given to customs officers on duty at Canadian ports of entry .
the certificates of designation will be issued by the minister .
as will be seen later , we have some concerns .
while we support the bill as a whole , as we did during the 35 th Parliament , we do have concerns regarding the certificates of designation .
these are very important sections .
as you know , section 495 gives a peace officer the right to arrest without a warrant a person who has committed an indictable offence or is about to commit such an offence .
section 495 also provides that this power can only be exercised under exceptional circumstances , that is when the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that public interest requires such an intervention .
under section 497 , a peace officer who makes an arrest without a warrant must release the person arrested as soon as practicable , unless he has reasonable grounds to believe - this is another well - known legal concept - that it is necessary in the public interest to detain that person .
it is to be noted that these new powers can only be exercised in a customs office .
so , while additional powers are given to customs officers , the bill restricts their use and relies on well - known legal concepts .
these concepts are also recognized in case law and , over the years , they have been interpreted under a number of acts , including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Quebec charter .
the expression " reasonable grounds to believe " has indeed been interpreted .
the additional powers given to customs officers come with certain obligations .
in the final part of my speech , I will comment on the obligations that will apply to customs officers as a result of these amendments .
bill C - 18 , an act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code , contains an extremely important provision .
i must say that I am very happy to see that the lawmakers have included a provision to amend the Criminal Code accordingly through the Customs Act .
this provision can be found in proposed paragraph 163.5 ( 2 ) .
it would give designated customs officers - the same officers just designated by the minister - the powers and obligations of a peace officer under sections 254 and 256 of the Criminal Code .
what are sections 254 and 256 of the Criminal Code ?
as everyone knows , I am sure , these are the sections having to do with impaired driving .
these provisions are for the taking of breath or blood samples in cases of impaired driving .
thus , where a peace officer believes on reasonable and probable grounds - again , the same principle of law recognized by lawyers - that a person is committing or has committed the offence of driving while impaired as described in section 253 , that officer may , under the provisions of another section , section 254 ( 3 ) , require that person to provide him with a sample of the person ' s breath or , in certain circumstances , blood .
in the past , when a person who was driving into or out of Canada had alcohol on his breath , the customs officer to whom that person made his declaration could do absolutely nothing about it .
Mr. Speaker , as an Ontario MP , you are well aware that the biggest port of entry between the USA and Canada is Windsor .
with this amendment , in the form of subsection 163.5 ( 2 ) ,
customs officers will have additional powers and will be able to require individuals to provide a breath sample .
their actions will have legal consequences , eventually .
i find this reassuring , that customs officers ' powers are being enhanced within very definite limits .
these are very clearly delineated powers .
the customs officers ' powers do not replace those of the police officers of a province , nor those of the RCMP in provinces served by the RCMP .
the purpose of this is to prevent customs officers from searching for evidence of other criminal activities .
with this clause too , the lawmaker has imposed certain limits on customs officers , that is , a customs officer witnessing an offence will be empowered when this bill is passed to investigate and gather evidence of what he has seen .
if he has reasonable grounds to believe that an individual is , for example , moving stolen goods from Canada to the United States , he has , under the legislation and if there are reasonable grounds to believe the goods are in the trunk of a car , the power to examine the items in order to gather evidence to hand over to the police with jurisdiction where the customs officer made the seizure or conducted his investigation .
so , as we can see , there are limits , which are extremely important .
substantial additional powers , essentially the powers of peace officers , cannot be given to customs officers without limits being set , without very precise limits to ensure that everything occurs according to the intent of the bill .
i will raise certain points , which , at the time , gave me cause for considerable thought and also convinced me of the merits of such amendments .
in 1995 , a study revealed that , in 17 months , there were over 4,000 instances where criminal law could have been applied in one way or another at 160 ports of entry either on the highways or at airports .
according to Revenue Canada officials , the majority of these are suspected instances of impaired driving .
in these 4,000 cases , no action was taken because customs officers did not have the jurisdiction to act .
the same study shows that an amendment to the Customs Act similar to the one contained in Bill C - 89 - at the time , we were considering Bill C - 89 , tabled on March 13 , 1997 - would fill the gap between the time when customs officers observe a Criminal Code offence and the time when the police can respond .
it was clear from the statistics and from past experience that there was indeed a loophole allowing law - breakers to get off scot - free .
this bill bridges the gap to correct this shortcoming and ensure that offenders are prosecuted .
given the foregoing , we must recognize that the Criminal Code could be much more effectively enforced at our borders if our customs officers were given the appropriate tools .
however , while public safety may demand that we support the bill before us , some aspects will definitely have to be looked into at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights .
there are concerns regarding this bill .
i will mention four points .
the first one is the need to properly train the designated officers .
as I explained at the beginning of my speech , in some situations and under specific circumstances , customs officers will have basically the same powers as peace officers do , and these powers are very important ones .
it must be realized that in fact the bill proposes a significant broadening of the customs officers ' responsibilities .
take , for example , the expression " reasonable grounds to believe '' , which I pointed out earlier .
this subjective belief on the part of the police officer must also be justifiable from an objective point of view .
in order to properly interpret the clues that will influence his subjective belief , a peace officer must have received adequate training .
we also have to determine whether or not customs officers should be armed to implement these new provisions .
here again , if it is felt that the implementation of Bill C - 18 would require customs officers to be armed , then public safety will also require that customs officers have the necessary certificates authorizing them to handle firearms .
so , yes , there are additional powers , and , yes , we are in agreement .
however , if the job is to be well done , if we want to prevent myriad interpretations and court challenges , designated customs officers will need appropriate training .
they will perhaps need a basic knowledge of the legal concept of reasonable and probable grounds in order to be able to apply the legal principle .
and if these officers - because this question has not yet been resolved - are armed , as are officers of the peace , then they will also have to have the necessary certificates authorizing them to handle these firearms .
my second question concerns the need to cooperate with provincial authorities .
the bill would bridge the gap that existed between a customs officer ' s observation of an offence and police intervention .
for this gap to be satisfactorily bridged , it must be possible to count on the cooperation of provincial public security services .
it must be remembered - and it is good to remember this from time to time - that the administration of justice comes under provincial jurisdiction and that enforcement of the Criminal Code is thus a provincial responsibility .
although the new provisions would be implemented strictly in the context of federal customs responsibilities , consultations with the provinces would be appropriate .
if we want the amendments to Bill C - 18 to be useful , if we want to avoid , once again , at this stage , the problems caused by overlap and unfairness at the enforcement level or to avoid jurisdictional squabbles , it is really essential at this time that the federal government , perhaps through the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights - we will surely be hearing witnesses from the police forces - sit down at the same table and find an approach to ensure mutual co - operation .
another issue I am concerned with is costs .
there must surely be costs related to these changes , for example merely in terms of equipping all customs facilities with cells .
people cannot simply be arrested and placed at a table somewhere in the corner of some ordinary office .
if customs officers have the same powers as peace officers and police officers , and if they are going to arrest individuals who could be dangerous , their safety requires that there be proper facilities , cells like those in any police station .
we are told that there are about 80 border points .
what are the costs for these 80 stations ?
this is another question that remains unanswered at this time .
my fourth point concerns infringements of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
as we know , when additional powers are granted to customs officers to allow arrests without a warrant , it is possible that there will be violations to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
we must never forget that individuals have rights , including protection against arbitrary detention .
so we have to ensure that customs officers , when there are reasonable grounds to believe that an offence or other act has been committed , are adequately informed about the rights they might violate if they are not careful .
here again , we will have to be especially careful in terms of the education and training provided to the customs officers chosen by the minister .
in the charter alone , we find sections 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 , which are extremely important , and customs officers will have to enforce this legislation properly to avoid any legal challenge under the charter .
hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wish to say a few words on this bill before the House today and indicate , first of all , the support of the New Democratic Party for the bill .
now the bill is back before the House today .
i hope it goes through the House , giving the customs officers the power to implement certain parts of the Criminal Code , mainly to detain or arrest until a police officer is able to come to the scene .
this is something which is needed in this country .
in other words , the customs officer becomes the first line of defence , when the customs officer obviously sees a drunken driver or someone else who is suspected of committing a criminal offence .
today the customs officers do not have that power .
in this country we have many border crossings and about 2,500 customs officers .
there is really a gap in the law which has allowed over the last number of years a number of people who are suspected to be committing a criminal act to get into the country .
i want to give some information which is relevant to the debate this morning .
according to Revenue Canada , in the last two and a half years or the last thirty months there have been about 8,500 suspected impaired drivers who have crossed Canadian borders .
they have been allowed to cross because customs officers do not have the power to detain or to arrest the person suspected of being impaired .
what a customs officer can do , under the law today , is call the local detachment of the RCMP or local police , which ever may be the nearest , and tell the police that there is a driver going through who is suspected of being impaired .
in many cases the driver is long gone before the police arrive .
revenue Canada believes that in the last 30 months about 8,500 impaired drivers have just simply driven away before police arrived or in some cases the police were not called because there was not point in doing so .
there have also been about 200 incidents of suspected child abductions allowed to cross the border because the border officials have no power whatsoever to arrest or detain these suspected kidnappers .
again I think that states very clearly why customs officers need additional powers .
there have also been over 2,000 individuals who were subject to arrest warrants who have crossed the border , again long gone before the police arrived .
there have been more than 500 individuals suspected to be in possession of stolen property , mainly vehicles , who have also crossed the border before police arrived .
i think there is an obvious gap in the law that must be rectified by Parliament .
it is because of those facts that I am pleased to offer support on behalf of our party to the very quick passage of Bill C - 18 .
this is something which is long overdue .
it should have been done a number of years ago .
i also want to add that I believe there is general support in the community for these kinds of powers .
i know that police associations , customs officers , the customs excise union or the union des douanes et accises are all very supportive of passage of this legislation .
i also want to give an example of what happens because customs officers do not have this power .
i have in my hand a letter which was written by a customs officer .
i do not want to put any names on the record but just read into the record an incident that occurred very recently on the night of October 3 , 1997 .
i believe this sums up the need for the legislation :
the night of October 3 , 1997 at the customs port of Windygates , Manitoba was a prime example of the need for customs inspectors to have the authority to detain impaired drivers .
at approximately 2156 hours two Canadian males on motorcycles arrived at the port , returning from a nearby U.S. bar .
one in particular displayed signs of impairment .
i know from experience that this man cannot be dissuaded from driving , as driving while impaired has been a regular occurrence for him .
due to the distances involved , I also know that the suspect can be home before the RCMP are able to get on the road and apprehend him .
consequently , these motorcyclists were allowed to proceed .
minutes later , while administering CPR to a man that is clearly beyond help , I wonder what I could have done to prevent this tragedy .
shortly thereafter , family members of the deceased arrived on the scene and I also had the dubious honour of informing them of their loss .
based upon previous encounters with [ this gentleman ] , I am convinced that there is nothing I could have said , and nothing I could legally do to stop him from proceeding down the road that night .
however , I am equally convinced that if customs inspectors had the authority to enforce the impaired driving laws , that this man would be alive today .
then he goes on to say that in light of this incident and other incidents that have happened across this country , he hopes that Parliament will expedite the passage of this bill .
i think that letter sums up the need for this bill better than any speech we can make in this House .
people have been killed because customs officers do not have the powers of arrest and detainment .
there are people who have actually killed others in traffic accidents because of the fact that they are driving impaired .
with that , I offer our support and hope the House will do this expeditiously .
i am sure that he will make sure that occurs this morning .
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is with great pleasure that I speak in this House today to express my support for Bill C - 18 , legislation that will enhance safety and security for all Canadians .
the bill will strengthen our customs officers role in law enforcement by extending the scope of their powers so that they can arrest and detain individuals suspected of committing offences under the Criminal Code .
as the Minister of National Revenue has pointed out , the legislation will close a longstanding gap in our ability to better control criminal activities such as impaired driving , child abduction and possession of stolen goods at the border .
it will also allow us to deal with individuals who are the subject of outstanding arrest warrants .
there is a clear need for customs officers to be able to stop criminals and suspected criminals at the border before they have a chance to enter this country .
British Columbia has many major borders which process travellers and commercial traffic coming to Canada .
much of the criminal activity observed by our customs officers is reported at the borders .
impaired driving continues to be a cause for concern .
those numbers are startling .
Canadians expect us to do what we can to keep this community safe .
bill C - 18 is one way that we can meet those expectations .
a modern customs organization is what we expect to have .
the department has adopted new technology and new techniques such as risk management to respond to the reality of facilitating trade and tourism .
the fundamental changes now under way in our customs program recognize that most clients obey the law .
revenue Canada takes its responsibility to protect Canadians seriously and it is my belief that Bill C - 18 serves as one more tool for modern customs organizations to fulfil their enforcement mandate .
customs officers already have the power to detain and arrest individuals suspected of offences under the Customs Act .
our officers already deal with offences as serious as the smuggling of drugs and weapons .
bill C - 18 will extend those powers to include Criminal Code violations .
it will allow customs officers to deal with crimes that are repugnant to most Canadians .
attached to that letter is a letter from a customs officer who works at the port of Windygates , Manitoba .
in it the officer recounts a recent experience he had with an obviously impaired motorcyclist .
unable to detain this individual , the officer had no choice but to let him proceed on his way .
one kilometre beyond the port the motorcyclist lost control and was killed .
in his letter this concerned customs officer pointed out that the ending of the story may have been different if he would have had the power to legally contain this motorcyclist .
bill C - 18 will allow customs officers to use their unique position at the border to act as a first response against crime .
this means that customs officers will be able to legally hold suspects until law enforcement agencies can intervene .
therefore , that will increase their chances of catching those people at the right time .
as we mentioned earlier , it will close a longstanding gap and will give customs officers a stronger role in law enforcement as they work in co - operation with police agencies across the country .
police officers , police chiefs , attorneys general all know that this will enhance our ability to catch criminals at the border .
giving customs officers more power will help the police to do their job more effectively .
the legislation has a broad base of support among the law enforcement community of this country .
we have consulted broadly with law enforcement agencies and officials and we have their support .
customs officers will not have the power to investigate Criminal Code offences , nor will customs officers have the power to prosecute Criminal Code offences .
that will remain the responsibility of provincial law enforcement agencies .
it is also not our intent to provide firearms to our officers as a result of this legislation .
we have studied this issue carefully and have concluded that it is not necessary .
we are entrusting these powers to a group of men and women who prove their value to this country every day as skilled , dedicated professionals .
in 1995 - 96 our customs officers processed over 106 million people at the border .
the department received only 448 complaints about the conduct of officers .
this represents a one - to - nearly 240,000 ratio .
i think those statistics speak very highly of the professionalism with which customs officers do their job .
once Bill C - 18 is passed it will take six to nine months to implement this initiative .
we will use that time to renovate facilities , designate officers and train them on the identification of Criminal Code offences and related court jurisprudence .
customs officers will have the training and tools they need to carry out their new duties in a professional and responsible manner .
Canadians can be assured that men and women who are paid to protect our border will continue to do so with the same skill and dedication that they have come to expect .
in conclusion , I urge my colleagues in the House to support Bill C - 18 .
i am sharing my time with a colleague , the member for Sarnia - Lambton .
Mr. Roger Gallaway ( Sarnia - Lambton , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to rise in support of Bill C - 18 which , as we know , will provide customs officers with the power to enforce the Criminal Code .
i should say that my riding is on the Ontario - Michigan border .
in fact , it records the third highest volume of border traffic on the Canada - U.S. border on the one side , Port Huron , Michigan and on the Canadian side at the village of Point Edward .
we have two bridges with six lanes of traffic coming and going through the country and some 6,000 trucks alone every day crossing both ways .
at the southern end of my riding is the Sombra crossing where there are tens of thousands of trucks and cars crossing each year .
we find that more and more Americans and others enter Canada through our entry ports , especially at southern Ontario .
this , as we know , represents trade and tourism for Canada .
however , as is always the case , with more traffic and people comes more problems .
occasionally individuals who are attempting to enter Canada have committed or are committing a criminal offence , individuals who are wanted for all kinds of criminal offences .
as more and more of these people enter they pose a risk to all Canadians .
we do not want these people entering our country .
we want to stop them .
however , the reality is that when very impaired drivers try to enter , the only thing customs officers can do is attempt to detain them until the local police arrive to lay charges and take them into custody .
for years the taxpayers in the village of Point Edward where I live have been subsidizing all Canadian taxpayers because it has been the police force in the village that has been called when there was a problem .
i have to ask why the taxpayers of one municipality should suffer financially by paying for local police because a border crossing happens to be located in that municipality .
this bill certainly goes a great distance in balancing that inequality .
statistics from all ports of entry indicate that there were 8,500 suspected impaired drivers who tried to enter Canada in a two and a half year period which is about 3,400 impaired drivers rolling into Canada from the U.S. each year .
in the past we had little or no opportunity to stop them or apprehend them .
we are told that each year there have been some 80 suspected child abductors , sad cases of people using children as pawns in illegal activities , rolling up to customs where little or nothing happens to detain or arrest them .
Canadians certainly welcome visitors to this country whether for pleasure or business , but no one wants impaired drivers to roll in or any individual who is being sought on a warrant by the police to just simply sail through our customs and enter the country .
it is , I can see , the strange dichotomy which at long last is being corrected by this bill .
this bill responds to three factors .
the first and the obvious is that those who are the first to have contact with individuals entering the country must have the right to detain and arrest those who may be committing a criminal offence or a person for whom there is an outstanding warrant .
second , we tend to forget that customs officers live in and are an important part of our communities .
they have been frustrated when they have been incapable of preventing persons alleged to have committed serious criminal offences entering our country .
this bill gives them the right and the authority to do what we want them to do and in fact what they want to do and that is detain suspected criminals .
third and finally , this bill takes pressure off local police to respond to border problems because local taxpayers have been subsidizing directly the policing function that ought to have been carried out by the federal government .
if anything , I suppose I can suggest that this legislation could go a step further and that is that the legislation as drafted would require that the prosecution of the offence be carried out by so - called provincial authorities .
in some jurisdictions where the RCMP are the provincial authorities the policing cost is divided 70 % by provincial payment and 30 % by federal payment .
this is clearly not the case in Ontario where the RCMP are not provincial authorities .
in British Columbia for example where the RCMP by agreement are provincial authorities referred to in the bill , the prosecution of border crossing offences are paid for out of the 30 % federal contribution , yet in Ontario it is a different situation .
one could ask , why should the taxpayers of Windsor who pay for local police pay for prosecutions of offences at , for example , the Ambassador Bridge or the Windsor - Detroit Tunnel .
i could say the same thing about the people in my riding .
i hope and trust that the standing committee will examine this issue in the bill and perhaps look at it more fully .
on the face of it I would suggest that allowing customs officers to prosecute as peace officers would recognize them totally and absolutely as such and would free up local police to deal with local problems and not problems associated with international trade and travel .
in conclusion , on balance I know that the people in my riding are pleased that the pressure is going to be taken off the local police .
i think Canadians should be pleased that customs officers are now going to be able to deal with those people who for various reasons are coming into our country and we do not want them to come in because they are impaired or because they have committed offences for which there are outstanding warrants .
as such I think this is a good piece of legislation .
it is an important piece legislation .
i believe it deserves the support of this House .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today in the House of Commons to speak on this particular piece of legislation , Bill C - 18 , an act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code .
it is in fact a very timely piece of legislation .
i would go so far as to say that it is a good initiative .
i am encouraged to see the government bringing this legislation forward .
it deals specifically , as previous members have mentioned , with the power to enforce Criminal Code sections as they pertain to powers of arrest at the border crossings or the first point of entry for persons coming into the country .
as previously stated this piece of legislation is aimed at increasing the powers of customs officers themselves in their ability to arrest without a warrant and to release from custody in cases where an arrest has been effected without the warrant from a peace officer being involved .
the peace officers themselves I would suggest would be greatly aided by the ability of the border crossing guards or the customs officers being able to effect this duty independent of the involvement of the police here .
i spoke in the House previously , as have other members , with respect to the difficulties Canadians face daily on the roads and the carnage that results from impaired driving .
it is a very legitimate purpose that customs officers would have the ability to make that intervention and to effect an arrest .
this is not to say that the age old common law powers of arrest and a person ' s ability to make a citizen ' s arrest could not have been utilized , but this certainly legislates it and empowers customs officers specifically in this regard .
designated officers at customs stations and border crossings also encounter a fair degree of danger as it pertains to the illegal importation of weapons into the country and often cases involving the importation of drugs and banned or illegal substances .
it is trite to say that persons who are prepared to take these risks are often individuals who could be described as desperate in some circumstances .
customs officers are basically in the line of fire when they discover a person may be in possession of illegal substances , illegal handguns or other items .
they are in a position of confronting the individual at the border , which can lead to a dangerous situation .
i am sure this will be discussed at the committee level .
i speak specifically of such things as the right to carry firearms and the right to wear protective body armour like a flak jacket or a bulletproof vest .
this has to be given more thought .
to simply empower customs officers to make these arrests and to intervene more at Canadian borders is a good idea in principle which I and my Conservative Party colleagues endorse and encourage , but we have to be very careful when we empower people to give them adequate protection .
there is some irony in the timing of the bill .
apparently the government did not feel this was a proper initiative and failed to support it .
i have heard other members refer to increased traffic at our borders .
this has been taken into account .
it is an important factor when one considers the amount of traffic that flows daily back and forth across our various border crossing points .
we enjoy the largest unguarded border in the world between Canada and the United States , which is by far our biggest trading partner .
that is certainly beneficial to this country .
the implementation of the new powers of arrest for customs officers is very much a good thing .
it will allow customs officers to carry out their daily tasks more effectively .
one of the most positive elements of Bill C - 18 would be to add a section to the act that would allow customs officers to handle impaired drivers in the same manner as peace officers .
this will perhaps lessen the workload of some local constabularies whether the RCMP or the municipal police .
i noted with great interest the possibility of including in the ability of a provincial prosecution office the additional duty of handling the types of cases that would be brought forward by customs officers .
that is something that could be explored .
i would suggest to the House based on my experience that provincial prosecution offices , much like the offices of the municipal and RCMP forces , are very much weighted down already .
the downloading of this on to provincial crown offices is not something that should be entered into lightly as an initiative by the federal government .
it is certainly something that could be looked at in the sense that it would be done on a per diem basis or contracted to various provincial offices .
with respect to impaired driving I can only reiterate comments I have made in the House .
my party and I support tougher drunk driving measures .
bill C - 18 is important because it gives customs officers an effective interventionist role in combating impaired driving within Canada .
generally speaking the feedback I have received on this initiative is positive .
customs officers are embracing the initiative and are prepared to act in this new found role .
another section of Bill C - 18 , however , clearly states that designated officers may not use their new found responsibilities to engage in the sole purpose of searching for evidence .
this might be a reasonable limitation .
when bestowing the powers of arrest and intervention on customs officers , we have to be very careful when it involves an infringement for the sole purpose of gathering evidence .
the final portion of the bill deals with proposed amendments to the Criminal Code to ensure it corresponds with new sections of the Customs Act .
i have a few concerns about the impact of Bill C - 18 .
perhaps the minister or parliamentary secretary could provide further details on how the government plans to address potential problems .
will customs officers be able to respond adequately to the emergency type situations I referred to earlier ?
there are sensitive areas when a customs officer encounters a person engaged in an illegal activity or engaged in an offence under the Criminal Code for impaired driving .
there will have to be an allocation of funding and a commitment to increase resources as they relate to the training of customs officers and how to deal with the new powers bestowed upon them .
i would be very much interested to see what commitment we will have from the federal government to adequately arm and protect customs officers in their desire to combat crime at Canadian borders .
i have a concern with respect to granting customs officers the ability of peace officers to avoid providing additional resources to municipal and federal police forces .
i do not think that is the intent of the legislation .
i do not think that there is an attempt to take powers away from police officers .
i would not want to see the reason given that no increased funding would be put into the area of expanding the availability of justices of the peace to assist police officers .
i would not want to hear that money could not be allotted for that because money was being put into the area of increased training , et cetera , of customs officers at our borders .
when customs officers are put in a position where they have to act like police officers and carry out the duties , it is extremely important they have the feeling and the assurance the federal government will give them the training and back - up they will need to perform that role .
while I support the legislation which will make the job of customs officers easier by granting them new authority , I do so on the premise the government will not give carte blanche to new obligations without proper support in terms of resources .
on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party , as I have said throughout my remarks , we support the legislation in principle .
i look forward to the opportunity of discussing further details and fine tuning the act at committee level .
it is a very important and timely piece of legislation .
many customs officers throughout the land have felt a need for the legislation for some time .
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( London West , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the member ' s speech and to other members who spoke this morning .
in my comments I want to address some of the very worthwhile questions posed by them .
by expanding the scope of powers for customs officers to include Criminal Code offences , I stress that we are not creating an extra police force .
it is a means of assisting police forces across the country .
it does not replace them in any way , shape or form .
the new powers designated to customs officers will be limited and specific , and there will be adequate training .
right now many custom facilities have secure rooms so a lot of infrastructure is in place .
earlier today there was a direct question from a member of the Reform Party on this cost .
it is not as large as one would expect because we already have most of the facilities in place now .
we are just upgrading and putting in facilities where needed .
it will probably be somewhere between six and nine months after the legislation is brought into law that training will be complete .
for the security and safety of our own officers and the public , obviously we will not move before everyone is properly trained and the facilities are in place .
i assure members opposite , the Canadian public and , most important , the men and women who work in our customs facilities that this will be the case .
what new powers ?
customs officials will have the power to detain and arrest individuals for Criminal Code offences which they encounter in the course of their regular duties .
maybe the hon. member would wish to respond .
i have more details if he wishes them .
Mr. Peter MacKay :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for her assurances and her remarks with respect to these new duties and the funding .
i think that is reassuring .
i do find it interesting that , at a time when we are increasing the powers and essentially expanding on the duties currently carried out by customs officers , I cannot help but draw an analogy with what is happening to our ports police .
again , this is a concern that I have .
i do not know that this is the proper forum to address that but I point that out to the hon. member .
again , I look forward to discussing it further with her and other members of the committee .
Mrs. Sue Barnes :
Mr. Speaker , having heard those comments I do wish to assure the member opposite that in this situation it is our people working at the border points who are also very anxious to have this legislation .
we are enhancing their role with their consent and also in support of them .
we are doing something that is beneficial to the people most directly involved as well as society as a whole .
maybe as an example that people would be able to understand , I will just show where the limitation would come in .
i will take the example of someone , a customs officer , encountering someone who looks impaired at a border point .
we are having our customs officers perform their functions at the border points only .
obviously between border points the RCMP , as it has always done , will be responsible for the security of our borders and will continue with its functions .
i think what we have here is a beneficial piece of legislation .
it is absolutely essential to us that we properly train and provide all the necessary tools and safety and security not only to the public but to people who are within our employ and who the department is responsible for .
we take that responsibility extremely seriously .
Mr. Peter MacKay :
Mr. Speaker , I am encouraged to hear again the reiteration that the training is going to be there specifically because again , calling on my own experience , impaired driving cases essentially thrown out of court or where problems arise are often at the early detention stage .
therefore for these customs officers who are encountering impaired drivers at the border , I am very encouraged to hear that they are going to be given a great deal of training in this area .
case law has been voluminous in this regard .
i am sure that all peace officers who receive this training are going to have to study this in a very comprehensive way .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal ( Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , before I start I want to thank my parliamentary secretary who has done a tremendous job in starting off the debate this morning on this bill .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Chair would beg the indulgence of the hon. minister .
the hon. minister is deemed to have spoken on the bill , having introduced the bill .
may we have unanimous consent for the Minister of National Revenue to speak to this bill ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal :
Mr. Speaker , I thank hon. members for giving me this opportunity to speak .
i know they believe that we should give all members an opportunity to speak in the House , particularly the Minister of National Revenue with such good news .
let me thank my parliamentary secretary who did an excellent job this morning in starting off the debate and speaking on my behalf as I was not able to be here .
she has a lot of experience in this area , being a former customs officer during the summers .
certainly she is very able to speak on this issue .
i am pleased to seek the approval in principle of the House for Bill C - 18 , which will give Revenue Canada ' s customs officers the additional power they need to enforce the Criminal Code at the border .
bill C - 18 is important for the protection of Canadians and Canada .
it closes an enforcement gap which restricts our officers from acting to control criminal activities such as impaired driving , child abduction and the possession of stolen goods at the border .
the bill also gives officers the authority to detain individuals who are the subject of outstanding arrest warrants .
in this regard Bill C - 18 is vital to our government ' s efforts to increase the safety of Canadians .
customs has always been vital to Canada ' s safety and prosperity .
today we have a customs administration which is allowing Canadians to seize the opportunities created by liberalized trade and travel while protecting us against threats to our social and economic well - being .
even before Confederation our customs officers were our first line of defence at the border .
in 1997 this is still a key part of their mandate .
however , like any modern organization , customs must change to reflect the realities of a more transient world , a world where crime has no borders .
that is why customs officers have always worked with the RCMP and other domestic and international law enforcement agencies to keep our communities and our streets safe .
we know that our position at the border gives us a unique advantage to identify and intercept criminals .
we want to take advantage of this unique position .
make no mistake , our customs officers do come face to face with crime at the border .
we have the numbers to prove it .
in the past 16 months our officers have seized over $ 850 million worth of drugs , almost $ 2 million worth of contraband alcohol and tobacco products , and more than 2,600 illegal imports of firearms .
day in and day out our customs officers do a magnificent job .
i am proud of the fact that Canada has one of the finest customs administrations in the world .
however , we want to give them the tools to do better .
that is why I am here today , to talk about this important piece of legislation which will help make our streets and our communities even safer .
we have a compelling argument why this legislation is needed .
we know that customs officers encounter criminal behaviour at the border which is outside the parameters of the Customs Act .
the fact that they cannot take appropriate action places all Canadians at risk .
i refer to a case involving Jonathon Yeo .
Mr. Yeo was refused entry to the United States because he was out on bail for a criminal offence .
as a Canadian citizen he was allowed to return to Canada because the officers did not have the authority to detain him .
Mr. Yeo went on to abduct and murder two young women before taking his own life .
bill C - 18 will provide our customs officers with the authority to detain and arrest individuals who are suspected of committing Criminal Code offences or other offences until local authorities arrive .
officers hands will no longer be tied when dealing with criminals .
this problem and the need for this bill is borne out by recent statistics , during the last two and a half years , at Canadian ports of entry .
customs officers have encountered over 8,500 suspected impaired drivers , almost 200 incidents of suspected child abduction , in excess of 2,000 individuals subject to arrest warrants , and more than 500 individuals in possession of suspected stolen property , mostly vehicles .
the police have a very strong working relationship with customs officers but they all agree that customs officers must be able to intervene effectively when they encounter Criminal Code offences .
this will make a tremendous difference to the enforcement of our Criminal Code at the border and as a result make for safer communities in this country .
bill C - 18 marks an important change in the role of customs officers .
this bill is a product of consensus .
everyone sees merit in it .
members across have spoken of the merits of this bill and are fully supportive .
in lobbying to strengthen the ability of our customs officers to deal with Criminal Code offences , we have the support of all the groups we consulted including the customs officers union , police at both the provincial and federal level , Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination , CAVEAT , Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the tourism industry association of Canada .
before the government settled on this course a number of alternatives were considered but were found to be either impractical or too costly .
again and again we kept coming back to one solution , to extend the scope of customs officers arrest powers .
the bill will change the scope but not the nature of the duties of our customs officers .
they currently have the powers to arrest for offences contained in the customs act .
this solution will expand the scope of these powers to include Criminal Code and other federal offences .
using this legislation we propose to provide customs officers with a first response capability at the border , allowing them to detain and arrest individuals who are suspected of having committed offences or who are in the process of committing offences under the Criminal Code .
this first response capability will bridge the gap between the time customs officers detect a Criminal Code offence and the time when the police can intervene .
a first response capability means Canadians can expect more effective and efficient enforcement of our criminal laws and customs officers can fulfill their protection role at the border .
a first response capability will strengthen an already strong partnership with the law enforcement community .
this bill is good news for all those who care about the safety of our communities .
these powers will enhance our contribution in the fight against crime .
for example , if a driver appears impaired the customs officer could administer the initial breath test .
if the roadside alert indicates a problem they would immediately turn the suspect over to the police for the administration of a formal breathalyser test .
customs officers can and will make a difference , a view also shared by the police community .
for example , Windsor police Deputy Chief Michael Dagley said of this bill : " It is a real plus because it means we are not out looking for the individual and they are in custody quicker '' .
we are not asking for sweeping powers .
customs officers will not be expected to participate in Criminal Code investigations or to transport prisoners .
customs officers will only be allowed to use these new powers while on duty at points of entry .
not all customs officers will be given this expanded power of arrest .
this broader role will only be carried out by designated customs officers who will be drawn from those who are in regular contact with the travelling public .
in practice , this will involve about 2,000 to 2,500 members of the current customs officers workforce .
Canadians can be assured that these designated customs officers will be trained to ensure that they act fairly , responsibly and within the confines of the law in carrying out their new duties .
this training will be coupled with a clear accountability structure which will outline situations calling for a first response action .
i would like to stress again that our officers and their unions support this course of action .
i have met with Mr. Moran and he has informed me that he has written to all members of Parliament asking them to support this bill .
i cannot deal with the issue of customs officers powers without addressing the very difficult issue of arming customs officers .
i am aware that some employees and indeed some members of the public , as has been expressed today , believe that customs officers should carry weapons for their personal protection .
we have considered these views very carefully .
however , it is the government ' s position that the introduction of firearms at the border is unnecessary and could lead to the escalation of violence instead of the resolution of differences .
customs officers carry out their jobs effectively without firearms and we have every reason to believe that this will continue .
therefore we will not arm Canadian customs officers .
in closing , I would like to summarize the changes this bill will bring about .
it will give customs officers the tools they need to enforce the Criminal Code at the borders .
it will correct an enforcement gap that is not acceptable to the public , local police agencies , victims rights groups or customs officers .
Mrs. Priscilla de Villiers , founder of Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination , CAVEAT , said in March : " Obviously we are very pleased that this gap has been closed '' .
individual Canadians will be provided with the type of protection that results in safe homes and communities .
it will reinforce Revenue Canada ' s commitment to protect the health and safety of Canadians .
i know Canada ' s customs officers can take up this new mandate and enforce the law wisely .
change is nothing new for the men and women of Revenue Canada .
i am confident that they will take these changes in stride and continue to embrace the role to protect our nation .
customs officers are eager and in fact impatient to get on with the job , to get the training that will equip them for the task ahead .
i am confident that the solution contained in Bill C - 18 will work and I am pleased to present it for the approval of my hon. colleagues in this Chamber .
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I appreciated the minister ' s speech and his exhortation that we would support the bill because he believes it is good for Canada .
however , before we decide on that I have a couple of questions regarding the men and women who are protecting our borders .
i understand that there are two categories , the ones who are trained and the ones who , shall we say , are less well trained .
i understand that the customs officers have to take a 14 week course , pass with at least a 70 % mark and then be subject to a one year probation before becoming a customs officer .
however , at the same time , we have others who have to take a two and a half week course without an exam and begin work immediately .
i would like the minister to confirm whether my facts are correct on that basis .
he said that the people who were going to be issued this certificate would be drawn from the people on the front lines .
i understand that these are younger people with less experience and less training who are the ones who are quite often on the front lines .
is it the people with the two and a half weeks of training and no exam who are going to be issued with the certificates or are the certificates designating these people with the enhanced powers going to be given only to those who have had the full training , passed the exam and the probation ?
are we going to let young people with two weeks training on the job run around arresting people ?
i would like to hear from the minister .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
i want to assure the hon. member that all those people who will be designated will have the full training .
as the hon. member knows , we have a number of people at customs who are students and work on a part time basis and on a summer basis .
i am very proud of the work we do to create this opportunity for students and young people .
the people who will get the designation will not be the students who are there on a part time or summer basis .
these will be people who are permanent and they will be designated .
as I said earlier , there will be 2,000 to 2,500 members across the country who will receive this training .
once they have fulfilled their training program and they are approved and passed , then they will be designated .
with that designation they will have the ability to respond and carry out the additional powers which we will give them .
i want to assure the member that they will be well trained and they will be required to fulfil their training and be examined before they are designated .
that is the whole purpose of designation .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate the hon. minister on his speech , much of which we can agree on but some of which we have some difficulty with .
i would like to also know what the hon. minister would like to do about that and whether or not he would like to entertain a discussion with the Minister of Justice on this particular and very serious issue .
we can give our customs officers all the powers that they can have but if they are not going to be allowed to enforce those powers and if they are being told by people higher up that they should not enforce those powers , that is a serious breach of justice within our country .
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member from Esquimalt .
i want to congratulate him on the good work that he did in the last Parliament on a variety of issues , including the land mine issue which he put a lot of work into .
i share the view of the member .
it is very important to protect our borders .
a number of initiatives were brought forward in the last Parliament .
one was the anti - smuggling initiative that we put forward to ensure that we protect our borders .
we are looking at smart borders by utilizing technology .
in the last few years we have invested a lot of money to ensure that we have increased the technology , to share the information with law enforcement officers domestically as well as internationally .
certainly that is a very important concern .
it is something that we as a government dealt with in the last Parliament as well , as the hon. member knows , in terms of trying to ensure that we have adjustment to our taxes to make sure that we have less contraband flowing across the border .
i think we are renowned around the world as having one of the best customs offices and some of the best people dealing with our borders .
the hon. member knows of course that we have the largest border of any two countries .
it is not easy to manage .
however , I think we are doing an excellent job in terms of the resources we have .
it is a priority for me to ensure that we protect our borders .
this is another example of our agenda to protect our communities and make our communities safer .
i think the hon. member will support this bill because it is very much of some of the things that he has talked about , to protect the safety of our communities and to protect our borders .
he can be assured that we will do everything possible to make sure that we reduce any contraband across the border .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have two questions for the minister with respect to this bill .
first , I asked during my remarks on the bill if the government had made an estimate as to the incremental cost to be incurred by the department in training these newly empowered customs agents to act as quasi - peace officers and furthermore what the cost of upgrading any facilities might be .
i inferred from the parliamentary secretary ' s comments that there was not clear estimate of the costs and that there were some facilities in place .
it is reasonable of the opposition and of all Canadians to expect the government to have some sense of what the incremental cost of a legislative change is going to be .
that question has not yet been answered either from the information provided by the minister ' s department or by him or the government speakers in debate on this bill .
that is my first question .
the second question concerns the basis on which the minister decided these newly empowered customs agents will not be issued firearms to properly discharge their new responsibilities .
does he think that a customs agent can stop , detain and arrest a gun smuggler or a drug smuggler or a child abductor or a kidnapper with pepper spray and a baton ?
why is he not prepared to give those customs agents what they need to protect themselves , to protect Canadians and to enforce our laws ?
hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal :
she said that the cost was $ 5.5 million and if the member read Hansard he would find that out .
clearly there is a cost to upgrade some facilities .
we already have a number of facilities to detain individuals but there are areas we need to upgrade .
both the upgrade in some infrastucture and the training will be $ 5.5 million .
i have stated this figure in a number of previous speeches .
if the member were reading his press clippings he would clearly understand that .
perhaps the hon. member does not know this .
he should know that under the customs act we are already doing that .
this is an increase in expanding powers under the Criminal Code .
we are doing what we can of the things he has talked about .
it is under the customs act .
if he reads the act it will be very clear to him that those already exist and we are taking those responsibilities .
as I mentioned in my speech , I have not seen a need to arm our officers .
maybe that was the point the hon. member was making .
we do not feel it is necessary .
we will provide that option to them .
we are looking for the best product available to provide to our officers .
this will be good for the officers .
i have read of a number of groups that are supportive .
this is a good bill that should be supported by all members of the House .
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I acknowledge our thanks and our indebtedness to our customs people who defend our borders .
they work very hard and diligently to ensure they do the best they can to uphold the laws of Canada , to defend our borders and to ensure our country is safe from as many drugs and illicit contraband as possible .
the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue said this is a very small bill but provides a great deal of benefit .
my first reaction to that comment is that after four years why is it so late if it is such a small bill that provides such a great benefit to this country .
we will leave that for the parliamentary secretary and the minister to explain at a later date .
these small changes are a step in the right direction but I have some serious concerns about the training of many of the people who we ask to defend our borders .
i understand that many people involved have very little training .
after two and a half weeks I am surprised that they even know the names of the pieces of legislation , let alone the contents .
but there we have it .
the minister assures us that he is doing his job well .
i wonder whether the minister really understands these powers and has a full complement of people who are fully trained to do this .
if they represent 80 % that means we are pretty thin on the ground with full time , well trained people .
i wonder whether there is actually enough staff to be able to ensure that the job is being done properly .
if he is talking about drawing 2,000 people and licensing them according to this act , bearing in mind the number of ports that we have to man , I think it would be incumbent upon the minister to assure the House that there is no problem about the adequacy of staffing to ensure that it can be done .
if we are talking about arresting those who are impaired or appear to be impaired and those who may be involved in abductions and so on , I can very , very easily see that they could become violent .
with the small number of fully trained customs officers , I wonder if we are placing some of these people in some danger in the event that an issue does become quite violent .
no doubt one day it will happen and we will look back and say " Why did we not provide the adequate detention facilities and adequate staff for the proper arrest to be made '' .
i would like the minister to think about that .
my colleague from Calgary Southeast asked the minister about the news item regarding drug smuggling across the St. Lawrence River with seeming impugnity .
i think we need to address that .
i have seen on television where at night in the winter there are skidoos and other vehicles crossing the St. Lawrence River and not in any way being apprehended by anybody , police officers , peace officers or customs officers or anyone else .
according to the television clip that I saw , there was a significant amount of gunfire at the same time .
it sounded like a pretty lawless place .
that happens to be in your neck of the woods , Mr. Speaker .
i would hope that something would be done about it , taking it up with the minister to ensure that we can fully protect our borders .
in closing , again to paraphrase the words of the parliamentary secretary , it is a small bill , it is a big benefit .
the Reform Party is pleased to support it and we certainly hope that it will go a long way toward improving the safety of Canadians , improving the integrity of our borders and ensuring that Canada is a safe place and not a safe haven .
Mr. John Maloney ( Erie - Lincoln , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to rise this afternoon to speak on this legislation .
i think it is important at the outset to look at some of the figures involving the background of this legislation .
these statistics are very disturbing .
although customs officers reported these incidents to local authorities , the police were only able to apprehend a few suspects .
this fact is most disturbing .
these incidents occur at most land , air and marine ports of entry , with about 80 % located on highways , 10 % at airports that handle international traffic and 10 % at seaports .
i am very pleased to rise this afternoon to speak on Bill C - 18 , an act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code , a bill that will make these statistics a thing of the past .
this is a piece of legislation that is truly very near and dear to my heart and to the many customs officials that work the front line at the Peace Bridge border crossing in Fort Erie in my riding of Erie - Lincoln .
after my election in 1993 , I was approached by the local customs union representatives about the difficulty in apprehending impaired drivers at the Fort Erie - Buffalo crossing .
in fact , I attended at the border and observed their observations and even stood out at the primary inspection line and observed the cars coming across .
there have been several incidents in my riding and the customs officers were rightfully frustrated that they did not have the power to detain suspected drunk drivers until the local police could intervene .
the standard operating procedure at that time was to let the driver through and notify the local police , hoping and sometimes praying that they would catch up with any impaired individuals .
this was unsatisfactory .
in fact , it was shocking .
most people in my riding just could not comprehend this .
this was unsatisfactory .
the course of action that was followed was far too dangerous for our border communities and too many times resulted in an accident before the driver could be apprehended .
my customs officers told me that this had to change and I agreed with them .
in 1995 , an in - depth study of officers ' powers confirmed this and concluded that the existing situation was unacceptable .
the study proposed an extension of customs officers ' powers to include Criminal Code offences .
support for this idea came from groups such as Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating its Termination , which we have come to know as CAVEAT , police forces , Revenue Canada , employees , the customs excise union and the general public in my riding of Erie - Lincoln .
in 1995 , I began to prepare a private members ' bill on this issue .
i met with some of the stakeholders , including the customs excise union president at that time , discussed how this issue should be addressed and what the best course of action would be .
around this time I was informed by my colleague , the former minister of revenue , that the department was also looking to resolve this problem by amending the Customs Act and the Criminal Code .
this government listened .
the result was Bill C - 89 that was tabled this past March .
this legislation , as many of you know , unfortunately died in the Order Paper in April .
over the course of the summer I was pleased to learn from our new minister of revenue that reintroducing this legislation was a priority .
on October 30 he fulfilled that commitment .
i congratulate him for the expeditious manner in which this important bill was reintroduced .
under the proposed legislation , customs officers will be provided a first response capability at the border with the power to detain or arrest individuals suspected of having committed offences which fall under the Criminal Code , such as impaired driving or child abduction .
the intent of the legislation is to bridge the gap between the time customs officers detect a Criminal Code offence and the time when the police can arrive to intervene .
provincial authorities will continue to be responsible for prosecuting individuals for Criminal Code offences at the border .
customs officers encounter criminal behaviour at the border that is outside the parameters of the Customs Act and the fact that they cannot take appropriate action places all Canadians at risk .
this legislation will correct an enforcement gap which is not acceptable to the public , local police agencies , victims ' rights groups or customs officers .
i believe that these changes will result in safer communities , but above all they will help to contribute to long term public protection .
i understand that once the bill receives royal assent it could take six to nine months to implement this initiative and that customs officers will be trained to ensure that they act fairly , responsibly and within the confines of the law in carrying out their new duties .
current training programs will require changes and no customs officer will be permitted to carry out the first response function until he or she has received and passed the appropriate training .
this is not an entirely new function because customs officers are already designated as peace officers for the purposes of the Customs Act .
they already undergo extensive training on search , seizure and arrest .
customs officer training also includes instruction on the charter and its implications in exercising the powers of search and arrest .
i understand that plans are under way to introduce training on the use of force for personal protection and to compel compliance with the law .
no customs officer should be put in the position of having to carry out this or any other function without appropriate training .
i urge the government to carefully plan this training as it is crucial for the customs officers to have adequate education and training .
they want nothing less and our border communities demand nothing less .
it is said that the additional responsibilities will only be given to officers who deal directly with individuals seeking entry into Canada .
this will involve about 2,500 members of the current customs officer workforce of 3,200 .
i am pleased to note that it will not include any student customs officers .
many young people in my riding have part time or summer jobs at customs and , realistically , do not have the experience or the time to be properly trained for this function .
we certainly do not want to put them at risk .
i was very happy to see that this concern was taken into consideration .
i wish to discuss the functions that extend beyond the drinking and driving issue that were brought to my attention two years ago .
customs officers currently have the power to detain and arrest individuals for Customs Act offences such as smuggling .
they also have the authority to search for and seize goods , such as illegal drugs , firearms , contraband tobacco and liquor , and prohibited materials such as child pornography .
the scope of the customs officers ' existing powers of arrest and detention will be broadened to bridge the gap between the time customers officers detect a Criminal Code offence and the time it takes for the police to arrive and intervene .
the changes will also authorize customers officers to arrest individuals who are subject to arrest warrants issued under the Criminal Code .
in the case of impaired driving , designated customs officers will administer the preliminary roadside screening test .
individuals who do not pass the screening test will be turned over to the police for a breathalyser test .
provincial authorities will be responsible for any further investigations and prosecutions of individuals for Criminal Code offences at the border .
those of us who received a package from the customs excise union last month will have undoubtedly read the letter written by Mr. Stan Johnson , a customs inspector at the Windygates , Manitoba border crossing .
it is evident from Mr. Johnson ' s letter that he is struggling with the frustration that his role as a customs officer did not allow him to stop this tragedy .
it is wrong to subject our customs officials to this frustration when these tragedies are clearly preventable .
the customs and excise union has been calling for this type of corrective measure for more than a decade .
the customs and excise union and those on the front line at the Peace Bridge in Fort Erie support this measure .
in a recent letter the union said there was a tremendous need to bridge a very obvious gap in legislation that had existed far too long .
i will comment on a couple of questions asked in the House today .
why has it taken so long to get to this position ?
the situation is not a simple one .
we have to do it right .
it was necessary to assess thoroughly the nature and severity of the situation across Canada .
it was also necessary to properly evaluate the various options and to discuss them with both federal and provincial officials .
i am confident the proposed legislation is both reasonable and workable .
the health and safety of customs officers have been and will continue to be priorities .
customs officers do not carry firearms .
the proposal to extend the scope of their arrest powers would not change that .
some customs officers believe they should carry a weapon for their personal protection .
however it is the government ' s position that introducing firearms at the border is unnecessary and could be a serious mistake .
we have to bear in mind that this is not entirely new ground for customs officers .
as I said , they are already designated as peace officers for purposes of the Customs Act .
to date they have not needed a firearm to fulfil their responsibilities safely and efficiently .
arming them could invite more violent behaviour on the part of travellers .
if not handled properly , an officer ' s firearm could provide an otherwise unarmed traveller with a weapon that could actually be used to injure or kill the officer or other people in the vicinity .
we also have to bear in mind that the role of customs officers will be very limited .
they will provide a first response only .
they will not be expected to participate in Criminal Code investigations or to transport prisoners , as the police will intervene at a very early stage .
for these reasons the government has chosen not to arm our officers .
some concern was expressed about the impact on police and the judicial case load .
it would probably be very minimal .
furthermore we expect that implementing this initiative will have a deterrent effect .
we expect the number of incidents will drop significantly when the travelling public realizes and becomes aware that the customs officers are empowered to deal with criminal offences .
as I have indicated , this is good legislation .
it should hopefully be passed unanimously by the House .
the concerns being expressed today are very minimal .
the country would be well suited to defend its borders and citizens from criminal activities , from individuals crossing its borders with criminal intent and undertaking criminal activities .
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) :
some of these border crossings have Canada customs persons present and only one person overnight .
i visualize a situation where customs officers , because of the lack of manpower , will have the opportunity under the legislation to take certain remedial action in situations .
the question in my mind is , that being the case , whether they will actually have the resources .
over the ensuing half hour period - and this is a very common occurrence - five or six or seven cars could be lined up , waiting .
we could end up giving these border guards extra resources legally .
will the government be prepared to give extra financial resources and people to actually get the job done ?
along the same lines I am also concerned about the fact that many people involved in Canada Customs at the border in all likelihood would be easily overpowered in the event of a physical altercation .
has the government given thought to changing the profile of the people it will be hiring for Canada Customs ?
if more physical action is expected by Canada Customs inspectors , will courses be available ?
will training be available for them so that they come up to speed and handle themselves ?
it is one thing for this legislature to enact law that will empower the officials , but is the government actually prepared to devote the fiscal resources to Canada Customs to ensure it will be able to carry out that law without there being the potential of danger to itself and its fellow workers ?
Mr. John Maloney :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
it is a very good one .
if we give these powers there have to be resources available to allow them to utilize them .
the hon. member lives in an area where border crossings are very light .
i live in an area where there are four border crossings , all of which are very high volume border crossings .
the situation of one person being on the border would never happen .
there are many people on all shifts .
they definitely need the resources to do the job .
i have some concerns with one person being on a border in the evening .
the hon. member asked if they would have the proper training or the proper education .
i have indicated that is a necessity .
as far as anticipation of more physical altercations at the border is concerned , I do not anticipate it will happen any more than it happens right now .
they should be properly trained for that .
notwithstanding , certainly more training is required and more training will be given .
resources will be committed .
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his excellent speech .
it is my knowledge that he has been consistent and has persevered in bringing the attention to these matters that they deserve not only in this Parliament but in the last parliament .
many members have worked and lived in constituencies across the land with border points .
the member has written to the department .
he has been involved in continuing dialogue and supporting the legislation as it came forward .
many members with border points in their constituencies have been there , which we as a department appreciate .
it is my firm belief that concern for Canadians is not a partisan issue .
i hope we will start on this exercise shortly .
we will manage this change as well as other changes we have made over the past number of years to make our border a smart border , a border that customs officers and Canadians can be proud of .
we do not want to hassle people as they cross the border .
we want proper risk management .
we want to target goods and people who present a security or a criminal risk to the country .
we want to stop smuggling .
our goal is to help the tourism industry .
our goal is to help returning Canadian residents when they travel abroad to access all the facilities they need in a professional and competent manner .
we at Revenue Canada are providing customs officers with tools to help them better do their job .
in the last parliament we brought forth initiatives on some new projects that we are working toward implementing throughout the land .
we will have a very sophisticated , modern customs administration .
as the minister said earlier , Canada can be very proud of its customs administration .
we can be very proud of the people in customs .
i know union officials in the hon. member ' s riding have talked to him .
i congratulate him in his work and all other people in the House , no matter what party , who helped us move the legislation forward .
Mr. John Maloney :
i thank the hon. member for her comments .
customs officials in my riding approached me on the issue since day one when I was first elected .
they have worked very well with me , with their national executive and with departmental officials .
we have come up with legislation that is certainly to be desired .
it is a concern we have had to date but we are there now and we are happy to have it .
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini 猫 re , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , as presented by the revenue minister , Bill C - 18 meets an urgent need to exercise greater control at Canadian customs offices .
each of the provinces , including Quebec , that share a border with the United States experience situations where individuals from that country cross our border while intoxicated , or after committing serious offences across the border .
the proposed changes will affect nearly two thirds of the total strength of 3,200 customs officers , a number we believe to be insufficient to strengthen border crossings .
while customs officers reported these incidents to local authorities , the police was only able to apprehend a few suspects .
such incidents happen at most ports of entry by land , air or sea , 80 % of which are located on our highway system .
it goes without saying that , based on these troubling statistics , there is no need for the revenue minister to justify Bill C - 18 any further .
the minister also indicated that this bill would confer broader powers on Canada Customs .
under this proposal , customs officers would help police officers by taking immediate action at the border .
the customs officers ' current powers to arrest and detain would be broadened in an effort to fill the gap between the time when they observe a Criminal Code offence and the time when the police arrives on the scene and can take over .
the proposed changes would also give customs officers the power to arrest any person against whom an arrest warrant has been issued under the Criminal Code .
designated officers could demand samples of breath from suspected impaired drivers .
people who show high levels following this screening test would be turned over to the police for a breathalyser test .
so it is the responsibility of provincial authorities to continue the investigation and to prosecute those who are alleged to have committed an offence under the Criminal Code at the border .
let us go back now to the bill .
the preamble states that a number of customs officers will be designated by the Minister of Revenue to carry out the new duties .
i think the Minister of Revenue should specify in his bill the provinces , cities and towns that will be affected by the changes proposed in Bill C - 18 .
we agree that the minister should have discretion to designate the customs officers mentioned in the bill , but we would like more information on this subject .
also , I would like to ask another important question to the Minister of Revenue concerning the mechanism for selecting customs officers .
will this procedure be carried out in co - operation with union representatives ?
the proposed changes as outlined in this bill will most certainly be creating a new class of customs officers .
will their pay be higher ?
how will these changes be reflected in the existing collective agreement ?
will the seniority clauses be respected ?
all these questions need clarification before our party can take a final position on Bill C - 18 .
what will be the limits of the powers given to customs officers in their new duties ?
i hope we are not creating a new police force that could end up with the same powers as the RCMP .
i need hardly point out that our party and the Liberal government have locked horns several times since 1993 on the sharing of jurisdiction between Quebec and Ottawa .
too often , under the pretext of national security , of national health , the federal government has used such political opportunities to try to convince us that national standards are required .
furthermore , in these difficult years , we do not often see a government invest without providing for additional revenues .
the Bloc Quebecois is in Ottawa to protect Quebec ' s interests , including the areas that come under provincial jurisdiction .
therefore , our party will make sure the federal government fully respects Quebec ' s jurisdiction in the context of Bill C - 18 .
the principles underlying Bill C - 18 are acceptable , but the way these changes in the customs officers ' duties will be implemented still raises numerous concerns .
for example , given the budget cuts imposed by the finance minister , where will the revenue minister find the money to renovate customs offices ?
where will he get the money to train customs officers ?
did the minister estimate the total cost involved in delegating these new responsibilities to customs officers ?
earlier in my speech , I said that these changes will have to be made in co - operation with the Public Service Alliance of Canada .
the revenue minister claims he decided to table this bill after conducting the following consultations .
in 1995 , an in - depth study of the powers conferred on customs officers revealed that the existing situation was unacceptable .
there is no need to go back over this , since the figures I mentioned just a few moments ago confirm it beyond a shadow of a doubt .
it was therefore proposed that the powers given these officers be increased to include offences under the Criminal Code .
groups such as CAVEAT , Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating Its Termination , the Canadian Civil Liberties Association , police forces , Revenue Canada employees , and CEUDA have offered their support .
but , here again , did the federal government consult the right people before tabling this bill ?
did it take the time to go and see the people in the provinces who will have to live with the amendments resulting from this bill ?
did the Solicitor General , who is taking part in the implementation of this bill , consult provincial authorities in this connection ?
or is the federal government once again getting ready to meddle in provincial areas of jurisdiction ?
in addition , the minister is indicating that implementation of this bill could take from six to nine months after royal assent is given .
first of all , he intends to train designated customs officers , and then to renovate certain Customs Canada facilities in order to create secure areas in which suspects can be held .
once again , a grey area remains , making it difficult for us to see where the minister is really headed with this bill .
does he intend to take a global approach , or has he already identified regions where there is a more pressing need for these customs posts ?
there are many questions , but we believe in the rationale behind Bill C - 18 and this is why we are supporting it in principle .
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in response to the many questions posed by the hon. member in his speech , many of the answers were delivered earlier today in this debate .
for the edification of the hon. member I have no problem restating some of the answers .
i hope it will assist him because this is a very good bill for tous les Canadiens et toutes les Canadiennes .
this is not a partisan bill , no matter what the questions or how they are posed .
the RCMP will continue to do all of its work between the border points across this country .
that will not change .
the work of our customs officers throughout this country , including Quebec , will also not change .
they are still dealing with all these issues under the customs and excise acts and the numerous other acts that our customs officers administer for us at our border points .
this is a first response not only after discussion with the people and the unions involved but is also being supported by these same employees inside .
they are very supportive .
this honourable member may very well find that the head of the union of customs will have sent a letter to all members asking for support for this bill , and I draw that to his attention .
this is not replacing or creating some new police force .
this is a situation where we are filling a gap , a narrow gap that existed , that will help the safety at first response , the point where we can first intercept at our border point , and security for Canadians .
there are situations where children are being abducted .
this is the place where we can detain until the appropriate and responsible police force comes to the assistance and follows out with the rest of the process .
this is the place where a drunk driver , driving up to our borders , can be intercepted .
before , we could not detain an individual for a lengthy period of time in case the appropriate local police force was not , through other responsibilities , able to assist in a timely manner .
this is a better situation .
we will have the legal authority to charge and to detain .
also , very clearly this gives us that authority to make an arrest where there is an outstanding warrant and then turn over to the appropriate authority .
these are very positive measures .
we are giving the human resources , as we have given many other tools over a time period in all of our experiences as professionals .
we have to work with upcoming technology , new technology .
unfortunately , I do not think all of us get pay raises every time a new machine comes in .
i wish that were true , but it does not necessarily happen that way .
this is , though , a tool , a legislative tool that will assist our people , the people who protect Canadians , to do their jobs better .
to give the assurance to this honourable member which he deserves , yes there has been ongoing consultation and there will continue to be ongoing consultation not only with the provincial and other policing authorities but with our unions , the people who work for us .
this is very much a welcome piece of legislation and I respect that this honourable member did , in his concluding remarks , actually indicate that the Bloc is being supportive overall .
if I can help with any of his further questions , as a parliamentary secretary I am at his disposal to give him further briefings whenever he requests that .
as the parliamentary secretary , I wrote to the representative of their caucus as well as the other caucuses , offering briefings in this matter .
i would like to give a little time before question period for the member opposite to acknowledge it .
the Deputy Speaker :
i think the member will have to wait until after Oral Question Period to reply to the comments by the hon. parliamentary secretary .
we will now proceed to Statements by Members .

ALZHEIMER ' S DISEASE
Mr. Art Hanger ( Calgary Northeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , some weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting some of the members of the Royal Canadian Legion , North Calgary Branch No. 264 , along with the Alzheimer Society of Alberta .
the occasion was their annual Coffee Break fund - raiser .
i was delighted to have been asked to attend .
the Alzheimer ' s Coffee Break is a grassroots initiative to promote awareness of Alzheimer ' s disease .
to date , there is no known cause or cure for this terrible disease that can strike adults of any age .
currently over a quarter of a million people suffer from the illness and the dementia caused by this condition .
by the year 2030 it is estimated that over three quarters of a million Canadians will have Alzheimer ' s disease .
i urge all members of this House to become involved in a coffee break program in their ridings .
members should please contact their Alzheimer ' s society or their legion to offer their support .

grey CUP
Mr. Bryon Wilfert ( Oak Ridges , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , on November 16 the 85 th Grey Cup was held in Edmonton .
Canadians were witness to real football , three down football , football with the wider field and the deeper end zones .
in the cold of a crisp late fall day a truly unique Canadian sport was played out before more than 60,000 fans and millions of television viewers .
football in Canada is truly our game with our unique Canadian rules including the extra point for missed field goals .
the Grey Cup and Canadian football help to define us as a nation .
it is part of our cultural identity .
congratulations to the Toronto Argonauts on back to back impressive Grey Cup victories .
canada needs a Grey Cup and we need to appreciate the tremendous value it has .
it has helped define us as a nation .

living ARTS CENTRE
Mr. Steve Mahoney ( Mississauga West , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it gives me pleasure to bring to the attention of the House the official opening of the Living Arts Centre in Mississauga on November 14 .
the Living Arts Centre will be the heart of downtown Mississauga .
this modern state of the art facility will provide citizens of all ages with multiple performance venues , studios and exhibition space .
we look forward to attending shows by high calibre international artists like Julio Eglizes , Penn and Teller , Raffi , Broadway productions and of course the many local artists and performing companies that will grace the Living Arts Centre stage .
construction of the state of the art facility was funded under the federally initiated national infrastructure program .
all three levels of government including the region of Peel provided $ 31 million in financing .
the Living Arts Centre has itself launched a major community fund - raising effort which has already raised almost half of the $ 30 million goal .
we look forward to being royally entertained for years to come as the world comes to our new stage .

railway TRANSPORTATION
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased today to draw attention to the sale of the section of rail between Saint - Augustin and Thurso by Canadian Pacific to Genesee Rail - One and the operation of that corridor by its subsidiary Les chemins de fer Qu 茅 bec - Gatineau .
Canadian Pacific decided in 1994 to dismantle this section of track .
bloc Quebecois MPs and stakeholders in the Outaouais and Laurentian regions were opposed to this .
the hon. member for Blainville - Deux - Montagnes and myself co - authored a brief which convinced the national transportation committee to hold public hearings on the matter .
the train between Saint - Augustin and Thurso , which serves Lachute and Montebello along the way , is back in operation .
this is a great victory for the people of Argenteuil - Papineau and an excellent example of how useful the Bloc Quebecois is in Ottawa .

francophonie SUMMIT
Ms. Claudette Bradshaw ( Moncton , Lib . ) :
this proved to be a great success for Canada , confirming its lead role within the Francophonie .
canada expressed strong opinions on the political , economic and co - operative aspects of the summit , proposing concrete actions .
the summit marked a significant step toward making the Francophonie more political , with the election of its first secretary general , Mr. Boutros Boutros - Ghali .
the Acadians of New Brunswick have long awaited the opportunity to welcome such a delegation and to show them their region .

railways
Mr. Stan Keyes ( Hamilton West , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , 57,000 knowledgeable , skilled Canadians work for the railway industry .
today their representatives from coast to coast are here in the House of Commons to remind parliamentarians of the importance of this industry for Canada .
canada ' s freight railways do not exist just to run trains but to move customer freight traffic in a timely manner .
exports such as grain , coal , fertilizers , forest products and motor vehicles are dependent on rail transportation .
rail is not only a safe means of transportation , it is also an environmentally friendly one .
with its millions of carloads of freight and more than one million containers and trailers a year , the rail industry helps reduce highway congestion .
as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport , I am proud to welcome rail industry representatives to Ottawa and to invite all members of Parliament to take the opportunity to meet with them and learn more about this essential industry .

ROBERT NORMAN THOMPSON
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today on behalf of Canadians to pay tribute to Robert Norman Thompson .
i was a student at Trinity during the mid - 1970 s and one of the first people I met was Bob Thompson .
he had a way about him that one just could not ignore .
Bob was fast , feisty and a fierce competitor when it came to political debate .
when I was elected in 1989 he became and has been one of my closest political advisers for all these years .
my husband Lew and I had a wonderful visit this summer with Bob and Evelyn at their home in Langley .
we love you , Bob , and we thank you , Evelyn .
god bless you .

LATVIAN AND POLISH INDEPENDENCE DAYS
Ms. Sarmite Bulte ( Parkdale - High Park , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , today Canadians of Latvian origin celebrate the 79 th anniversary of their independence , and on November 11 Canadians of Polish origin celebrated theirs .
as the first member of Parliament of Baltic heritage , it gives me great pride to recognize these important dates .
it is an occasion to contemplate the rich traditions of these countries that serve as an inspiration for all who cherish the values of freedom and democracy .
in the aftermath of World War I , in 1918 the Republic of Latvia gained its independence and , at the same time , Poland regained its .
however , this freedom was very shortlived .
under Soviet occupation it was lost .
however , even a half century of totalitarian rule did not stifle the love of freedom and cultural heritage .
in Poland it gave rise to solidarity .
in 1991 , after the tragic killings in Vilnius and Riga , the Canadian government was the first to recognize the independence of -

rail TRANSPORTATION
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - Orl 茅 ans , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , today representatives of the railway industry are visiting Parliament Hill in droves to talk to many senators and members on the importance of rail transportation .
i am proud to say that rail transportation is vital to a healthy economy in the major centres and the regions of Quebec and Canada .
in recent years , we have witnessed the birth of many short line railways .
the entrepreneurship of their management and the flexibility of their operation enable them to free up the roadways in the regions and to maintain safe transportation .
because their infrastructures connect with the main railway lines , the short line railways link their clientele to the vast North American market .
i join with industry members in reminding people that , for many businesses , the way to the future is by rail .
let us keep it competitive .

TUNISIA
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Brossard - La Prairie , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , on November 7 , 1997 , President Ben Ali celebrated ten years as the head of my country of origin , Tunisia .
all these measures reflect values that we as Canadians hold dear .
i congratulate President Ben Ali on leading his people along the route to an ever stronger democracy and I offer the expression of my affection to the people of Tunisia .

HIBERNIA
Mr. David Chatters ( Athabasca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to congratulate all those involved in the Hibernia project and the people of Newfoundland for yesterday ' s milestone event when oil began to flow one month ahead of schedule and under budget .
this day has been long awaited not only by the people of Newfoundland but the shareholders and taxpayers .
investors can now begin to see a return on the billions of dollars used to finance the megaproject .
shareholders now have confidence to invest in future offshore oil projects .
the people of Newfoundland will have up to 650 well paying jobs for the next several decades .
Newfoundland Premier Brian Tobin is quoted as saying that he expects Newfoundland to be a have province by the end of the decade .
we Albertans know well the pride and benefits when oil flows .
once again , congratulations to the people of Newfoundland .

IRISH FAMINE
Mr. Pat O ' Brien ( London - Fanshawe , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the summer of 1997 was named the Irish Summer by Heritage Canada in honour of the victims of the great Irish famine from 1845 to 1850 .
during these five terrible years in Ireland , one million people died of starvation and famine fever .
these Irish refugees were escaping repeated failures of the potato crops , but also brutal and indifferent economic theories which held sway at the so - called centre of civilization .
the worst year of all was 1847 , Black '47 , when 20,000 Irish died on the coffin ships or in the quarantine stations of Grosse Isle , Quebec and Partridge Island , New Brunswick .
one hundred and fifty years later this government affirmed its commitment to preserve and protect the sacred burial grounds and monuments .
the best tribute to the victims of the Irish famine is that Canada always be a nation which welcomes the refugee peoples of our world .

francophonie SUMMIT
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , being the proud Acadian that I am , I would like to congratulate the City of Moncton on being selected to host the next Francophonie summit .
this is an honour that highlights the vitality and diversity of all francophone communities in Canada .
it is therefore important to look at the challenges facing young francophones worldwide on the eve of a new millennium .
the Francophonie summit will generate significant economic benefits in the Moncton area and throughout New Brunswick .
on the heels of the successful 1995 Congr 猫 s mondial des Acadiens , the Moncton area has demonstrated its capacity to host an international event .

QUEBEC CITY MAYOR
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Quebec City mayor Jean - Paul L ' Allier is still reluctant to fly the Canadian flag in front of city hall , arguing that doing so would invite vandalism and violence .
perhaps mayor L ' Allier could show the same faith in the good conduct of his fellow citizens in this instance as he did when a monument was erected to commemorate the stupid remark General de Gaulle uttered on Canadian soil .
" don de Dieu ferai valoir " is your beautiful city ' s motto , Mr. Mayor .
instead of coming up with all sorts of tricks to better serve the king of separatist colonials , Lucien I , you should do the honourable thing and represent all those Quebec City residents who are proud to be Canadians and proud to be Quebeckers .
you should not hesitate to pay tribute to the symbol of the greatest country in the world , a country that still counts Quebec City as one of its jewels .
a decision on this matter will be made at city hall on December 1 .
i therefore urge all Canadians and Quebeckers to pressure mayor L ' Allier by calling city hall in Quebec City .

HIBERNIA
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , today the people of Newfoundland and Labrador are celebrating the birth of a new industry .
yesterday as oil flowed on board the $ 5.8 billion Hibernia platform , workers celebrated their accomplishments .
many of the 5,800 constructions workers , 90 % of whom are Newfoundlanders , are also quite proud of their contribution .
it is also time for Canadians to share in our celebration .
of the $ 5.8 billion cost , $ 2.7 billion was spent in Newfoundland , but $ 1.4 billion was also spent in other parts of Canada .
the $ 1.8 billion loan guarantee of the Government of Canada will never be called upon .
the billion dollar grant will be repaid in full .
in fact , Canada will receive much more now that the amount of recoverable oil has been significantly increased .
this new industry with a potential of $ 100 billion of business from the 5.8 billion barrels of oil and 52 billion cubic feet of natural gas will be a major contributor to Canada ' s oil supply , government revenues and business profits .
on behalf of all Newfoundlanders we are delighted to begin our contribution .

north BRAMPTON YOUTH DROP - IN CENTRE
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to congratulate and commend the efforts of the North Brampton Youth Drop - in Centre committee to create a place that the youth of my riding of Brampton Centre can call their own .
the aims of the committee are to address the issue of teen violence in Brampton , to provide a safe haven off the street , and to provide the youth with opportunities to develop a stronger sense of community and belonging .
i fully support the creation of the youth drop - in centre in the Heart Lake district of my riding and I urge all stakeholders at the provincial and municipal levels to endorse the creation of this very worthwhile project and support the youth of our communities .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
airbus
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is about time for some answers on this Airbus affair .
the former prime minister says there was a high level government plot to smear his name and then an attempt to cover up the plot .
the current prime minister denies the whole thing .
he says there were no Liberal ministers involved .
he says the whole idea came from a lowly RCMP sergeant who was just sitting around in the police station and decided to go after the former prime minister .
two prime ministers and two different stories .
which prime minister is telling the truth ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in January of this year there was an agreement signed with the lawyers of the former prime minister .
it was written in the settlement that was tabled in the House today that the parties accept that the RCMP on its own initiated the Airbus investigation .
the documents were tabled in the House .
that was a statement made by Mr. Mulroney , through his lawyers , in January 1997 .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the prime minister says that no Liberal politicians were involved .
yesterday outside the House the Deputy Prime Minister admitted that the Airbus investigation is continuing , it is still going on .
when he was asked if Brian Mulroney is still a suspect , he did not rule that out .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the RCMP said that it is still carrying on the investigation .
it is up to the RCMP to decide who it investigates ; it is not for the government to decide .
the RCMP in doing its job never mentions the names of the people who are being investigated because if there is no charge there is no need to know the names .
we have to respect the freedom of individuals who are not called to appear before the courts .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , what has this bungled Airbus investigation accomplished ?
i am no fan of Brian Mulroney but even he has the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , again I will quote from the agreement .
it states the parties have always acknowledged that the RCMP must continue investigating any allegations of illegality or wrongdoing brought to its attention .
that is what was signed between the parties in January 1997 .
under our system nobody is guilty until proven guilty .
it is in accordance with the tradition of Canada that when there is an investigation we do not name the people -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Edmonton North .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to get this straight .
the prime minister says that no one is guilty until they are proven guilty .
that is wonderful news .
Canadians will be thrilled to hear that .
the prime minister I am sure is nervous to go on the CBC town hall meeting after an answer like that .
i cannot blame him for that .
i want to ask anyone on that front bench who will stand in their place now and accept responsibility for Airbus .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
the people of Canada want a system wherein the police do their job without receiving instructions from their political leaders .
that is the system that has worked well in Canada and that I respect .
the police are responsible and are doing their job .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , sadly the police are not allowed to do their job and I think Sergeant Fiegenwald is proof of that .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
miss Deborah Grey :
they are nervous about it .
what we see here is that the Liberals are going around and can give all the standing ovations they like .
they are in damage control mode and trying to blame everybody but themselves where the blame belongs .
taxpayers want to know exactly how much they will be fleeced for this latest Liberal scandal .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in a settlement with Mr. Mulroney they asked for $ 50 million in damages but accepted no dollar damages , just costs .
that was the settlement agreed by the parties in January .
when there is an agreement with persons who have cases against the government and they decide to accept no compensation , we have to say that it did not cost the government anything .
however , we accepted to pay the fees as we do in most cases with citizens in Canada .

search AND RESCUE HELICOPTERS
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , for several weeks , everyone has been speculating about the purchase of rescue helicopters by the federal government .
there are now many rumours about the helicopter chosen , the date of the announcement and the total cost of the contract .
there is obviously a great deal of confusion regarding this important issue .
will the Prime Minister show some openness and tell the House what is happening with the purchase of helicopters by the government ?
it is not complicated : we want to know where the government is headed regarding this issue .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , within the next few weeks , the government will select one of the four proposals made by the four different groups .
as soon as they are , the House will be informed accordingly .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
does the Prime Minister not find it unacceptable that elected members of this House cannot discuss one of the most important purchases made by the government since it took office , one that will cost in excess of $ 600 million ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the helicopter issue goes back a long way .
bloc members did not dare raise the issue and have a debate on it .
it was their prerogative .
they chose to talk about something else .
too bad for them .
Mrs. Pierrette Venne ( Saint - Bruno - Saint - Hubert , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
the Canadian government is about to spend over $ 600 million to purchase helicopters without holding any real debate on this issue in Parliament .
does the Prime Minister agree that it would be essential that Parliament hold a special debate on this issue , and does he intend to call such a debate himself before a contract is awarded and to stop laying the blame at the opposition ' s door ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the member has provided the answer herself .
if this issue is so important , why did they not raise it on an opposition day ?
the helicopter issue has been around for a long time , and the government has said that helicopters were needed to patrol Canada ' s shores for rescue operations , and the opposition never raised this issue , neither in the House nor in committee .
we will make the decision that it is the responsibility of the government to make in the coming weeks .
Mrs. Pierrette Venne ( Saint - Bruno - Saint - Hubert , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , this issue has been raised often in this House and in committee .
since this is an expenditure involving over half a billion dollars , would the Prime Minister agree to allow the defence committee to verify the transparency of the process in terms of the selection criteria that will be used to choose the helicopter model ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
once the decision has been made , we , that is myself as Minister of Public Works and Government Services and other ministers , can appear before a committee with officials .
but presently , we are at the review stage .
once the analysis has been completed , cabinet will meet , a decision will be made and there will be a public announcement .
* * *
national DEFENCE
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of National Defence .
as the minister knows the confidential document prepared for his defence management committee discloses government plans to cut $ 350 million by the year 2001 .
this means axing up to 9,000 civilian defence employees .
will the minister confirm that his management committee is in fact considering job cuts of this magnitude ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are , as are other government operations and departments , going through the results of program review .
deficit reduction is required .
decisions on cuts in government spending were made two or three years ago and we are in the throes of implementing them .
i cannot confirm those figures however .
the cuts that are being made are being done in a fair and reasonable fashion .
people are being treated fairly and humanely in terms of departure incentives from the defence department .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , you would never know we are talking about the lives of tens of thousands of people .
is it the minister ' s intention to begin issuing these pink slips before Christmas , or will he be delaying the massive layoffs until Easter when his budget kicks in ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I think we are hearing a lot of scare mongering here , in particular with these figures that do not have a basis in fact .
we are doing this in a fair and reasonable fashion as in fact we have done with all cuts in terms of the public service , because that is the proper way our employees should be treated .

canada PENSION PLAN
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , we welcome the Prime Minister back to Canada , but I am sorry to inform him that in his absence the unemployment rate under his government went up once again to 9.1 % .
notwithstanding , the government will increase CPP premiums , a job killer , by 70 % .
i would like to know today whether he continues to refuse any tax relief to Canadians .
furthermore I would like to know , given this increase in premiums , whether he will make public today studies on the impact this increase in premiums will have on the jobs of Canadians .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the issue has been discussed and is currently before this House .
the agreement concerning the Canada pension plan was reached with the provincial governments .
the legislation reflects the decision of the provincial governments and of the federal government to ensure that the Canada pension plan can continue to operate in the next century .
there is an agreement with the provinces , and there will surely be an impact because of the increase , but at the same time we expect that during the coming years , there will be a reduction in contributions for -
the Speaker :
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister , once again , is trying to evade the question .
i am talking about his government ' s taxes , not those of the provincial governments .
this will cost jobs for students , two to three summer jobs .
how could the Prime Minister accept this ?
how is it that he will not offer tax relief to Canadians to offset this increase in CPP premiums ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the first responsibility of the federal government was to clean up the mess created by the Tory government .
we took a deficit of $ 42 billion and reduced it to zero .
in fact during the last four years more than 970,000 new jobs have been created .
during the last campaign the leader of the Conservative Party promised one million jobs in five years and we have done it in four years .

airbus
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government refuses to withdraw a letter containing a false accusation that was the basis for the $ 50 million lawsuit in the Airbus scandal .
it settled that mess out of court and it cost taxpayers millions of dollars .
based upon that same false piece of correspondence we now have a $ 35 million lawsuit against taxpayers .
when will the Prime Minister withdraw that letter and stop the lawsuits against taxpayers ?
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
let me remind the hon. member that in the terms of settlement entered into between the government and the former prime minister of Canada , he specifically acknowledged the fact that it is a duty and obligation of the RCMP to pursue all investigations and all allegations made in relation to the matter before us .
Mr. Jack Ramsay ( Crowfoot , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question for the Prime Minister was why he would not withdraw the letter that laid the base for the $ 50 million lawsuit and that now lays the base for the $ 35 million lawsuit .
they know it contains false information and false accusations .
why will they not withdraw that letter ?
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government has made it very plain to the Swiss authorities to whom the letter was sent that anything contained in that letter are in fact allegations .
no conclusions of guilt or innocence are raised .
they are in fact allegations .
the terms of settlement are clear .
the former prime minister acknowledges the right and responsibility of the RCMP to pursue these investigations .

canada POST
Mr. R 茅 jean Lefebvre ( Champlain , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for Canada Post .
last night , the minister responsible for the Canada Post Corporation stated that before special legislation could be introduced there had to be a strike .
in so doing , he was suggesting that he would not hesitate to use special legislation if there were a postal strike .
over and above the good intentions the minister responsible for Canada Post claims to have , is he not provoking postal workers with such thinly veiled threats ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to inform the hon. member and the House that negotiations resumed yesterday and are still under way between Canada Post and the postal workers ' union .
i can state that these are progressing well and I would like to give them a chance .
the hon. member can , therefore , be glad that negotiations are under way .
we trust that they will continue , and that a settlement will soon be negotiated .
Mr. R 茅 jean Lefebvre ( Champlain , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , is the real scenario the government wants to see not a general strike it could settle promptly through special legislation , as the minister let slip late this past summer ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the wish of the government , and of all Canadians I believe , is for a settlement to be negotiated , and we hope to have one as soon as possible .

taxation
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
since the finance minister will not commit to broad based tax relief , will the Prime Minister commit to stop raising taxes through the hidden tax grab called bracket creep ?
hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , members on this side of the House are very familiar with the fact that our income taxes are very high .
when we have the appropriate measures -
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
hon. Jim Peterson :
i am very pleased that we have taken a step by not bringing in wholesale tax cuts in the way the opposition wanted .
that would have put our fiscal deficit out of reach .
we have done the responsible thing and we will introduce a tax cut only when it can be sustained -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Calgary Southeast .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are glad to finally hear that admission .
the problem is that Canadians are suffering because of a tax burden which is getting higher every year .
when will the Minister of Finance or the Prime Minister stop this destructive tax on inflation , or will they continue to be known by Canadians as the bracket creeps ?
hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we will work in a responsible way to bring down taxes because we know that Canada of all G - 7 countries has one of the highest rates of personal income tax .
we will not sacrifice our efforts to reduce the deficit and to bring down our debt just because this party is calling for a tax cut .
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Rosemont .

the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
while environmental groups have unanimously condemned the Regina agreement and cited the position taken by Quebec as an example , the president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers , for his part , said that it was the best agreement his association could have hoped for .
will the Prime Minister admit that his position is the best proof that his government has caved in to the petroleum lobby and to its representative , the Reform Party ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to reply to this question because it is the first time we have managed to reach an agreement with the provinces .
the provinces said that the Canadian position is a position -
hon. Jean J . Charest :
without Quebec .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien :
yes , it is easy for you to say that now .
there will be an agreement .
this is a position that we are going to defend in Kyoto and that we can improve .
now we know what the provinces are prepared to do .
rather than impose our views , we tried to reach a consensus with the governments of all provinces -
an hon. member :
except Quebec .
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Rosemont .
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister had promised a very firm position on the reduction of greenhouse gases .
today , he is content to follow the American position .
is this not another of the Prime Minister ' s broken promises ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we consulted the provinces .
we have not taken a final position yet , but we are very happy to see that the provinces realize that there is a problem and that they will have to work with the federal government .
we are continuing our consultations with other governments and we hope to have an agreement in Kyoto signed by the Europeans and the Americans .
we also hope that the third world will want to be part of any agreement , because atmospheric problems concern developing , as well as developed , countries .

canada PENSION PLAN
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
that amounts to over $ 3,000 in new CPP taxes per working Canadian .
is taking more to deliver less the minister ' s idea of retirement security for Canadians ?
hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we acted after 15 years of inaction .
we were the government that was able to work with the provinces to put the Canada pension plan on a sustainable basis .
none of us like tax increases , but more than anything else we have sustained the viability of the Canada pension plan and we are proud of it .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , this new CPP tax will take out of Newfoundland $ 860 million more .
the taxpayers ' federation says that the government ' s proposed reforms are not sustainable , not affordable and patently unfair .
when will the minister simply admit how unfair this plan really is ?
hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , talking in terms of fairness , this is the party that had no plans to deal with the $ 600 billion of unfunded liabilities in this plan .
we have taken the responsible course .
it was something we did in consultation with the provinces .
our senior citizens can rest assured that they have an indexed pension -

former SINGER EMPLOYEES
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
the federal government is stalling for time in the matter involving the former employees of the Singer company .
we must remember that the Minister of Human Resources Development has always maintained his compassion for them and his diligence on their behalf .
where are the minister ' s compassion and diligence as he drags people whose average age is 82 before the courts instead of providing a settlement ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are acting totally responsibly .
i have instructed our lawyers to act diligently and quickly , and we are not in a position to settle out of the court because we cannot acknowledge a responsibility that was not ours with respect to the Singer pension fund .

privacy
Mr. Roger Gallaway ( Sarnia - Lambton , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the secretary of state responsible for financial institutions .
at the stroke of midnight on Halloween night , the Toronto - Dominion Bank passed all of its customer information to its insurance , mortgage and security subsidiaries unless each customer said no to its negative option marketing demand .
will the secretary move by legislation to stop this invasion of privacy ?
hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as the member knows , from 1990 to 1996 the Canadian Standards Association , which consists of management , labour , consumers , provincial and federal governments , worked to draw up a code of privacy for our financial institutions .
i am pleased to say that in this instance the guidelines of the Canadian Standards Association were met .
however , privacy is an issue which is of very great concern to us .
we hope the task force is going to look into it and , of course , the finance committee would welcome their views .

foreign AFFAIRS
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , in the House the Liberals are fond of standing up , beating their chests talking about how great they are with the UN , about how good they are at attacking Saddam Hussein , but they are letting a billion dollar trade deal sneak through and hopefully nobody will see it , leaving it to the UN to decide what to do .
when will this government stand up and let Saddam Hussein know exactly where it stands on that issue ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we already have .
we have made it very clear that they must live up to all their obligations under the United Nations .
i want to point out to the hon. member that the proposal to exchange goods is for humanitarian purposes , to help the children of Iraq , not Saddam Hussein .
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday we heard the Deputy Prime Minister say that they let the UN decide whether this was a good deal or not , whether trucks were all right and whether trucks could be used for humanitarian purposes or used by the military .
that is the question .
we need to send a message to Iraq on where we stand and that we are with our allies , standing up for the sanctions the UN is going to impose .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is clearly out in space on this .
the reality is that under the UN sanctions we first consider any application that comes to us and whether it meets the criteria .
it is then referred to the UN and comes back to us to see if it fits our export and import laws .
i would suggest that before the hon. member asks those kinds of questions that he first learn what goes on in Canada and not making fabrications to try and suggest that something is happening which is not happening .

canada POST
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Minister of Public Works angrily condemned the Canadian Union of Postal Workers for refusing to allow Canada Post to eliminate 4,000 jobs .
his comments indicated a clear bias in favour of the corporation and an open hostility toward the working Canadians who are fighting for their jobs .
will the minister withdraw his damaging statements of yesterday and let the parties conclude a new agreement free of interference and free of the kind of threats that we heard yesterday ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , what I said before in French I will say now in English .
the two parties have been in negotiations since yesterday .
they negotiated and according to reports I have , they are doing very well .
i hope that very soon we will have a negotiated settlement .
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the biggest single obstacle in this round of bargaining stems from the Liberal government demanding that Canada Post pay dividends of over $ 200 million over the next five years .
canada Post wants to meet those demands by eliminating jobs .
since when is Canada Post supposed to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in profits when its mandate is to put revenues into better service for Canadians ?
will the minister and his government withdraw this unreasonable demand for profits , take away the need to eliminate jobs and thereby move us toward a speedy settlement in this round of bargaining ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , what this government and this minister want is a very viable postal service for all Canadians so that Canadians can continue to receive the mail and Canadian workers can continue to have jobs and create new jobs .
that is what we are doing .
that is what is on the table .
i hope that the hon. gentleman with his connection to the union will speak to his friends so that we can have a negotiated settlement as soon as possible .

Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
yesterday was a great day for Newfoundland and , indeed , all of Canada as Hibernia oil flowed for the first time .
a new industry was born which will produce billions of dollars for the Government of Canada .
on October 18 , 1994 the Prime Minister stated in the House in response to a question on Hibernia financing " If we had to do it all over again , perhaps we should have not gone ahead '' .
will the Prime Minister now acknowledge that the Hibernia project was a great project for all the people of Canada ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , when I was minister of energy I worked very hard to make sure that we would proceed very quickly .
i was trying to get an agreement which was denied by the then Conservative government of the Province of Newfoundland .
if that had happened , production would have occurred in Canada 10 years ago .

employment INSURANCE
Mr. Norman Doyle ( St. John ' s East , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
undoubtedly the minister will be aware - and if he is not aware , he should be - that his department has delayed the issuance of employment insurance payments in Newfoundland .
these payments are due tomorrow , but because of a looming postal strike , they will not be issued until next week .
they need their money now .
will the minister give these people assurances that payments due this week will be issued this week , postal strike or not ?

post - SECONDARY EDUCATION
Ms. Carolyn Bennett ( St. Paul ' s , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
young Canadians are increasingly aware that the most important criteria for whether they have a job when they are 30 is the level of their post - secondary education .
they are also increasingly concerned that they might not be able to afford it .
i ask the minister what he is doing to ensure that all Canadians will be able to get this kind of education when they want it .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for her very timely question .
our government does recognize the financial difficulties of students and it is taking action .
yesterday and today I have been hosting the first ever national conference of all stakeholders addressing student loans .

parks CANADA
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz ( Yellowhead , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , since the Heritage Minister shut down Banff and Jasper airstrips , pilots have been ticketed .
last week a plane loaded with Parks Canada officials landed in Banff and was not ticketed .
why were they not ticketed ?
why are they flying above the law ?
hon. Andy Mitchell ( Secretary of State ( Parks ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member should know that Parks Canada has regulations that govern those airstrips .
part of those regulations are that emergency landings can be made .
this was an emergency landing .
it was under the regulations and it was an appropriate use of that airstrip .
parks Canada follows the law and this was part of following the law .

EGYPT
Mrs. Maud Debien ( Laval East , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
yesterday ' s attack in Egypt sent shock waves around the world .
the safety of tourists and foreign travellers is at risk throughout the country .
could the minister tell us what measures he has put in place to guarantee the physical safety of Canadians currently in Egypt ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , first I should indicate to the hon. member that for several months now we have been issuing travel advisories demonstrating that there could be some problems in Egypt .
we did talk about those kinds of issues .
what we will be doing now is reviewing very distinctly what kind of other measures we might take to ensure safety .
in this case the primary responsibility is to issue the advisory and to ensure that people understand what kind of problems there might be .
* * *
self - GOVERNMENT
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the lack of this government ' s leadership on aboriginal issues was shown once again as courts were left to make controversial rulings about logging rights on crown land .
as aboriginal leaders and premiers meet today to discuss constitutional issues , will this government now show leadership and state support for both ongoing formal participation of aboriginal leaders in constitutional talks and for constitutionally recognizing aboriginal peoples ' inherent right to self - government ?
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this government ' s position on self - government is very clear .
we introduced a policy recognizing the inherent right to self - government and our government is working in partnership with First Nations to ensure the development of those self - governing bodies that will allow for better and more timely application of programs and strategies for our aboriginal people .

HALIFAX AIRPORT
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
yesterday at the aviation conference , he said that he would like to have the opportunity to refute some of the negative remarks in the newspapers about the devolution process regarding the Halifax airport .
i am pleased to give him the opportunity .
i wonder if he could give assurance to the Halifax airport people that Halifax airport will get the same investment , the same facilities and the same consideration as the airports in Winnipeg and Ottawa got under their devolution process because they all have about the same volume of traffic .
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I can unequivocally guarantee the hon. member that Halifax will be treated the same way all other cities in the country have been treated in the negotiations .
i do not propose to negotiate in public .
i hope that all sides can be bound by the results of that study .
* * *
Mr. John Cannis ( Scarborough Centre , Lib . ) :
my question is for the Minister of Transport .
there has been speculation in the press lately that the government is considering restructuring VIA Rail in order to accommodate partnership with the private sector .
can the minister clarify what the government ' s intentions are regarding the privatization of VIA Rail ?
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I think all Canadians have a commitment to the continuation of the passenger rail service .
i think VIA ' s management has done an outstanding job at reducing costs over the last few years .
with the level of subsidy that VIA has at its disposal , it does not have the money to refinance for new equipment .
we have to find other ways .
what I said in a speech yesterday is that we should look at bringing in the private sector , perhaps with some kind of franchising arrangement .
i will be asking the Standing Committee on Transport to look at all these matters in the new year so that it can give us its advice and so that there is a wide spectrum of opinion for the government to make its decisions on .

airbus
Mr. John Nunziata ( York South - Weston , Ind . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
Brian Mulroney and indeed every Canadian is entitled to due process of law .
it is obvious to everyone , to the RCMP and to every Canadian that the case against Brian Mulroney is frivolous and vexatious .
Brian Mulroney is an innocent man and the Prime Minister knows it .
for that reason , his government approved a settlement in the case that Mr. Mulroney brought against the Government of Canada .
to allow the investigation to carry on , the Prime Minister is suggesting that there is -

the hon. member for Nanaimo - Alberni .

the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , last week in Regina the provinces reached an agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2010 .
however , the federal government has not said what its position will be , whether it will be going with the provinces ' position or take something else to Kyoto .
my question is what is the position of the government in Kyoto ?
secondly , what is the plan to achieve these targets ?
what is the position ?
what is the plan ?
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we still have not heard any position from the Reform Party .
the reality is that we had a federal - provincial communique last week in Regina in which the provincial ministers said that they agreed that the federal government should have flexibility with regard to our targets .
they said that they wanted emissions reduced by approximately 2010 and agreed that there should be further reductions after that .
we wish that the Reform Party would show some concern for the environment and its serious national interest .

foreign AFFAIRS
Mr. Beno 卯 t Sauvageau ( Repentigny , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
but the Minister of Foreign Affairs said he would travel to Egypt to try to resolve the matter .
could the minister , who is now back from Egypt , tell us whether he discussed Mrs. Robitaille ' s situation with his Egyptian counterpart and signed an agreement recognizing Canadian court rulings ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , indeed , I made representations directly to President Moubarak of Egypt , who promised to immediately look into the matter and take appropriate action .

health
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government has just confirmed Greenpeace findings of lead content in children ' s toys and vinyl products that is higher than Health Canada guidelines .
it then had the gall to dismiss its own findings by stating there is no significant risk to children .
why does the government not care enough about the health and safety of children to do something about this serious issue ?
would the Minister of Health himself buy for his children a product with dangerously high levels of lead and cadmium like this particular product ?
the Speaker :
colleagues , I urge you not to bring any props into this House .
the question then I will rule out of order .
that brings to a close our question period .
i have notices of questions of privilege from the hon. members for Sarnia - Lambton and York South - Weston .
and I have a point of order from the member for Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough .

privilege
drafting LEGISLATION
Mr. Roger Gallaway ( Sarnia - Lambton , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to the notice I gave yesterday I rise on this question of privilege .
yesterday morning the legislative counsel office advised me that in response to a request for a status report on a private member ' s bill being drafted for me that the work of drafting this legislation is in the hands of a classroom of students at Ottawa University .
this advice came by phone and subsequently by letter .
i am aware that the recent annual report of the House of Commons alluded to a partnership between this House and the University of Ottawa with respect to training students .
that being noted and as a consequence I would submit the following to you as a prima facie case of privilege .
first , giving this drafting assignment to a classroom of students is placing in the public domain certain ideas which I assume would be first tabled in this House at first reading of the bill .
second , as a member I have the right to assume and I have the right to expect that work carried out on my behalf will remain confidential ; that is , out of the public domain until such time that it is in fact tabled in this House or released by me .
i would hardly think that a classroom of students at a public university in any way meets the test of confidentiality of bills being drafted .
it is in fact releasing work in progress from a member ' s office into the public domain .
third , sending this matter to a university class for drafting goes outside the parameters of the authority of the Board of Internal Economy .
Mr. Speaker , as you pointed out in a ruling on October 23 of this year , section 52 ( 3 ) of the Parliament of Canada Act vests in the board the administrative rights with respect to members and staff .
clearly by farming out this work to a university class , the board has no control or authority over these drafters .
these students are clearly not staff of the House of Commons .
in fact , by falling outside the purview of section 52 ( 3 ) they are clearly and plainly in the public domain .
fourth , if work in my office is to be released into the public domain either by me or my staff or House staff , my consent is necessary .
this work was sent to the legislative counsel ' s office on the assumption that it would remain confidential .
without my consent it has been released to a classroom of students , which is by any definition not a confidential setting .
finally , in the letter I received from the House this morning I was advised that my file was being directed by Professor Keyes at the University of Ottawa .
interestingly , this person is one and the same John Mark Keyes who works as a lawyer for the Department of Justice .
this was confirmed by placing a phone call to him this morning at his office at the Department of Justice .
one of the fundamentals of privilege is that members be able to do their work free from the interference of the crown .
is it not interesting that a Department of Justice lawyer has advance notice of private members ' bills being drafted and has input into their creation ?
that , I understood , was the reason for the creation of the legislative counsel .
clearly this is a serious matter of privilege .
as the defender of the rights and privileges of members , I submit to you , Mr. Speaker , that this releasing or delegation , or whatever you want to call it , of confidential work in progress to a classroom of students is in fact releasing into the public domain , without my consent , work or matters which are confidential .
it is a prima facie case of privilege .
with your permission I would move that motion .
second , giving this file to a Department of Justice official , a crown official , is also a matter of privilege , and with your permission I would move a second motion on that .
third , I would suggest to you that there is a residuary discretion vested in your office to correct decisions of the Board of Internal Economy when that board inadvertently intrudes into matters of privilege .
in this regard I acknowledge the general principle , as enunciated by you , that the board can regulate generally the office of the legislative counsel .
however , at some point the board made a decision that passed through the threshold of reasonableness and in fact became a question of privilege , as evidenced by sending members ' drafting requests , requests that are expected to be confidential , to a class of students at a public university and to a Department of Justice lawyer .
Mr. Speaker , I request that you exercise this discretion and acknowledge that the decision made by the Board of Internal Economy to allow students to do our drafting work is evidence that there is inadequate legislative counsel support for members .
certainly the cuts by the board , I would suggest , have passed the point of determining the general operations of the legislative counsel ' s office and have triggered the threshold of privilege .
once again , with your permission , I would move a third motion on this .
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Sarnia - Lambton has made his case .
i would like to look into some of the allegations he has put forth .
i will reserve judgement on this until I get more information .
i want to satisfy myself .
when it is necessary I will come back to the House on this particular question of privilege .
on a second question of privilege , the hon. member for York South - Weston .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
Mr. John Nunziata ( York South - Weston , Ind . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank you for recognizing me today during question period to ask a question .
to deny a member the opportunity to ask questions during question period , whether the member of Parliament is a government backbencher or a member of the opposition , is a breach of that member ' s rights and privileges .
more important , the practice has developed where those members of Parliament who do not belong to a political party are denied the opportunity to ask supplementary questions .
there is no valid basis for that form of double standard , not only with respect to members of Parliament on the oppositions side who do not belong to a political party but also to government backbenchers because they too are treated differently in that they are not permitted to ask a supplementary question .
i would ask that you review this practice , which has developed over the years , with the view to treating every member of Parliament the same , treating every member of Parliament in a fair fashion .
i was elected , just as all other members were elected , by constituencies .
we were given a mandate to represent our constituents to the best of our abilities .
by allowing this practice to continue , Mr. Speaker , you are discriminating against the voters of my riding and the voters of the other members who find themselves in a situation where they do not belong to a political party .
i would ask that you review the practice .
the Speaker :
my colleague , I would of course not want to be discriminatory either in question period or in the debates .
what I have tried to do over the years but surely during the last two weeks in this Parliament is ensure that more members of Parliament can take part in question period .
i think that by and large , because it was the will of the House , the questions seem on the whole to be much shorter and the answers seem to be much shorter .
we have been able to get in more members of Parliament .
there are some parties that have chosen , instead of having a question and a supplementary , to have a question by one member and a second question by another member .
i find no problem with that .
if what the hon. member is suggesting is that there always be a supplementary , I will consider it .
if it is feasible to do such a thing in question period I will consider it in the hopes that this will make for a better question period .
it has been my view , and I share it with you openly , that the more members who can get on for questions the more questions we can get answered .
it would make in my view , but it is only my view , of course , for a better question period .
i say in compliment to the House that whereas in last term we were getting in maybe 22 to 24 questions in a question period it is not uncommon for us now to get in between 38 and 42 .
in that way I believe it has improved .
i am always open to suggestions from members of Parliament .
i will take your suggestion under advisement , if that is what it is .
it is not a point of privilege if you want me to rule on that .
Mr. John Nunziata :
Mr. Speaker , you did not give me the opportunity to finish my submissions .
i am afraid you have misinterpreted my submissions .
if it is your wish to get more members of Parliament asking questions , that is fine .
in fact today you did not even give the government an opportunity to answer the question that I was about to put .
the Speaker :
i do not want to enter into a debate with the hon. member .
i believe he has made his point and , as I said , I will take it under advisement .
i have been trying to get the questions in , in a reasonable amount of time .
i would encourage all members .
as a matter of fact most questions today came in , in quite a reasonable amount of time , but there were some discussions on before we came in .
the hon. member is an independent member and of course he would fall directly under my purview .
i am very , very much aware of that .
by way of improving the question period I will take the suggestions under advisement .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the opportunity to rise .
i just want to put on record that we in the Conservative Party support the contention of the government member who spoke previously on his point of order .
similarly I just want to speak very briefly with respect to the hon. member for York South - Weston .
my reading of his question of privilege is that in fact as an independent member he is more vulnerable perhaps to the process that we have undertaken .
i fully appreciate your position in the chair , Mr. Speaker , as having to try to equitably distribute the questions both between government and opposition members .
an extensive negotiation process went into that .
the Speaker :
i thank the hon. member for his opinion with regard to that .
was that his point of order ?
Mr. Peter MacKay :
no , Mr. Speaker .

points OF ORDER
timing OF PRESENTATION
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am sure that you as Speaker are aware that at the close of question period there seems to be a rush to the exits .
i would just put to the Chair that it is my feeling points of order and questions of privilege do affect and have a significant impact on the governing of the House which you have to oversee .
i am just wondering if there is some way to effect a more prompt interjection on your part , Mr. Speaker , in having these points of order heard before the entire body of the House .
the Speaker :
i can appreciate your request to have as many members here as possible to hear points of order .
however , in the House of Commons members are free to come and go as they will .
i would encourage hon. members , if they are interested in the points of order and the questions of privilege being raised , to indeed stay to hear them .
if it proves to be beneficial for them then so much the better .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to add slightly to your consideration of the question raised by the member for York South - Weston .
perhaps you can consider the impact on the rest of us of agreeing to the suggestions made by the member .
if he were to receive a supplementary question on the odd occasions he is here and asks a question , I do not think it would detract much from the rights and privileges of the rest of us .
i hope you will take that into account , Mr. Speaker .
the Speaker :
i appreciate the magnanimity of the member .
yes , I will take that into account .
drafting LEGISLATION
Ms. Colleen Beaumier ( Brampton West - Mississauga , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to add some comments to the question of privilege raised by the hon. member for Sarnia - Lambton .
it is very important for you to understand what this means to backbenchers and for private members ' bills .
it is absolutely impossible for me to understand how this could happen .
it is not only a matter of privilege but it denigrates Private Members ' Business .
the Speaker :
of course I appreciate the hon. member ' s remarks .
Mrs. Rose - Marie Ur ( Lambton - Kent - Middlesex , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I too would like to comment on the matter of confidentiality .
it is absolutely disturbing to think , with no disrespect to the university or to the students , that bills are being proposed and prepared for Private Members ' Business through a student body at the university .
again with no disrespect intended toward the students , my concerns are to ensure privacy and the legal framework under which our business is being conducted .
i always believed that drafting for private members ' hour was carried out by individuals under the direct control of the House .
i would first like to know if the Board of Internal Economy was aware of this and , more important , I would like to add my observation that in my opinion this is a case of privilege .
the Speaker :
i thank the hon. member for her opinion that it is a case of privilege , but I am sure she will give me the latitude to decide whether or not it is a case of privilege .
the information has been well documented by the hon. member for Sarnia - Lambton .
i will look into the matter and try to get to the bottom of it .
i have already ruled on this issue in the sense that it was not privilege but was an administrative matter .
a few more points have been brought into the debate , which is why I want to take my time and look at all aspects to see if we can come up with something else .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to add my support to the hon. member for Sarnia - Lambton .
i raised the same concern a month ago in the context of the process .
we as members are not being allowed to decide this in the House of Commons .
it is being decided by the Board of Internal Economy .
we are not being given direct input .
i raised a question of privilege on that and I have not had a reply as yet .
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to put on record for the whole House and all parties involved that the Speaker who chairs the Board of Internal Economy and presides over our meetings does not act arbitrarily .
we seek his guidance quite often but ultimately in the end we as representatives of our parties deal with subject matters such as the one before the House now .
on one hand I am pleased that hopefully by next week the other place will have given us royal assent on the Parliament of Canada Act which will bring other representatives from the New Democratic Party and the Conservative Party to the Board of Internal Economy .
the House should be reminded that this issue has had a fair amount of debate at the Board of Internal Economy .
i know the hon. member for Sarnia - Lambton and other colleagues from my side speak to me almost daily about the issue .
i encourage members from the other parties to do likewise with their House leader and representatives .
hopefully next week when the board resumes its meetings the issue will be resolved .
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron ( Verch 猫 res , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to add my voice to those of my colleagues because , earlier , the hon. member for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve wanted to address this issue , but you did not recognize him .
so , with your permission , I would like , on his behalf , to tell the House that the Bloc Quebecois very enthusiastically supports the point raised by the hon. member .
this having been said , and as pointed out by the chief government whip , the issue has already led to intense discussions within the House of Commons ' Board of Internal Economy , and while I am prevented by my oath of office as a member of that board to elaborate , I am surprised to see that the unanimity reached in the House does not exist within the Board of Internal Economy .
the Speaker :
so much for that .
i do not want you to get into any secrets here .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , since everybody else was weighing in on this weighty matter I just thought I would put on record that the NDP caucus shares the concern raised by the member for Sarnia - Lambton .
we hope in the days to come that this can be dealt with successfully in the places where it should be dealt with .
in my judgment it is not a question of it not being dealt with by Parliament just because it is being dealt with by the Board of Internal Economy .
the Board of Internal Economy consists of representatives of the various parties .
if the member has a problem he should take it to his member on the board and not suggest that somehow Parliament is not dealing with it , because that is how Parliament does deal with it .
the Speaker :
i thank you very much for your interventions .
government ORDERS
customs ACT
Mr. Odina Desrochers ( Lotbini 猫 re , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , when the hon. member opposite gave his reply and his comments on the speech I made before question period , you told me I would have a few minutes to reply to his questions and comments .
therefore , I would like to know how much time I have left to complete my remarks .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member for Lotbini 猫 re is quite correct .
he has the floor to respond to a question previously put .
we will resume debate after the hon. member has responded .
he has five minutes left in questions and comments .
Mr. Odina Desrochers :
Mr. Speaker , obviously , my colleague opposite was a bit surprised at the many questions I had about Bill C - 18 , an act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code .
you will understand that we in the Bloc Quebecois are here to genuinely defend Quebec ' s interests , and when we see the way our friends opposite have been behaving since the beginning of this 36 th Parliament , it goes without saying that we are even more on our guard , since the government , using all sorts of excuses , all sorts of national guidelines , is trying to interfere in matters that concern the Government of Quebec .
when I see , for example , what they did with Dorval airport , where an agreement had almost been concluded with the S 没 ret 茅 du Qu 茅 bec to assume responsibility for airport security and the federal government stepped in and imposed the RCMP , you will understand that , because of the powers that will be given to our customs officers with Bill C - 18 , members of the Bloc Quebecois want to make sure that provincial jurisdictions are respected .
when someone is apprehended at the border point , a process will be set in motion and things must be clear , that is to say that it will be the S 没 ret 茅 du Qu 茅 bec and the courts of provincial jurisdiction , as the provincial authorities , that will have control regarding possible charges laid by the legal system .
i also asked a few questions that were not answered .
for instance , I asked the hon. member what assurances she had given union representatives .
she replied that she had received a letter .
i did not , however , hear anything specific about whether seniority clauses will be respected and whether the collective agreement of people represented by the Public Service Alliance of Canada will also be respected .
so , with this in mind , the Bloc Quebecois would like things to be clear .
i would remind you , however , that we are very much in favour of Bill C - 18 as such , since the statistics I have given offer a very good explanation of why we would like to see customs officers ' powers enhanced .
however , we want to see all of this happen with the utmost transparency and we want to see provincial jurisdictions respected throughout the process of passing the legislation , of training the customs officers , of renovating Canada Customs posts .
i think that everyone , if treated fairly , both in Quebec City and in Ottawa , will be very pleased with the passage of Bill C - 18 , for which I reiterate my support .
Mr. Claude Drouin ( Beauce , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to split my time with the hon. member for Niagara Falls .
i am very pleased to take my turn at expressing support for Bill C - 18 , which will give Revenue Canada customs officers the additional powers they require to enforce the Criminal Code at the border .
it will be recalled that Bill C - 89 ought to have been passed last March , but the elections intervened and it was put off .
this bill will have a positive impact for all Canadians , particularly those in Beauce , where we have the Armstrong border crossing .
it will allow us to fill in a gap in enforcement which currently prevents our officers from intervening at border crossings to control criminal behaviour , such as impaired driving , child abduction , the possession of stolen goods .
it also gives officers the power to arrest and detain any individual for whom there is an outstanding arrest warrant .
we want to take advantage of our advantageous position .
the bill will transform enforcement of the Criminal Code at the border considerably .
it will in fact allow us to intercept criminals at the border and consequently to provide the communities in our country with better protection .
we can assure Canadians that we will provide customs officers with training that will equip them to perform their new duties in a fair and responsible manner while remaining within the law .
the government ' s position is that there is no need to have personnel at the border carry firearms , as this could , moreover , escalate violence instead of helping resolve conflicts .
customs officers perform their jobs effectively without firearms , and everything leads us to believe that this is the way it will always be .
what it means is that they will be able to intervene without waiting for the police when they believe someone has committed , or is in the act of committing , an offence under the Criminal Code .
they will , for instance , be in a position to take the following steps : detain impaired drivers ; take a breath sample , hand over to the police those whose alcohol level is high enough to justify their taking a breathalyser test ; detain or arrest suspected child abductors ; arrest or detain persons against whom a warrant for arrest has been issued under the Criminal Code .
customs officers will hold suspects in detention until the police can intervene .
this makes a huge difference in the enforcement of the Criminal Code at the border .
it is essential to bear in mind that customs officers will use these powers only within the framework of their duties at entry points .
they will not take part in investigations under the Criminal Code .
with the exception of testifying in court , they will not take part in investigations once the police have intervened .
at present , customs officers have the power to arrest and detain persons for offences under the Customs Act and the Excise Act .
but when they observe Criminal Code offences , the only line of action open to them is to notify local authorities .
the purpose of the bill put forward today is to confer on designated officers the power to arrest and detain persons who contravene the Criminal Code .
this means that customs officers will have the power to perform arrests for such offences as impaired driving , child abduction or , as I said , possession of stolen goods .
it is important that this bill be passed as quickly as possible so that selection and training can start .
we hope to implement this program within six to nine months after the bill is passed .
we intend to apply the program at all ports of entry , starting with those with the heaviest traffic and the largest number of Criminal Code offences .
every manned border crossing will have designated officers responsible for enforcing the Criminal Code .
we are glad that the various police forces at the municipal and provincial levels , as well as the RCMP , welcomed this change .
with this legislation , the police will be able to rely on customs officers to arrest and detain at the border any person suspected of a Criminal Code offence , which will make a big difference in the workload of the police .
we plan to continue discussions with the provinces and with our federal colleagues to finalize the implementation plan .
designated officers will be vested with the powers required to arrest or detain persons suspected of violating the Criminal Code .
these officers will work at ports of entry across Canada and will have direct contact with travellers wishing to enter Canada .
immediate response powers will only be granted to those full time customs officers who have received appropriate training .
that is why I am pleased to support Bill C - 18 today .
Mr. Gary Pillitteri ( Niagara Falls , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak in support of Bill C - 18 , legislation reintroduced in this House to give customs officers new powers under the Criminal Code .
this legislation continues the good work carried on in Bill C - 89 , a bill that died when Parliament was dissolved prior to the last federal election .
customs officers are our first line of defence in keeping drugs , contraband and illegal firearms out of the country .
i am proud to lend my support to Bill C - 18 .
i believe this legislation will make our communities safer and will be beneficial for border communities such as the one that I have the privilege of representing federally .
under this new legislation , customs officers - many of my constituents happen to work as customs officers as there are four point crossings in my constituency - would provide first response capability at the border .
bill C - 18 will make the enforcement of our criminal laws more efficient and effective and will help to render every community in Canada a safer place in which to live .
under the proposed legislation , customs officers will be given the capability of detaining or arresting at the border those individuals suspected of having committed criminal offences , for example , impaired driving or child abduction .
at present , customs officers have the power of detaining and arresting individuals who commit customs act offences such as smuggling .
customs officers also have the authority to search and seize goods such as illegal drugs , firearms , contraband tobacco and liquor and prohibited materials such as child pornography from entering Canada .
a study conducted in 1995 concluded that the existing situation was unacceptable and it proposed an extension of customs officers ' powers to include Criminal Code offences .
the recommendations made by this study received support by many important organizations and groups such as police forces , Revenue Canada employees and the customs excise unit .
history showed us that if customs officers had had in the past the powers , lives could have been saved .
six years ago , sexual predator Jonathon Yeo was prevented from entering the United States at the Niagara Falls border crossing .
he was armed .
American officials alerted Canada Customs that an armed man was heading back into Canada .
sadly , Canadian officials did not have the legal right to detain him .
as we know , he went on to murder three people before killing himself .
one of the victims was the daughter of Priscilla de Villiers , founder of CAVEAT , a group that has been pushing for expanded powers for customs officers .
in the case of Mr. Yeo , the jury believed that customs officers should have been able to do more to assist the police .
i believe that the proposed legislation is consistent with the jury ' s recommendation .
our customs officers encounter many criminal situations while on duty .
i know , as many of my colleagues here know today , that Canadian customs officers perform their duties in an exemplary way .
for example , in the last two and a half years , customs officers were faced with 8,500 different suspected impaired drivers , almost 200 incidents of suspected child abductions , cases of individuals who were subject to arrest warrants and more than 500 individuals who had in their possession suspected stolen goods , most being motor vehicles .
these kinds of crimes are not acceptable in our community as they are hurting all of us .
bill C - 18 will ensure that customs officers will receive additional training .
customs officers will be trained to ensure that they act fairly , responsibly and within the confines of the law in carrying out their duties .
customs officers in my riding have raised the issue of bullet proof vests .
the Department of Revenue will make bullet proof vests available to those designated officers who believe that their personal safety will be enhanced by choosing to wear a protective vest .
many of the youths in my riding get jobs during the summer as customs officers .
first response powers will be restricted to a fully trained , permanent customs officers , full time and part time , who have direct contact with people seeking to enter Canada at points of entry .
designated officers will respond to the Criminal Code situation identified by the students .
from the time this bill receives royal assent it could take six to nine months before it would be fully implemented .
customs officers will receive full training during that time and holding facilities will be constructed at border points across the country .
this initiative will strengthen the already excellent working relationship between Revenue Canada customs and the RCMP , which will represent a more efficient way in which to help my own community of Niagara Falls and Niagara on the Lake and indeed every community in Canada a safer place in which to live .
i am aware that some customs officers believe that they should carry a weapon for their personal protection .
however , I believe and it is my government ' s position that introducing firearms at the border is unnecessary .
in fact , it could be a serious mistake .
we have to bear in mind that this is not entirely new ground for customs officers .
they are already designated as peace officers for the purposes of the customs act and to date they have demonstrated that they have no need for firearms to fulfil their responsibilities very safely and efficiently .
arming them in fact could invite more violent behaviour on the part of criminals .
if not handled properly , an officer ' s firearm could provide a would - be criminal with a weapon that could actually be used to injure or kill the officer .
the role the government has in mind for our customs officers will be to provide a first response service .
they will not be expected to participate in a Criminal Code investigation or transport prisoners .
police will intervene at the earliest possible stage .
as I said before , a great many of my constituents work as customs officers .
i am well aware that they are carrying out a tremendous job with Child Find Canada and Operation Go Home in trying to alleviate the suffering for all those who experience the pain of missing or abducted children .
customs officers have every reason to be proud of their contribution to Canada ' s efforts to return abducted children to their homes .
they have always acted professionally and completely within the scope of their authority .
the legislative changes called for in the legislation we are debating today will enhance their ability to assist with the retrieval of missing children because it will enable them to detain suspected abductors and turn them over to the appropriate police authority .
i am in favour and I lend by support to Bill C - 18 .
to those who are saying that the government has the intention of creating another police force , I say these measures are a means of assisting police in their work , not replacing them .
under this legislation customs officers will be authorized to only make a preliminary action to hold suspects until police arrive .
i am in favour of and I am pleased to support Bill C - 18 .
while I fully endorse this initiative , I am asking the House for the speedy passage of these changes that will benefit my community and other communities across Canada .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C - 18 .
as previous speakers have mentioned before , you will find a great deal of consent in the House for this bill .
it is a bill that is long overdue to give our customs officers the powers they should have had a long time ago , powers in effect of a peace officer .
as we mentioned before , they are repeatedly confronted by situations that at times are dangerous but historically they have not had the power to enforce the law at our borders .
as a result , at times we have seen some tragic results of individuals who have been murdered .
i might say at this moment that our officers who work at the borders do an incredible job under extraordinarily difficult circumstances and we can all be very proud of the work that they attempt to do under those difficult circumstances .
however , let us just talk a little more about this bill .
as we said before , it does give the power of peace officers to our customs officers , but we have some concerns over this .
number one is the concern of the repeated use of students in roles that at times could be dangerous .
it has been noted in this House that at times up to 90 % of customs officers working in areas that are high traffic , high density and potentially dangerous are covered by students who have only two and a half weeks of training .
this is not to denigrate the students but we must believe that these students must have the adequate training and the protection for themselves to carry out the job .
as time passes , as criminals become more desperate , as our borders become more porous , the need for these officers to be trained appropriately and have adequate protection is going to become even more urgent .
i can only impress on the government that these students who were working in this position for their sake must have the appropriate training and protection that they require .
it is a failure of this bill that it does not address that .
this bill also does not address the cost factor .
we recognize the need for it but the government must also be prepared to let us know where the costs are coming from .
perhaps the way to recoup these costs without dipping into the public purse would be to use the moneys from drug traffickers and people who are trying to bring contraband across our borders .
for too long the penalties that have been placed on individuals trafficking and bringing illegal contraband into this country have been ineffective .
criminals know that if they come into this country and they are caught , the chances are the penalties they receive will be minuscule compared with the profits from criminal behaviour .
i will give one example right now and I will get to more later .
if one were to smuggle five handguns into this country in a box one could charge over $ 50,000 for those handguns .
that sends a message of absolutely zero penalty to the criminal .
let us go through some of the flaws of the system that we have had for too long .
i will go through them piece by piece .
canada has a large porous border and the problem we have with respect to weapons is not Bill C - 68 .
it is not criminals going and getting a firearms acquisition certificate and going in and getting a course , applying for a permit and then committing a crime .
those criminals who are using illegal weapons in the commission of a crime are doing so generally with weapons that are smuggled across our border .
they are smuggled across our border because there has been a failure to block off this serious problem .
Canadians are paying the price for this and we have done an appalling job of trying to prevent this among us .
the government ' s response to this is to invoke Bill C - 68 which , at least the part that has to do with registration , will do almost nothing to make our streets safer and I would argue would make our streets less safe because of the costs incurred in trying to bring the system forward .
the hon. Minister of Justice knows this right now .
rather than investing its efforts into Bill C - 68 , I would ask that the government invest in supporting our peace officers on the line and in the line of duty to do their job and to also support and enforce the existing penalties in our justice system .
second , we will talk about drugs , another very important substance that is coming across our borders in contraband .
we have again failed to do this .
it was interesting to hear , in speaking to law enforcement officers recently , that if someone is charged with a crime , unless it is murder or an extremely serious offence , they are released on bail .
because of overcrowding due to a failure in investing in judges and crown counsel , we have such a backlog in our system that individuals who are guilty of serious crimes , crimes that affect innocent civilians across this country , are being let go or are being given paltry penalties .
criminals are walking away laughing because they know that our system is so backlogged .
it is such a bureaucratic morass right now that the criminals are getting away , which does nothing to bring confidence into the justice system for the people of this country .
if one looks at the amount of crimes reported in this country , over 70 % of violent crimes are never reported .
over 80 % of rapes are never reported .
over 70 % of break and enters and assaults are never reported .
it is not because of the police officers who are doing their hardest to do their jobs .
it is because the public has little confidence that these individuals are going to be prosecuted .
bill C - 18 can go a lot further in trying to enable our customs officers to enforce the law .
this cannot be overlooked .
although we have a large border , it is not impossible to deal with this issue .
it is in fact essential for us to do that .
if an illegal immigrant comes to this country with a criminal record and is posing a threat to innocent civilians in Canada , be they immigrants or citizens , is it not our responsibility to do what we can to protect them ?
it is a lot more expensive to try to get somebody out of the country once they are here than to prevent them from coming across our borders .
i think we need to keep that in mind .
alcohol is another substance that is brought into our country across the borders and is a very serious matter .
cigarette trafficking has also been a serious problem .
there was an answer that would have decreased smoking among youth and would have also decreased the trafficking .
it was to bring forth the export tax .
the government did that but it also dropped the price .
the export tax alone on cigarettes would have cut the legs out from the trafficking of cigarettes north - south .
when Mr. Mulroney did this , I think in 1992 , within seven weeks the smuggling of cigarettes decreased by 70 % .
the Conservative government of the day backed down because the cigarette companies said they would get out of this country if the government did not pull the export tax .
what did the Conservative government do at that time ?
it stuck its tail between its legs and removed the export tax .
the smuggling continued .
it does nothing to diminish one aspect of cigarette trafficking .
we have to address all the components of trafficking which are the conduits .
bill C - 18 does go some way to do that and I congratulate the government for pursuing that course .
finally , I will talk about endangered species .
the smuggling and trafficking of endangered species in Canada is a serious problem .
Canadians may be interested to know that we are one of the top countries in the world for the smuggling of endangered species products , everything from powdered rhino horn , tiger bones , penguin bones , rare orchids , rare butterflies and birds .
all of these are brought into Canada and shipped to other parts of the world and we are culpable .
the failure to act in this area has resulted in the decimation of some very important species , species that could have benefits for all of us , but more important are the heritage of everyone in the world .
the black rhino population has been decimated by 98 % over the last 20 years and the elephant population by over 80 % , but is now starting to replenish .
the Bengal tigers of India were for a time increasing after some measures were invoked by India .
because of rampant trafficking and slaughter and the lax system for trying to apprehend people who are doing this , the tiger population is plummeting .
there are other species such as the Sumatran tiger and the spotted cat of China which are being decimated in large part because of the trafficking in these animals .
it is a shame that we as a country that prides itself in standing for justice , fairness , one which is sensitive to the environment , would not enforce the laws dealing with endangered species .
Canadians would be interested to know that there are only a handful of hard working , overworked , and underfinanced fish , game and wildlife officers who are trying to prevent the decimation of these beautiful creatures .
they cannot do it .
another problem in their job has been the failure of the justice department to invoke penalties that fit the crime .
individuals who are trafficking in gall bladders laugh at the penalties .
the penalties meted out to them are nothing compared to the profits of the trafficking in endangered species .
but there are some solutions .
perhaps the government would entertain the idea that instead of using students in front line customs positions as Bill C - 18 alludes to , which could be potentially dangerous , perhaps they could be used with fish , game and wildlife officers to search for contraband .
then we could get a better handle on apprehending individuals who are trafficking in drugs and contraband materials .
the government could also invoke the Pelly amendment such as the legislation that exists in the United States which would give a lot of teeth to try to prevent the trafficking in endangered species .
in closing , I would again like to lend our support to Bill C - 18 and commend the government in its pursuit of this important legislation which will finally give our customs officers the power they require to do their jobs safely and effectively .
i would also ask the government to for heaven ' s sake make sure that the students who are working in those positions are trained properly and protected from harm .
let us also ensure that the courts will be empowered to enforce the law in our country .
it will be for the justice minister to take a very close and brutally honest look at the justice system as it is presently and to finally delve into the serious problems we have in trying to ensure that justice is met , that the Canadian public will be protected and that criminals will be arrested and will pay the penalty for breaking the laws in our country .
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member opposite for his thoughtful presentation .
i want to address one of the areas of misunderstanding which he has about the bill .
he believes quite honestly that students will have the first response powers .
that is definitely not the case .
i have stated that a number of times in this House today .
he can be assured that the decision has been made and that his concerns are unfounded in this regard .
i believe that we have a smart border in Canada .
i do not say that just because it sounds nice .
we have designed our customs administration to protect Canadian society , and not only against contraband .
we have set up a system which facilitates legitimate travel and legitimate trade .
we use our intelligence networks to target high risk situations .
Canadians have to understand the volume we are dealing with .
it is a very large border .
we are processing approximately 109 million travellers a year at our border points .
we expedite our trade .
it has grown from the time we took power in 1993 .
at that time it was one in five jobs and now it is one in three .
we are dealing with 158,000 large importers and exporters .
there is a huge responsibility at our border crossing points to expedite and professionally deal with trade .
however , we must always be on the lookout for the other element of society which tries to get through our screens .
it is a big responsibility .
it is important to understand that the first line people are going to be assisted by this legislation .
that is really important to understand .
the numbers are phenomenal and they are growing .
in 1996 - 97 Revenue Canada processed $ 248 billion in trade , representing more than 28 million transactions , resulting from 10 million commercial entries .
this is very important for the hon. member to understand .
he raises many different areas in his speech in which he has an interest but which are not truly the subject matter of this bill .
however , I am glad to hear that the hon. member is in agreement with the subject matter of this bill .
i will let him comment on my comments , but I did want to correct the misunderstanding involving the students .
Mr. Keith Martin :
we want to ensure , as I am sure all members do , that our students are protected and that they are carrying out their duties in a manner which is safe , primarily to them as the youth of this country .
however , I would like to bring to the attention of the hon. member two things which I hope she takes back to the minister .
the first is the potential visa requirement which Canadians will have when they cross the border .
as the hon. member mentioned , trade is very important to our country .
living in Victoria , it is exceedingly important to my neck of the woods , which has over 600,000 Americans coming in every year to spend their money in Victoria and the surrounding areas .
it is a serious issue for the people of Victoria .
it is a serious issue , as she knows , for Canadians across this country .
i cannot impress upon her enough that she speak to the minister and ask that he use all of his power to convince the Americans that we require an exemption from this visa requirement .
it is ludicrous for us .
it will hurt the Americans even more so if the visa requirement is imposed .
i suggested that perhaps students could be used in part in less dangerous aspects of their job in doing searches , not only for endangered species but also for other aspects such as drugs and weapons that students could be utilized for .
that might be a cost effective way to try to damn up our border which is very porous and needs to be plugged .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Chair was aware that the member for Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca was very clever in bringing some added relevance to the debate .
on questions and comments , the hon. parliamentary secretary .
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are all aware of relevancy .
some of those issues which were raised by my hon. colleague across the floor are not particularly relevant to this bill as it stands and is going forward today .
the questions of justice are relevant at any time to our whole Canadian society .
we are constantly looking at ways of doing our work better .
i think it is always useful to hear different views and suggestions presented in a constructive manner .
although it is not relevant to this bill today , on the issue of the visa I would like to say that certainly it is very serious .
not only our minister but more importantly the Minister of Foreign Affairs is dealing with this issue with the Americans at this point in time on their piece of legislation that could affect us .
that , as the hon. member knows , is being dealt with not only on the political level but on the diplomatic level with our ambassador and on other things that have been out there .
we are aware of the seriousness of this issue .
i just did not want to leave this debate without addressing that problem because I thought it was too large an issue not to say some words on it .
i thank the hon. member and all hon. members on all sides of the House who have contributed to the debate today .
i think we have an unusual consensus in the House .
i hope now that this bill can move toward closer examination at the committee stage with a consensus in the House .
Mr. Keith Martin :
i would like to thank the hon. member again for her statement .
i want to again impress upon her the fact that we need to ensure that Canada has an exemption for this .
as she is well aware , from an economic perspective it would be economic suicide for the Americans to invoke these requirements on Canadians .
i am sure that there is a model from which we can work more co - operatively with them , although we do work very well with our American friends now on the issue .
perhaps there is more we can do to ensure that we have a greater co - operation between our respective law enforcement officers and that we do not see the tragedy that was mentioned before by a member from her side on the situation of Mr. Yeo who murdered Ms. de Villiers .
we never ever want to see a tragedy like that repeated in this country .
i am sure , Mr. Speaker , you will find co - operation on our side , from members on our team who are willing to help the government ensure that we have the toughest and most constructive bill possible for the benefit of Canadians .
( motion agreed to , bill read the second time and referred to a committee )

drinking WATER MATERIALS SAFETY ACT
the Deputy Speaker :
the Chair is informed that when this bill was last before the House the member for Hamilton Mountain had the floor .
since the member for Hamilton Mountain is not on her feet the debate goes to the other side of the House .
the Chair recognizes the member for Macleod on debate .
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I believe the member for Hamilton Mountain had completed her discourse at any rate .
that would be why she is not here .
the bill is designed to make sure that Canadian drinking water is safe .
i am strongly in support of it but there are some difficulties .
i am always concerned when I am on the save wavelength as members of the Bloc .
on this issue members of the Bloc and I are in concurrence .
water control has traditionally been a provincial matter .
the bill is purported to look at materials , piping , filtration , chlorination systems and matters that are not supposed to be under provincial control .
i have tried to look at it from an unbiased perspective and to say initially what need exists for Bill C - 14 .
i have gone to the organizations in Canada currently involved in this area .
for the benefit of all Canadians , let me list those organizations .
they are the Canadian Bottled Water Association , the Canadian Institute of Plumbing and Heating , the Safe Drinking Water Systems Coalition and the Canadian Soft Drink Association .
whenever I find opposition of that nature I ask what need exists for the bill .
i went to each one of the organizations .
i have quite a series of documents from them .
i want to highlight some of their concerns .
let me start with the Canadian Safe Drinking Water Systems Coalition .
this group says that it tried very hard to have its opinion heard by Health Canada and has been singularly ineffective in that approach .
it is bizarre to me that a group that has an interest in the issue would not be well heard .
i read that the minister says consultation was broad and thorough .
it says neither are in fact accurate .
this group has a number of concerns .
it says there is no documented scientific case for the regulations , no problems that warrant this degree of intervention .
it says that nationwide infrastructure codes and standards are already in place , safe , excellent drinking water standards .
it goes on to talk about problems with things that are not correct , warranties that are wrong , and that there are hazardous products acts and mechanisms to deal with them .
it talks about Revenue Canada customs already having the ability to look after enforcement at the border .
it goes through a host of things the bill purports to address .
the Canadian Institute of Plumbing and Heating also expressed very vigorously that its attempts to contact , meet with and influence Health Canada were rebuffed .
it is also having difficulty finding the scientific need for the legislation .
this group gets quite specific .
it supplies roughly 90 % of the domestic distribution of components such as pumps , pipes , valves , fittings and faucets , and 90 % of the home use water filtration .
it simply says the bill is unnecessarily intrusive and expensive .
i could go on but I probably should not do so because time is relatively short here .
let me say that the groups most affected are the industry individuals , the bottled water association and plumbers .
they are not small groups .
one group I mentioned comprises 600 Canadian manufacturers and installers .
when it says the bill does not seem to have a great need , is intrusive and could be very expensive , my ears perk up .
i have seen significant estimates of costs , but I cannot dig up any cost estimates from the government .
they were unavailable .
many other areas are far more desperate for funds than this area .
there are waiting lines for health care , poor technology for health care and massive loss of nurses and lab technicians , just to name a few .
she said one problem with the bill was the issue of cryptosporidium infection .
for those listening who want to do this , it is the 20 th edition , page 1910 , where it mentioned cryptosporidium .
i looked at whether the bill would help patients infected with cryptosporidium .
let us cut this monster word down to something understandable .
maybe I could call it crypto .
this organism causes diarrhoea .
it is worse in AIDS and immune compromised patients , those whose immune system is messed up .
it is not treatable so it would be a good idea to prevent it .
most Canadians would recognize that .
there are eye infections in the young in communities where there is warm wet weather and in communities where there is overcrowding .
this is not something common to Canada .
Unsanitary conditions are the main problem .
when found in treated or untreated water it is resistant to common disinfectants .
in other words it is a tough bug to kill , a tough bug to have any impact on .
the bill will be singularly ineffective in combating cryptosporidium .
the pearl of reason for going down this road in my judgment was not sufficient .
i searched more and I found some scientific information from a group that felt the bill was not sufficient to suggest where we could go in a constructive way .
reformers try not to only oppose .
we try to say that there are some problems with fresh drinking water and that maybe we should go in another direction .
here are my suggestions for the minister and for those who might be interested .
there are problems with our drinking water .
they are generally problems at source .
in other words , our well water is not so good and our commonest problem with well water is leaking sewer pipes .
that is eminently fixable but it is not eminently fixable by regulations .
it is eminently fixable by going into the ground to fix the infrastructure , to fix the sewer pipes .
the scientific study found estimates that leakages from sewer pipes were from 10 % to 35 % .
some municipalities do not have a clue how much is leaking .
the recommendation , because these sewer pipe discharges may penetrate groundwater supplies and contaminate well water , is to fix the leaking and rusted sewer pipes .
funds should be spent to start fixing the infrastructure .
there were more scientific studies to look at our drinking water in a broader context .
i found them to be quite satisfying .
we have been paying attention to our drinking water .
the Great Lakes are a fascinating source .
it is a mini capsule look at how we are doing with the environment .
it is interesting that the industrial discharge of phosphorous into the Great Lakes has dropped from 20,000 tonnes to 7,500 tonnes over the past 20 years .
the study measured PCB levels in herring gull eggs .
they have dropped over some 20 - plus years from 160 parts per million down to below 20 parts per million .
doom and gloom is always wonderful , but Canadians do enjoy a pretty good standard of drinking water .
maybe some individuals who say that environmental legislation is totally ineffective should reflect upon the success we have had .
two reasons for my rejecting the bill would be if it were intrusive into an area where there was no need and if it were potentially very expensive .
broad categories seem to come from our legislators today .
i also have concerns about the regulatory and inspection components of the bill .
they are very broad powers of inspection .
they are unspecified fees .
the governor in council , which is fairly typical , may make regulations that are necessary for anything they want to do .
my constructive suggestion is that they should be brought to the committee that passed the legislation .
quite frankly I hope the bill does not pass but I presume the majority will get it through .
the regulations should come back to the health committee .
we had a mini victory on the tobacco bill that passed in the last parliament .
it was an accident but the regulations on the tobacco bill must come back to the health committee .
i cannot say how strongly I feel it is necessary to have scrutiny by the individuals elected to look at regulations so that we do not have a framework of a bill in parliament and then intrusive regulations doing things that were never intended .
bureaucrats are not the best individuals in this area .
we need to have public scrutiny of regulations and of other things such as fees and bills .
it is amazing to look at some of these fees , $ 300,000 for breaking some of these acts .
three hundred thousand dollars may not be much to a bureaucrat who is used to dealing in billions but it is sure a lot to the company representatives I spoke with .
the following statement summarizes how I feel about this bill , why I am opposed to it and suggest strongly that Parliament reject it .
this bill further allows the federal government to pickpocket us under the guise of what it deems is best for us .
this bill is unnecessary .
this bill is intrusive .
this bill is potentially expensive .
for those reasons I will oppose it vigorously .
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , Bill C - 14 deals with the safety and effectiveness of materials that come into contact with or are used to treat water destined for human consumption .
this legislation is patterned on Bill C - 76 , which was introduced by the former health minister .
clause 3 states that its purpose is :
- to protect the health of Canadians by providing for the certification and regulation of drinking water materials ; the making of national drinking water quality guidelines -
in recent years , we learned that we must be very vigilant whenever this government introduces a bill because , as the Reform Party member pointed out , certain provisions often go well beyond the stated intentions .
upon reading Bill C - 14 , one quickly realizes that , while claiming to promote good will and public health , the government is taking direct aim at areas under provincial jurisdiction , and this is an affront the Bloc Quebecois cannot let go unchallenged .
let me elaborate .
Quebeckers feel , rightly so , that drinking water is a collective wealth , just like wheat in the prairies or oil in Alberta .
in the past several months , a large number of experts , company and government agencies officials and elected officials have expressed their views regarding the privatization of water management , the development of groundwater and the export of water .
this is not a coincidence , given the increasing importance of this natural resource because the world population is expected to reach 10 billion people during the 21 st century .
therefore , Quebec has a duty to do its best to preserve this resource for itself and also for other nations that might need it some day .
it is therefore important to give the matter some thought so as to be able to make the right choices based on our values of fairness and solidarity .
it will therefore be easily understood that the people of Quebec want to see a serious , comprehensive policy for the management of this resource .
once again , however , with Bill C - 14 , the federal government is trying to get a foot in the door and increase its control , let us be frank , to cover everything to do with water .
where is this bill coming from and why is the government suddenly getting involved in the management of drinking water ?
for though the minister firmly denies it , this is indeed what is happening .
despite vigorous protests to the contrary , the government actually wants to regulate everything to do with water - water collection , distribution , supply , and treatment systems - in order to take in , as stated in clause 2 of the bill :
( d ) any thing or class of things prescribed by the regulations to be a drinking water material ;
as a brief background , until the late 1980 s , it was common for the provinces and territories to take advantage of the program allowing them to consult the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
this program helped in determining what treatment additives or system components should be used in drinking water supply systems .
when the EPA announced in June 1988 that it was closing down its consultation program , some provinces sought assistance from Health Canada .
they suggested to Health Canada that it fill the void by regulating treatment additives and drinking water system components .
it need hardly be pointed out that this call for federal intervention did not come from Quebec .
since then , the federal government has been looking for a way to regulate several aspects of drinking water management .
the strange thing is that it did not ask itself why the Americans had abandoned national regulations .
was general neglect the option chosen ?
of course not .
in fact , many states now take it upon themselves to oversee the safety of water materials , according to their own standards .
this is an example of decentralization that this government should consider more closely .
but on the federal side , they are constantly looking for ways to fill this regulatory gap which may threaten the quality of drinking water .
but what about this gap ?
how wide is it ?
on the Quebec side , we have our own provincial regulations .
there are five departments with a key role in the management of drinking water .
the Quebec department of the environment and wildlife has considerable powers in deciding the fate of water related projects .
that department must approve any project dealing with the construction of water systems , water intakes , feeding systems for water treatment , sewage systems and facilities for treating waste water , and it has had these responsibilities since at least 1978 .
in addition , under the Environment Quality Act , that department has the authority to deliver operating licences for water delivery and sewage systems , to monitor water quality and waste water management , and to oversee the disposal of riverbeds and sea floors and their shorelines .
that department is also responsible for the construction and maintenance of storage reservoirs for water from lakes , ponds , rivers and waterways .
the Department of Municipal Affairs also has a key role in municipal decisions on the construction and management of water facilities .
under the municipal code , municipalities can amend or repeal regulations to allow any company or individual to build or manage water facilities .
furthermore , the municipal code provides that all regulations must be subject to the approval of those entitled to vote and of the government .
municipalities have tangible and critical responsibilities in the area of water management .
they must ensure that individuals and businesses can drink this water .
cities own and manage most water systems .
they are responsible for the production and distribution of drinking water , and for the collection and treatment of waste water .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
sorry to interrupt .
it is my duty , pursuant to Standing Order 38 , to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Longueuil , Pay Equity ; the hon. member for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , Tobacco Legislation ; and the hon. member for Yukon , Foreign Affairs .
Mrs. Pauline Picard :
Mr. Speaker , another department , Agriculture , Fisheries and Food , has always had considerable influence on soil and water management in rural Quebec , for example through programs for land drainage , water course excavation , grain crop development and dairy and swine production .
in the early 1990 s , this department turned to sustainable development by focusing more on resource conservation , soil degradation and erosion , and reducing underground water and ground water pollution by pesticides , fertilizers , manure and effluent .
it can be clearly seen that , even in the absence of federal standards , Quebec and several Canadian provinces are not leaving this field uncontrolled , nor are the various independent bodies studying the various facets of the issue and advising governments , departments and municipalities on management techniques and improvements to be made to the regulations in place .
finally , the Government of Canada has certain powers available to it for intervention in the environmental field , in agriculture , fisheries and the protection of navigable waters .
we are not fools , however .
since the government cannot intervene directly in water management , it is going through the Department of Health to get a foot in the door .
it does this , of course , in the name of public health .
this is the only way it can interfere once again in a field that does not belong to it .
it would have been presumptuous to intervene directly given that the provinces would have reacted and criticized this additional meddling by the federal government .
under section 109 of the Constitution Act , 1982 , formerly section 108 of the British North America Act of 1867 , ownership of lands and natural resources belongs to the provincial crown .
the power of Quebec and all other Canadian provinces to establish legislation on water and other environmental matters derives from this right of ownership .
this is why the federal government ' s intervention in the area of drinking water through Bill C - 14 comes to us from the Department of Health and not from Environment Canada .
even though health too is a matter of provincial jurisdiction , the federal government has always felt free to intervene , program after program and national standard after national standard , in this area of jurisdiction clearly attributed in the Constitution to the provinces .
last Tuesday , the Minister of Health accused us of being opposed to safe water and common health standards for all Canadians .
that is totally wrong .
we all want to be on the side of the angels .
who would not want our drinking water to be safe ?
no one , either in Canada or in Quebec , wants to eliminate basic public health criteria .
the minister , the Prime Minister and everyone in the federal government are all fully aware of this .
what is sad is this impression , this feeling of superiority or lack of trust in the provinces , this notion that , if the federal government does not look after the problem , nobody will , this idea that there are some things that are too important or too complicated for mere provinces to deal with without screwing up .
this typical federal government attitude is what lies behind many of the rules , politely referred to as " national guidelines '' , imposed on the provinces .
the impression is given that , especially in Quebec , people are just waiting for certain guidelines to be dropped to dismantle the health system , when it is very well known that Quebec has always been a leader in the public health sector .
the recent examples of home care and drug plans , which were introduced by Quebec and which the federal government is now trying to imitate , are a clear indication that the provinces have nothing to learn from the federal government when it comes to the administration of health care , any more than they do in other areas coming under their jurisdiction .
but if we are to believe the government , everything would be in a mess if there were no national guidelines .
so it is taking no chances and Bill C - 14 contains a reference to national guidelines .
clause 5 , under the National Drinking Water Directives , reads as follows :
5 . ( 1 ) In order to encourage the provision of quality drinking water throughout Canada , the Minister may , after having consulted the provinces , establish national guidelines respecting
( a ) the concentrations of organisms , organic and inorganic substances and radionuclides , naturally occurring or otherwise , in drinking water ;
( b ) the physical and chemical properties of drinking water ;
( c ) the aesthetic characteristics of drinking water ;
( d ) the methods for analysing drinking water ; and
( e ) the collection , treatment , storage and distribution of water destined to be used by humans for drinking or for washing the body .
merely reading this clause is enough to clearly see that the stated goal of simply regulating " materials that come into contact with or are used to treat water destined for human consumption " is largely exceeded .
the concentrations of organisms , the physical and chemical properties of water , its aesthetic characteristics , the methods for analyzing drinking water : all this is far from the definition of " drinking water material " found in clause 2 and which reads as follows :
( a ) any device or article manufactured , sold or represented for use in modifying the composition , characteristics or properties of water destined to be used by humans for drinking -
b ) reads :
( b ) any chemical or biological substance , or any organism , manufactured , sold or represented as a means - for modifying the composition , characteristics or properties of water destined to be used by humans for drinking or for washing the body -
i could go into more detail but , in short , the provisions deal with devices , chemical substances manufactured and sold to be added to water , replacement parts , etc. Nowhere does it say that Bill C - 14 is intended to regulate the colour , odour or any other physical or chemical property of drinking water as stipulated in clause 5 .
manufacture , sale and use of products used in connection with the transporting of water , but nothing about national guidelines respecting the colour , chemical composition and physical properties of water as stated in clause 5 of the bill .
if that is not doublespeak , I wonder what is .
about the inspectors , and I agree with my colleague from the Reform Party on this , Bill C - 14 also contains a clause on the enforcement of the bill ' s provisions .
it provides for the appointment of inspectors , once again duplicating what already exists in the field .
not only is this duplication , the powers conferred on inspectors are very broad .
at clause 17 . ( 1 ) , the bill states :
if the conditions for obtaining a warrant under section 487 of the Criminal Code exist in respect of the commission of an offence under this act but by reason of exigent circumstances it would not be feasible to obtain the warrant , an inspector who is accompanied by a peace officer may exercise the powers of search and seizure provided in that section without a warrant .
you will understand that , as the inspector would be accompanied by a peace officer , one can wonder why the inspector , and not the peace officer , should be the one authorized to exercise these powers without a warrant .
who will decide where and when to act ?
who will determine that it is appropriate or necessary to obtain a warrant ?
peace officers are trained to make this type of decision , and they do so under very strict and clear rules .
as for Bill C - 14 , it is definitely not clear in this area .
when they talk about consultations , they seem to imply that an agreement has been reached .
as with jurisdictions and national standards , the facts are not as simple as the minister would have us believe .
in fact , there has been no political agreement between the federal government and the Government of Quebec on the management of drinking water .
on this point , the Minister of Health , for whom I have tremendous respect , went quite far in this House by quoting during question period a letter from Quebec ' s deputy minister of health dated May 1996 which , according to him , confirmed Quebec ' s approval of the bill at that time .
in fact , he read only one sentence , taking it completely out of context and going against the spirit of the letter .
he quoted Quebec ' s deputy minister of health as saying : " As far as protecting public health is concerned , we therefore have no objections to this bill going forward - "
yet , in that same letter , it was clearly stated that agreement for such a project , which involves provincial jurisdiction over natural resources , had to come not from the Department of Health but from the Department of the Environment and Wildlife , which is in fact responsible for the management of drinking water .
but the Minister of Health was very careful not to read that part .
why ?
why make such a statement that support has been granted , by misquoting a letter he knew we would receive ?
in short , why trumpet that everyone , including Quebec , supported the bill when this is not the case at all ?
but one thing that is certain is that Quebec did not give its agreement on this issue .
there has never been any , nor will there be because , as has already been said , Quebec has become far more aware of the need to take control over everything concerning water , its transport , its processing , its use , in short every facet of that resource .
to summarize , drinking water falls under the jurisdiction of the Government of Quebec and we are looking after it .
in conclusion , I would like to inform you that Bill C - 14 is inappropriate and must not be passed .
there is already too much duplication , too much encroachment , too much interference in areas where , most of the time , provinces already have their own legislation .
is there any need for another piece of legislation ?
i would like to tell you that the bottom of the river is federal , but the water flowing in it is provincial .
fish are federal until they are out of the water , then they become provincial .
launches are federally registered , but constructed according to provincial standards , of course in keeping with federal safety regulations .
the shores are provincial , but the ports are federal property .
with this bill , drinking water would be a provincial jurisdiction , whereas its physical and chemical properties , as well as the materials to carry it , would become a federal jurisdiction .
there is something absurd in all of this .
recently , in a Throne Speech , the government made a commitment to no longer interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction without provincial agreement .
no one really believed this .
fortunately not , because once again the federal government is showing us what it means by good management and respect for jurisdictions as far as the environment is concerned .
they want to harmonize the laws and regulations , but the words were barely out of their mouths before they intervened with legislation on environmental protection , the oceans , endangered species , and now Bill C - 14 with all its implications .
it encroaches on three areas of provincial jurisdiction , namely health , natural resources and the environment .
it dictates national standards on the quality of drinking water .
it creates new duplication in drinking water quality control .
it is not subject to provincial approval and was never approved by Quebec .
for all these reasons , each sufficient in itself , the Bloc Quebecois cannot support this bill in any way .
Mr. Speaker , I would now like to table an amendment .
i move :
that the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word " That " and substituting the following :
" this House declines to give second reading to Bill C - 14 , An Act respecting the safety and effectiveness of materials that come into contact with or are used to treat water destined for human consumption , because it does not because it does not take into account provincial jurisdiction over natural resources and health . "
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Chair takes the amendment under advisement for the time being and will return to the House shortly with a decision .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to begin the debate on behalf of the New Democratic Party on Bill C - 14 , known as the drinking water materials safety act .
on first blush and at face value , one would perhaps immediately jump to the opportunity of giving this bill our enthusiastic support .
if one looks at and reads through the background material that the Minister of Health has provided on Bill C - 14 we read the following :
there is not a person in this House I am sure who is not interested in this government ' s assuring all Canadians that the water we drink is safe and free from any toxins , contaminants or poisonings .
there is not a person in this House I am sure who would not be interested in this government ' s guaranteeing every Canadian that the water we drink , the food we eat , the air we breathe and the drugs we must take for medical reasons are safe at all times .
it would be so much easier to address this bill and give it wholehearted support and endorsement if we knew that was the kind of framework from which this government was operating and if we knew that there was a philosophical commitment to providing measures that would guarantee that the products we intake are safe at all times .
there is no question about the need in this country for a very tough regulatory , proactive position on the part of the government on such fundamental issues that pertain to the health and well - being of every Canadian .
in that context , we have a great deal of difficulty trying to place this bill in the broader context and trying to understand its motives , its purpose and what it is attempting to accomplish .
on every other front we are seeing the opposite .
we are faced with a government that is rapidly moving out of regulatory approaches .
it is rapidly seeking ways to privatize areas once assumed to be areas for government intervention .
we are seeing a government increasingly tied to the demands of transnational corporations on a global scale .
i only have to go back as far as question period today when we raised a very important issue pertaining to lead poisoning .
lead poisoning is found in a great number of children ' s toys and vinyl products on the market today .
i remind members in this House of the kind of actions we have seen , or lack thereof , from this government on such an important issue .
let me put it in context .
we had findings previously unveiled by Greenpeace about high lead content and high cadmium content in a number of children ' s toys and products .
the government , the Minister of Health and Health Canada all agreed that this was an issue worth exploring and proceeded to do their own studies of high lead content in products that end up causing serious neurological disorders when that poisoning enters the body .
the government released its findings a short while ago and verified that there is a very high lead content in a number of those products .
in fact , it demonstrated that the lead content and the cadmium content in a good number of those products was even higher than the findings of Greenpeace .
that was acknowledged but the key point to it all and why this is so relevant to a debate on water and the safety of water materials present in our society today is that this government then said " Yes , the levels are high .
yes , they exceed Health Canada ' s standards but there is no risk to children in our society today '' .
what was the reason ?
something to do with the fact that unlike the miniblind issue , these products were not necessarily subject to high heat intensity or to sunlight and therefore were not going to release that lead poisoning .
never mind the fact that there was a level of poisoning that far exceeded Health Canada ' s standards to begin with .
my question today is where does this legislation come from ?
what is it intending to achieve ?
what regulatory framework does it fit into ?
how firm is this government in meeting its current obligations never mind pursuing any other standards or any other regulatory approaches ?
do we not have a critical situation now in Health Canada in all those areas I have mentioned : drugs , food , water and air ?
we have a government that is in the middle of very quietly moving toward a privatized deregulated approach seeking to reduce its liability .
those are the words right out of the departmental document outlining the full intentions of this government .
what is the result of that approach ?
we have lost a valuable research bureau on drugs .
we no longer have an independent body in this country for assessing the impact of certain drugs allowed into this country and their interaction with other drugs , their interaction with foods , their interaction with environmental toxins .
come on , a regulatory body of utmost importance has vanished .
costing what ?
$ 2 million to $ 3 million .
that is what this government is saving by ridding this country of one of the most important regulatory bodies that we have in the whole drug field .
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
this is a very important debate .
we are talking about the federal intrusion of provincial jurisdiction and I do not see a quorum here .
in fact , I even have trouble seeing the government sitting in this House to hear this debate .
the Deputy Speaker :
i do not see a quorum .
perhaps I should ring the bells .
call in the members .
and the bells having rung
the Deputy Speaker :
i see a quorum .
the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre may resume her speech .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis :
Mr. Speaker , the drug bureau is gone .
this is a very important part of health protection in the country under which the regulation of water standards fall .
we also know how close we came to losing the food research bureau .
under the government ' s agenda cuts were made and because of pressure from activists in the community , pressures from the House and disclosure in the media the government was forced to back off that issue for now .
however , we know the agenda is still alive and well .
where is it on the agenda ?
how can we talk about standards and about protecting the health and well - being of Canadians and ensuring safe water supplies when the government is busy behind our backs eliminating every regulatory measure and every research capacity we have to ensure the health and safety of Canadians .
that raises a very serious point with respect to this bill as well .
it was attempted in the dead of summer , without the benefit of public knowledge and input .
here we are today with a bill which according to the minister is the result of consultations held with various groups throughout the development of the legislation .
he goes on to say " These stakeholders include representatives from industry , public health , consumer groups and standards organizations '' .
why are we now starting to get correspondence and calls from stakeholders in all of those areas questioning where the bill came from , why it is on our agenda and why they were not consulted ?
the health critic for the Reform Party has touched on this issue .
let me elaborate .
the Safe Drinking Water Coalition attempted to have dialogue with the minister and indicated to him by letter on July 31 , 1997 that the coalition was prepared to work with the minister to ensure that standards pertaining to drinking water materials were adequate .
that coalition includes the Canadian Association of Pump Manufacturers , the Canadian Copper and Brass Development Association , the Canadian Institute of Plumbing and Heating , the Canadian Water Quality Association and the the Nickel Development Institute .
that is a significant number of organizations in the country that tried to dialogue with the minister , were prepared to work with him on the so - called standards that the minister says are necessary .
now they are wondering where this legislation came from .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , on a point of order .
less than five minutes ago we requested that there be some people on the government side listening to the debate , especially the ministers who have introduced this .
we feel it is very important .
i think that if they cannot even sit here for five minutes and listen to the debate , we have a problem in this House .
the Deputy Speaker :
i am afraid I do not hear a point of order in what the hon. member has said .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz :
i am calling for a quorum count .
the Deputy Speaker :
oh , the hon. member is calling for a quorum .
if he had stated that more succinctly I would have started the count .
and the count having been taken :
the Deputy Speaker :
i see a quorum .
the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I was commenting on the minister ' s claim that Bill C - 14 is brought to this Chamber as a result of a very serious and thoughtful consultation process .
all the evidence points to the contrary .
in fact , we do not have any evidence before us to show that this minister consulted and that there are groups coming forward to say " This bill is important and we want to see you support it '' .
in fact , the Water Quality Association had promised to do a serious scientific assessment of the risks associated with drinking water consumption with respect to drinking water material .
that study is in its final stages and is about to be released , probably as early as next week .
why is it that the minister was not prepared to consult fully , to wait for that kind of helpful advice and then make a decision pertaining to legislation that might be in order ?
we do not have any evidence to the contrary .
we do not have a shred of evidence from the minister or from any other group to say exactly what this bill is supposed to do , what standards are not now being met and what the problems are .
yet we know that this bill , if applied according to the way it is laid out , will place very hefty fines on those who deviate from these standards or guidelines , very significant costs to the consumers of this country , and yet we do not know the reason .
all of us , at least on this side of the House , are prepared to say that we need strong regulations .
what will it accomplish ?
how will it protect us ?
what does it mean ?
the chair of the Standing Committee on Health said to wait until the standing committee gets the bill , but we are here debating on principle .
we are here to try to make a judgment call about whether to support this bill in principle or not .
we cannot because all of the evidence suggests that there is not a basis for this legislation and that in fact these high standards that the minister talks about could be achieved in other ways .
as an example , I refer to the fact that the Water Quality Association has pointed out that it is prepared , with the minister , to look at the NSF International standards and to apply those standards here in Canada .
as I understand it , one of the intentions of this bill is actually to use those international standards , probably provided by NSF International , which is a private , not for profit U.S. standards agency , which has representation from industry , Health Canada and provincial representation here in Canada as well as representation from the United States .
we have a bill which will supposedly look at those standards and apply them here in Canada .
we have a council for water quality .
we have a coalition of people concerned about safe drinking water .
we have a whole lot of other consumer groups which are prepared to say they will look at those standards , consider those standards and work with us if that is what we think is the best model .
it begs the question why this legislation ?
what is it for ?
what is the rush ?
on the basis of what we have read to date and on the basis of the input that various community organizations are providing it is not supportable at this time .
what are the priorities of this government ?
why are we dealing with this legislation at this point when the government is busy dismantling all those agencies which ensure the health and safety of Canadians is protected ?
on the topic of water , it begs the question of what this government is actually doing to ensure safe drinking water in all our communities .
just this morning at the Standing Committee on Health we dealt with issues pertaining to health care for our first nations and Inuit peoples .
it was acknowledged that there are many problems which cause ill health , one of them being poor quality of water .
where is that on the priority list ?
why are we not dealing with that in this House ?
why are we dealing with legislation when we do not know what the risks are ?
why do we need to change the standards ?
what is wrong with working with the groups concerned about safe drinking water ?
on the basis of the kind of inadequate consultation process that we believe to be the case , on the basis of the evidence that suggests there may be no risks at present , on the basis of the fact that this government has been so hasty once more in pushing through this legislation without proper dialogue and consultation , we will at this point in time oppose this legislation .
we urge the government to go back to the drawing board and come back with a meaningful plan based on proper consultation .
hon. Hedy Fry ( Secretary of State ( Multiculturalism ) ( Status of Women ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the hon. member speak against this proposed legislation .
i believe the hon. member ' s heart is in the right place .
she brought up some very thoughtful questions .
she made some very thoughtful interventions .
i want to comment on a couple of the questions that the honourable member asked .
the first question was why the haste in bringing in this bill .
this bill was first tabled in December 1996 .
this is not haste .
this is just bringing something back that because of various reasons , breaks , et cetera , has not had due course in the House .
having first reading of the bill in December 1996 and talking about it almost a year later is considered to be haste .
second , the honourable member spoke about lots of other very important health issues that she felt that the government should be dealing with at this point in time .
are we suggesting an either / or set of initiatives so that if we do safe drinking water we will not be paying attention to other issues ?
it is obvious that you cannot do all things at once , but this is important .
the question is why now .
why do we need this bill now ?
why do not we wait until we have a lot of evidence , until there are innumerable small children who have died from gastroenteritis because of drinking unsafe water , until we have had lots of people become ill , and then when we have all that data , let ' s do something about it ?
the whole concept of good public health policy is to be proactive .
it is to protect people , to prevent .
it is called preventive health care at its very best .
this is what I see this bill about .
i think that the question again is why not work with stakeholders .
that is what the legislation is about .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis :
Mr. Speaker , I want to answer by asking a question in return to the member , because this goes to the heart of the matter .
is it proactive in terms of the health and well - being of Canadians to eliminate the drug research bureau as part of the health protection branch ?
is it proactive to eliminate a body which costs roughly $ 2 million to $ 3 million and lose any independent capacity in this country for ensuring that the drugs people take are safe ?
is it proactive to try to dismantle the food research bureau in the health protection branch ?
is it proactive to study the lead content of children ' s toys , identify an acceptable content and then say there is no risk for children ?
is it proactive to pursue an approach of privatization , deregulation and reducing the department and the government ' s liability when it comes to people ' s health and well - being ?
those are the key issues .
how do we put this bill in that context if we have a government not committed to being proactive , to a regulatory approach in terms of the food we eat , the drugs we have to take for medical reasons , the air we breathe , the water we drink ?
how can we start understanding the need for this legislation at this time when we have organizations saying the standards the minister is talking about they are prepared to co - operate on , they are prepared to implement , they are prepared to enforce without the costs that will result from this bill if it goes forward ?
the proactive approach is to demand a strong health protection branch , a strong role by Health Canada and to ensure that this government backs off its right wing agenda of privatization , deregulation and offloading .
that is what I would like to hear from this government .
Mr. Jim Karygiannis ( Scarborough - Agincourt , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I heard with great interest my colleague from across the way talking about privatization , deregulation , and so forth .
i am wondering if the member is sitting in the provincial legislature in Queen ' s Park in Ontario or if she is sitting right here .
talking about privatization , I do not think this is happening here .
but with great interest I heard that the member said that we do not have any dialogue with organizations , we have inadequate consultations , no proper dialogue .
we have been at this almost a year .
how much more do we have to wait , according to the member ' s sense of evaluation , until we have to see the light and get a proper bill on the table , which in my estimation this is , to get Canada moving ?
how much longer do you want to wait ?
the Deputy Speaker :
i know the hon. member will want to address the Chair in his remarks .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis :
if that is not privatization what is ?
on his second point , there are a number of organizations that felt they were in the process of dialogue with the Minister of Health and were prepared to work on the improvement of standards .
they feel Bill C - 14 came out of the blue in the middle of that consultation and dialogue .
if they were prepared to do that and were prepared to come forward with an important study about the scientific assessment of risks associated with drinking water and drinking water materials then why could we have not waited to see the results of the study ?
why could we not have found ways to achieve these objectives other than a very costly mechanism which by the minister ' s own admission could cost consumers and taxpayers in the order of $ 2 million ?
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , could the member comment on the circular I received from the health department which stated that consultations were held with various groups throughout the development of this legislation .
these stakeholders include representatives from industry , public health , consumer groups and so on .
yet I presented to the House information that consumer groups and industry had tried very hard to be in touch with the department on this issue and had been denied .
i have quite a correspondence from them .
does the minister agree with the fact that this consultation has been cursory and quite restrictive ?
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis :
Mr. Speaker , the member is quite right in pointing to the number of organizations in terms of the industry , the health activist community and the interest groups that there was inadequate consultation if any .
Mr. Jim Karygiannis :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
when the question is put to the New Democratic Party , what minister is the member actually -
the Deputy Speaker :
i think the hon. member for Macleod was referring to the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre .
he meant to say member and he said minister .
i believe that was the mistake that was made .
perhaps the hon. member for Macleod wishes to clarify the point .
Mr. Grant Hill :
Mr. Speaker , if I made a mistake and called the member minister - maybe in another life .
i did mean member .
i was speaking of the Minister of Health having received this information .
the Deputy Speaker :
i trust that clears the matter up .
therefore , the next time the bill is considered by the House , the debate will be on the amendment .
it being 5.30 p.m. , the House will now proceed to the taking of several deferred recorded divisions .

private MEMBERS ' BUSINESS
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to rise in the House to speak on second reading of my private member ' s Bill C - 204 which was introduced in the House on September 25 , 1997 .
in summary , this enactment requires recipients of grants of public funds for cultural projects to acknowledge that a grant has been made and to specify the amount of the grant at the time the program is announced or advertised or open to the public .
non - compliance may result in the recipient having to repay the grant .
this is a well drafted bill which would require little amendment to the present legislation .
it simply calls for the acknowledgement at the opening of an event and then the literature associated with that event of the contribution by the federal government .
we are not talking about direct parliamentary appropriations like the CBC .
however , it would apply to grants provided through agencies such as , for example , Telefilm , the National Film Board , the Canada Council , the Canada Information Office and the like .
it is intended that specific dollar amounts be advertised .
for example , Telefilm ' s contribution of dollars for the film Sweet Hereafter or of the dollars for Telefilm and Canada Council contribution to the film Kissed .
people reading Hansard or watching this on television should be aware , for example , that the film Sweet Hereafter basically had a subtitle or a subtext which really was the entire plot of the film which was around the incestuous relationship between a father and his daughter .
Canadian taxpayers have paid money into this film .
there are those of you who say art must be subsidized in order to survive .
the Government of Canada has recently increased the budget of the Canada Council by $ 25 million a year .
the government spends millions of dollars more on cultural projects through various programs operated through the bureaucracy .
taxpayers are subsidizing these projects and they have the right to know where their dollars are spent .
many projects are funded through a number of government programs .
this legislation is by no means focused on one region of the country .
it is clearly a national concern because these funds are provided across Canada for all kinds of events , monuments , films and festivals .
statistics Canada recently released the amount of dollars spent on culture over the last three years .
federal spending on other cultural industries , which include film and video production , book and periodical publishing and the sound recording industry , amounted to $ 383 million .
i say these figures very slowly because it is hard to imagine the wanton abandon with which the heritage minister seems to throw Canadians ' dollars around on these issues .
federal spending on heritage activities including museums , historic sites and nature parks totalled $ 624 million .
spending on performing arts was up more than 3 % to $ 109 million in 1995 - 96 .
we are talking about very substantial money here .
i am confident that few Canadians are aware of the sponsorship provided by their federal tax dollars for events even within their own communities .
clearly this bill would not discriminate in any way against any particular area of the country .
as we all know , these dollars are spent on grants for events from coast to coast to coast .
again , this is reinforced by the statistics mentioned previously .
i am confident that today ' s debate on this legislation should generate meaningful , lively non - partisan debate because it covers a number of points .
for example , acknowledgement of the contributions that Canadians are making through their tax dollars is the same as acknowledging a commercial sponsor .
we have to ask do Canadians take ownership of these cultural projects that the Canada Council , Telefilm Canada , the National Film Board , the CBC and other granting agencies give to these projects ?
are they proud of these programs or events that are put on ?
indeed , do Canadians show any commitment to the fact that their dollars are going out for these projects ?
many individuals and groups have complained about the amount of dollars spent on culture .
some say too little , some say too much .
perhaps some of these complaints are attributable to the fact that it is not clearly indicated when the federal government has or for that matter has not funded an event .
the question is could we during this period of time continue to sponsor many of these events ?
much to my chagrin and that of many people who have contacted my office , indeed we have continued to sponsor these at the expense of very vital issues in Canada .
now that we are reaching the point of having a balanced budget and are starting to focus on the very high taxes it has taken in order for us to get to this balanced budget point , can we continue to afford to spend these dollars on some of these cultural projects ?
i cite by way of example an unrelated issue except in terms of comparison .
for example , the Just for Laughs festival is a highly successful annual event in Montreal funded by the Canadian taxpayer .
why not advertise that fact ?
as mentioned , many short feature films funded by Telefilm would not have been made without taxpayer dollars .
as a matter of fact , of the total number of films funded by Telefilm , over half the total number of films have been sponsored in the French language specifically with Quebec content .
so why not advertise not only the government funding but the amount that the taxpayer has provided ?
give credit where credit is due , to the taxpayer .
furthermore , this could well raise the awareness in the province of Quebec to the dollar contribution provided by all Canadian taxpayers to Quebec ' s language and culture .
this bill is also about accountability .
because of the extended visibility of the grant as a result of this advertising it will make the adjudicators , whether it be the Canada Council or Telefilm or any of the others , more conscious of the reaction of Canadians to the choices they are making .
if the choices are good , they will receive positive applause and if not , Canadians will come down on them .
i was sent to this Chamber to be accountable to the people in my constituency , indeed to all the people in Canada , for the intelligent use and the intelligent spending of taxpayer dollars .
when I took this issue to the artists at the finance standing committee in its prebudget hearing , I said that if I did not want to be a critic , how could we possibly have accountability for this ?
the artists ' answer was that fundamentally they would be the judge , that they would judge whether this was money well spent or not , that they would judge whether this has artistic credibility or not .
i then took it to the minister because that answer was obviously unacceptable .
i would like to read in part some of the dialogue , some of the testimony that occurred between the minister and me .
i read from the proceedings of the committee .
i said : " We have on a weekly basis , without any solicitation whatsoever , at least a dozen letters from people who express a tremendous concern about some of the projects that are sponsored by the Canada Council .
in a letter by Andrew McDermott , one of your senior policy advisers to my colleague , when he drew to your attention the particular publication that was called Neurotic Erotica the letter said - '' .
the minister ended up making very light of this letter .
obviously this is a rather unusual title .
in fact , the content in my humble judgment of this particular book is clearly obscene .
i went on to say , however : " I am not the censor .
i do not want to become the censor as a politician or to be a censor for Canada , but I do ask the question how in the world can Canadians who are writing to me and who are writing to many of our colleagues to express extreme distaste toward some of this material , how can they hold you , the minister , accountable for the expenditure of these dollars on the production of some of this vile material ? "
the minister answered : " I think you have to separate the two issues .
first of all , you say you do not want to be a censor .
surely you do not want me to read every book that is funded by the Canada Council '' .
i could not believe my ears when I heard her actually say this .
the point of this is that we have today a minister who correctly boasts that the government is taking action against abominable activities such as female genital mutilation .
yet by the same token and under the Canada Council grants it is sponsoring programs about tearing off women ' s nipples .
this is absolutely unspeakable and uncalled for .
it gets worse , but for the benefit of the members of this House and people reading this transcript or watching on television , I will simply say the problem is that some of the material is so vile , some of the material is so bad that there is no way that I would demean myself to repeat what it is all about .
yet the Canadian taxpayer is paying for it .
what this bill would do is hold the people who make these decisions accountable to the will and the position of the Canadian public at large .
that is what this bill is about because at the end of the day , the Canadian taxpayer must know that this House is going to be holding the people in this House accountable for the expenditures of those dollars .
with that in mind and because of the importance of this , Mr. Speaker , I wonder if you would see if there is unanimous consent to make this bill votable .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is there unanimous consent ?
an hon. member :
No.
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
there is not unanimous consent .
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise and join my colleague from Kootenay - Columbia in debating his private member ' s bill , C - 204 , an act to require that in the advertising and at the opening of a cultural project supported by public money a public acknowledgement of the grant be made .
as my colleague from Kootenay - Columbia mentioned , this act requires recipients of grants of public funds for cultural projects to acknowledge that a grant has been made and to specify the amount of the grant at the time the program is announced or advertised and opened to the public .
non - compliance of this requirement may result in the recipient having to repay the grant .
i strongly support this bill .
in fact , I have introduced a similar bill , namely Bill C - 222 , which requires the recipients of grants to specify what percentage of the project was funded with taxpayer dollars .
in this day and age , taxpayers are far more observant of how their tax dollars are spent .
as parliamentarians , we must act responsibly to ensure that the tax dollars are effectively being spent .
i believe that this bill is a step in ensuring that tax dollars on cultural projects are being spent wisely .
in some instances , some people are appalled at the fact that their tax dollars are being spent on what some consider to be objectionable material .
i have been asked who is accountable for this spending and I cannot provide them with an answer as no one is willing to take responsibility .
typically , everyone washes their hands of taking responsibility .
as tax dollars are being spent on these projects someone must be held accountable .
the responsibility falls on the government to ensure that the money is spent wisely and for all parliamentarians to ensure that the government is acting responsibly .
bill C - 204 is a step in the right direction .
it targets any grants that are provided through agencies such as the Canada Council and the Canada Information Office .
as my colleague mentioned , this does not apply to direct parliamentary appropriation such as those for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , the CBC .
the Minister of Canadian Heritage has stated that she is not responsible for agencies such as the Canada Council and leaves the decision as to who is given what for grants up to the council .
i am presuming that this holds true for other arm ' s length agencies within the department as well .
this does give these agencies some autonomy so that they are not merely puppets of the governments of the day .
however , on the flip side , it does not provide the taxpayer with any accountability for their contribution .
this leads to the question :
who is responsible ?
with the principle of responsible government that is one of the foundations of our parliamentary system , the answer should be the minister in charge .
however , as I mentioned just a moment ago , she does not claim responsibility on how agencies related to the Department of Canadian Heritage spend our money .
this must change .
our government must take responsibility for how each and every dollar is spent .
for far too long we have let governments spend money without being accountable for how it is spent .
the taxpayer is demanding that an answer to the question on how we spend their hard earned money is given .
i do not think the purpose of this bill is objectionable .
it is not meant to discriminate against any one agency or group that receives or gives grants for cultural events and projects .
as my colleague for Kootenay - Columbia mentioned , Bill C - 204 is not focused on any one region of the country and is not meant to be discriminatory against any of these regions .
events and projects are being funded by taxpayers dollars in every community across the country .
what I will say that is that under this private members bill , the taxpayers will have some say , albeit indirectly , over how the tax dollars are being spent and a right to know when and where it is spent .
governments not held accountable succumb to pressure and go on wasteful spending sprees , resulting in higher taxes .
while the government claims credit for balancing the budget , Canadians on the street know that the budget has been balanced on their backs .
they are fearful that governments not made accountable can easily run a deficit .
perhaps this government will see the light and introduce a similar bill .
by making the public aware of various cultural projects which receive grants , either in whole or in part , the arm ' s length agencies , such as Canada Council , will be somewhat more responsible and accountable for their choices as to who receives what .
otherwise public pressure resulting from some unwise choices may lead , in extreme cases mind you , to funding for their agencies being decreased by the federal government in the future .
one of the many facets of private members ' business is to fill the gaps that the government leaves open .
bill C - 204 fills one of those gaps .
i would encourage all my colleagues from all sides of the House to support this initiative .
it is a small step in making us more accountable .
i would like to go on record to show that the governing party in the House has denied unanimous approval to make this bill votable .
it is denying accountability to the Canadian taxpayer for expenditures on cultural grants .
in closing , I would like to take a moment to express my personal gratitude to those individuals and groups who promote and preserve Canadian heritage through various projects and performances .
this bill is not intended as a barrier to these groups who are receiving funding , but instead it is intended to provide some accountability with the expenditure of taxpayers funds .
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am speaking today on Bill C - 204 , introduced by my hon. colleague , the Reform member for Kootenay - Columbia , the short title of which is the cultural grants acknowledgement act .
its object as stated in the summary is , and I quote :
- [ to require ] recipients of grants of public funds for cultural projects to acknowledge that a grant has been made and to specify the amount of the grant at the time the program is announced or advertised and opened to the public -
more precisely , this is a bill which is aimed at making cultural organizations and artists publicize the funding they receive from the federal government .
i find this a reasonable idea .
people who receive a grant ought to mention it ; that would be a normal thing to do .
where I disagree is that we should have to pass legislation requiring this .
as representatives of the people , as lawmakers , it is our role to solve problems affecting society and to see that public affairs are properly administered .
we do not have to pass legislation on everything , endlessly multiplying the number of acts and regulations .
before considering the bill , we must ask ourselves whether there is a problem in terms of publicizing the fact that a grant has been given , something which is far from obvious .
one has to wonder whether the Department of Canadian Heritage , targeted by this bill , has serious difficulty in having its participation in artistic projects acknowledged .
this sort of problem has never been raised on the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage .
we have not seen studies complaining of the Department of Canadian Heritage ' s lack of visibility .
would that cause a problem in the riding of the member for Kootenay - Columbia or in English Canada ?
if not , is the focus of this bill solely Quebec ?
i would like to point out to my colleagues that this issue of acknowledging public funding is not a problem for artists .
with the cuts to the cultural sector in recent years , the problem is often the lack of public funding .
in Quebec , even artists who are known sovereignists are not shy or ashamed to reveal the federal government ' s participation .
for example , the credits of the film Octobre by federally blacklisted filmmaker Pierre Falardeau acknowledge the financial participation of Telefilm Canada in the film ' s production .
it appears in big capital letters .
the next line , also in big capital letters , reveals that the film is a coproduction with the National Film Board of Canada .
that does not cause any problem .
another example is Micheline Lachance ' s book entitled Le roman de Julie Papineau .
this book gives a fictional account of the days of the Patriotes as seen through the eyes of Louis - Joseph Papineau ' s wife .
it is mentioned at the beginning of the book that Les 茅 ditions Qu 茅 bec - Am 茅 rique are funded by the Canada Council ' s block grant program .
once again , this poses no problem .
the Reform members , and certain zealous federalists in the House , must be made to understand that , although these organizations contribute to Quebec ' s artistic production , the citizens of Quebec pay taxes , and Quebec and its culture are for now still part of Canada .
it would be natural for grants to be distributed equitably among artists , whatever their political persuasion , and works that are funded should reflect reality .
the reality is that there is a people in Quebec and that a growing proportion of Quebec ' s citizens want this people to have a country .
in Quebec , there is no legislation like that being proposed today .
most organizations have guidelines and this is negotiated freely in collaboration with grant recipients .
for example , Quebec ' s Conseil des arts et des lettres merely requires that recipients of grants display the Conseil ' s logo .
the Reform Party often complains of excessive government interference and too many regulations .
now it proposes a bill that seems to have no purpose .
the only purpose of this bill is to increase the federal government ' s visibility so as to strengthen its central authority or national unity .
a closer look at the bill reveals that it gives the Minister of Canadian Heritage extensive powers of political control over the awarding and announcing of grants .
under the bill , recipients of grants would be required to submit a certificate of good conduct to the minister .
the minister would have the power to decide the time and manner in which acknowledgement of grants must be made .
if recipients refuse to comply with the minister ' s political will , the minister may retaliate by requiring the return of all or any of the grants received .
after years of progress in cleaning up politics in Quebec and in Canada , a return to an era of political patronage is out of the question , an era when artists would be subject to the whims of political power and hostages of interparty feuds .
giving such direct powers of retaliation and control over grants to the heritage minister is opening the door far too wide to arbitrary decisions .
the system for awarding cultural grants by federal bodies is intended to be a merit system , one which recognizes people ' s creative talents and not their political views or the values they espouse .
in English , this concept goes by the term arm ' s length , which would translate as something like out of the reach of the government .
the reason artists are often judged by their peers or by juries of experts known more for their artistic sense and for what they know , rather than whom they know , is to ensure that the risk of political interference is minimal .
it is up to parliament to set the overall objectives of cultural policy .
the government implements those objectives by funding cultural organizations .
it ought not to go any further than this .
the government must not interfere in the choice of artists or creators whom these organizations decide to fund .
one may disagree with certain choices of works or artists which are funded , I admit .
our criticisms , however , ought to focus on whether or not the cultural organizations are fulfilling their mission , and not on the personality or opinions of those receiving funding .
this approach is of no interest to either Canada or Quebec .
as members of Parliament , we should work to create laws that encourage creativity rather than control it or use it for political propaganda .
last year , the Minister of Foreign Affairs tried to get artists who were working abroad to promote national unity .
when they refused , he realized his mistake and cancelled his directive .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I remind the House that we are discussing Bill C - 204 .
its title is very precise .
it is the Cultural Grants Acknowledgement Act .
the bill , as we will have gathered from its supporters , deals with grants , contributions or loans for cultural projects funded from within the portfolio of the Minister of Canadian Heritage .
it has a very narrow focus .
it deals with funding , but in particular it proposes that the acknowledgement of such support become a legal mandatory requirement .
recipients would have to acknowledge support and specify the amount of the grant at the time the funded project is announced or advertised or opened to the public .
this obligation would apply to individuals as well as to corporations and organizations .
the bill provides the Minister of Canadian Heritage with powers to regulate the time and manner in which an acknowledgement must be made .
such regulations would define the compliance certificate , which is the term used in the bill , the recipient would have to produce .
non - compliance would result in a recipient having to repay the financing granted by the minister or the agency .
i believe the bill in one sense is based on a sound principle .
governments are accountable to the public for financial support that they provide for projects and organizations of all kinds .
accountability starts with the faithful reporting of what is done with taxpayers ' money .
i also believe it is very legitimate for governments to expect an acknowledgement when a grant contributes to the realization of a project .
government money is taxpayers ' money .
it is only fair that corporate or individual citizens acknowledge receipt of such support .
private donors and sponsors routinely obtain such acknowledgement .
there is no reason why governments should not .
this principle should be extended to the provision of financial assistance by all government departments and agencies to any project .
however the bill singles out one type of support referred to as cultural grants .
these grants are singled out from within a particular ministry , the Canadian Heritage portfolio .
if such a principle is a matter to be based on law then surely we must also consider public support granted to cultural projects by other government departments , but is this a matter requiring legislation specifically applicable only to cultural projects ?
why should we restrict legislation to cultural projects alone ?
is there something in culture to be feared to such a degree that by no other means can we ensure that an individual or an organization will acknowledge support ?
with reference to cultural projects funded within the heritage portfolio , it is normal practice for recipients to acknowledge support .
it is well understood and documented how this should be accomplished .
in addition to these formal requirements I would have thought that most grant recipients would acknowledge support as a common courtesy .
the policy regarding acknowledgement in the Department of Canadian Heritage is open and transparent .
it is integrated throughout the process and accommodated with the express will and consent of the recipient as a condition of receiving the grant .
support can be acknowledged in advertising and at openings , in catalogues for exhibitions , and in other print or video resource material produced as a result of the grants .
we heard some examples of that from the Bloc member this evening .
recognition of public support is also acknowledged by means of annual reports including audited financial statements .
in the case of incorporated organizations most proposals , if not all , include a plan for marketing and / or distribution which recognizes public support .
amounts of grants are a matter of public record as soon as they are awarded often by means of a press release .
as a matter of principle , legislation should be used when other means are insufficient or inadequate .
by and large current measures can be characterized as self - regulatory .
they work reasonably well .
should there be room for improvement - and there always is - I believe that in this case anyway improvement can be accomplished without the intervention of legislation .
at the present time acknowledgement is not obtained through a coercive process .
acknowledgement policy as practised by Heritage Canada and agencies such as the Canada Council retains the integrity of the objective for providing support in the first place .
i for one am glad that the Government of Canada supports the Canada Council and I believe that most Canadians are of the same mind .
the bill would place the government in the awkward position of saying that the focus of public support for culture is not culture itself but government visibility .
this would unnecessarily thwart the development of the government ' s relations with the cultural community and its many public and media supporters .
compliance is presently assured by more informal means .
groups and individuals know their future funding could be placed in jeopardy should they refuse to play by the rules and respect what are very reasonable requirements for acknowledgement .
split payments in the case of grants and the specific negotiated schedules of payment for contributions and loans additionally serve as an informal mechanism to draw attention to the importance of acknowledgement .
i believe Bill C - 204 is unnecessary and will not be supporting it .
Ms. Wendy Lill ( Dartmouth , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to speak to Bill C - 204 , an act to require that in the advertising and at the opening of a cultural product supported by public money a public acknowledgement of the grant be made .
i am happy to bring the good news to the hon. member for Kootenay - Columbia that what he is proposing to pass into law is already occurring .
it is something which cultural industries are already doing voluntarily .
if he has ever had opportunity to attend a Canadian play he will find that in the program routine acknowledgements of all funding sources , public and private , are made .
if he has been at the screening of a Canadian film lately he will be amazed at the length of the section in the credits dedicated exclusively to the funders .
it seems to stretch out forever , longer than the credits acknowledging the film ' s crew .
in fact I sometimes squirm about in my seat in the local movie theatre waiting for the acknowledgements to end so that I can get home , pay the babysitter and go to bed .
the long suffering taxpayers who attend our cultural events do know what the funding sources are in Canadian plays , films , books , magazines and concerts .
it is no secret that almost every arts organization receives some level of funding and makes it public .
they do not always attach the dollar amount publicly at the event .
that is not why people go to an artistic event .
they go to be elevated , delighted , challenged and revitalized .
they go to learn something new about themselves and the world .
however , if after seeing a particular artistic event they feel the need to find out how much it costs , the dollar amount is available for anyone who wants to know through an annual Canada Council for the Arts listing .
Canadian cultural industries are grateful and eager to thank the funders of their work .
Canadians working in the arts are proud of their work and proud to present it to their neighbours and fellow citizens and , yes , their fellow taxpayers .
as for the desire for acknowledgement I am sure the Liberals who are still remaining across the floor tonight at this late hour are probably delighted to hear that we want to see their efforts at public funding for the arts made more public .
i believe that the level of public funding to culture has reached a dangerously low level and I see no joy in this .
i would like to see the level of support for our artists increased .
public funding to the arts still exists and I know of no one who is trying to keep it a secret .
if the member is really intent on educating the public about where its hard earned tax dollars go , and this is not simply another bill to harass Canadian artists , I suggest that he go even further in his public education efforts .
the next time he pulls into an Esso station he might expect to find a sign saying " This gas has been made possible by $ 585 million in tax breaks to western oil producers '' .
or , when he buys his next Michelin tire he might see a sign saying " Brought to you by a $ 27 million gift from the long suffering taxpayers of Nova Scotia by the Liberals in an election year '' .
the next time the member for Kootenay - Columbia takes a flight back to his riding he could have a sign on the back of his jacket saying how much that flight is costing the taxpayers of Canada .
we can put a price tag on everything if we want to .
there is a myth afoot that there is no accountability in the arts.
in fact , there are far more checks and balances in place around funding to the arts than there are around funding to corporations .
perhaps the member ' s next private member ' s bill might tackle that particular sector if he is concerned with the long - suffering taxpayer .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I really wish there were questions and comments because I would like to throw some questions at the hon. member who just spoke .
during his introduction of this bill , the member for Kootenay - Columbia used some examples that are very offensive , particularly to women .
the use of taxpayers ' money in the production of some of these so - called art things are pornographic and demeaning , particularly to women .
surely he cannot be in favour of using taxpayers ' money for that .
i am not and I do not think any decent Canadian is in favour of that , yet it is done all the time with impugnity .
we give money to agencies without the need for accountability .
we simply say " here is the money , spend it any way you wish '' .
they find some of the most obscene ways to spend it .
i wish I would have known I was going to get up to speak because I would have brought along with me a little more detail on a little thing I heard one night on CBC radio .
it was a usual Sunday evening and I was about to hit the pillow for the night .
well , it was after midnight on a Saturday night and the time of night when the culture of CBC does a metamorphoses .
maybe there is a connection to it being after midnight , I do not know , but I was totally appalled at what I was hearing on a publicly funded radio station , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation .
it was incredibly obscene .
i guess maybe it is a good thing I could not research it because then I would have brought the words along .
i was so offended by it that I ran downstairs to put on the tape recorder because I wanted to have a record of it .
unfortunately I could not find a tape soon enough and missed most of it .
i wanted to make a scene about that but I never did .
instead I ran for Parliament and came here with one real good purpose which is to stop the funding for this kind of obscenity .
it has no market in Canadian society .
we need to stop it .
it is no wonder we have all the violence against women and children when we have a publicly funded radio promoting it .
i think the member ' s bill is a very important step to making Canadians realize that when this type of stuff is being put out it is being financed with their tax dollars , tax dollars that will not go to the education of their children or to keeping a hospital bed open for a mother who is suffering and who needs it .
instead it is being used for this kind of garbage .
the first step in stopping this flow of taxpayers ' money has to be for the Canadian people to a large extent to know how it is being spent .
once they know how it is spent , they will get angry enough to tell their politicians in Ottawa to stop that flow of their money and use it for purposes that are much better and more justifiable .
i just could not resist adding that little bit to the debate on this bill .
i commend my hon. colleague for presenting it .
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) :
well , maybe not perturbed but perhaps concerned and it generated in him the desire to address some of the comments that were made by her and indeed some of the comments in the bill itself .
having heard the debate as he did , I too am moved to speak .
the comments of my hon. colleague just prior to my rising made me more determined to speak .
they give the indication more than anything else about what the intention of this bill really is .
it is an attempt to use dollars -
an hon. member :
if you would have heard what I heard on CBC -
Mr. Peter Mancini :
i have heard many things on CBC that have offended me .
i have heard many things in the private broadcasting sector that offend me more .
i note that in this bill there is no requirement for the private sector to indicate the influence it may have on cultural events that take place .
there is no accountability there .
i get the sense we want to go back to the way it was in the time of Caterina de ' Medici when certain privileged groups were patrons of the arts.
in that case individuals with gifts and abilities were supported by private patrons instead of the public .
then an individual may have used his creativity to write love songs for his patron ' s mistress .
i don ' t know .
we have come a long way .
my colleague from Dartmouth explained it like this .
we go to a public event to be educated , sometimes to be offended .
we do not go to be offended but sometimes we are .
we go to be stirred .
we go to be enlightened .
we go to create the kind of debate we are having here today .
if there were no public funding for the films mentioned , for some of the plays that have been written in this country , for some of the music that some colleagues or I might find offensive , then we would not have this debate .
we would hear endless reams of Lawrence Welk playing on some radio station that could be the most general and least offensive type of music that anyone could listen to .
the reality is artists need to be supported in their creative efforts .
we listen to the sitcoms that come across the border every day because nobody asks the sponsors how much money they have spent , and I think that is the intent of this bill .
i speak in favour of the freedom of the artist to express himself or herself .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the time for private members ' business this evening is just about over .
it is customary to allow the mover of the bill to wrap up for a couple of minutes .
if the mover does so , that will suspend debate on the bill .
if you will forgive the Chair an editorial comment , I think most Canadians watching would agree that tonight ' s debate in private members ' business was very good insofar as it was extemporaneous and heartfelt .
from the perspective of the Chair it was a very good debate .
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , indeed the speaker prior to myself put his finger on it .
if we do not like the sitcoms we are looking at that have been prepared at the expense of the studio and paid for by the sponsors , we turn them off at no cost to ourselves because the sponsors are the people who are paying the bill .
in an instance when Canadians are paying the bill , how is this House held accountable ?
the speaker spoke of the right of artistic expression .
that is a wonderful term .
the reality is that I receive on a weekly basis at least a dozen letters from concerned Canadians saying that they are being taxed to death .
they take a look at the material that is being produced and find it vile and offensive .
who is accountable ?
when we have this speaker from the NDP and the Minister of Canadian Heritage comparing today ' s vile pornographers to the Group of Seven , I find that a leap that is a chasm far too wide .
what this bill is about and indeed what we should be talking about in this House of Commons , the action we should be taking in this House of Commons is to hold this House of Commons accountable for the taxpayers ' dollars , whether it is going out to the Canada Council or it is going out to health care .
whatever it is going out to , I am here because the people sent me here to be accountable .
indeed I have gone to the artists , as I mentioned in the finance committee , I have gone to the minister in the heritage committee and now I come to this House .
apart from Reform members of Parliament , there is no one in this House of Commons who is prepared to stand to be accountable for the Canadian taxpayers ' dollars and the way in which they are being spent .
that is a shame .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the time provided for the consideration of private members ' business has now expired and the order is dropped from the order paper .
adjournment PROCEEDINGS
a motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved .
pay EQUITY
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , on October 3 , on pay equity , I asked the President of the Treasury Board if he intended to return to the bargaining table with the Public Service Alliance of Canada .
the question arose from a response the minister had made several days previously , one of the clearest ones he has made on the subject of the decision by the tribunal of the human rights commission in the matter before us .
the minister responded , and I quote " We stand ready to apply the various judgments once they are made final '' .
the minister has just now told us that he will abide by the tribunal ' s decision .
i must confess I had doubts about the seriousness of the minister ' s word .
in fact , following this surprising response , I wondered whether , with this statement , the President of the Treasury Board was announcing his withdrawal from the bargaining table .
while we all know that it was the employer who broke off negotiations , the minister told me that he was quietly waiting for the union to come back to the bargaining table , and went on about his $ 1.3 billion offer .
the employees are not stupid .
they know very well that the minister is trying to get them to settle for less .
i know that my hon. colleague will soon rise in the House to tell us proudly that bargaining resumed on October 30 .
i wonder whether my colleague will be honest enough , however , to admit that he is not even in a position to offer a settlement larger than $ 1.3 billion , when he knows full well that the Public Service Alliance is demanding close to $ 2 billion .
i look forward to hearing him boast about his wonderfully charitable offer .
let it be known that , with Christmas around the corner , what the government owes its employees is not charity , but simple and fair justice .
and this justice presumes the payment of the money to which they are entitled .
instead of asking me to use my influence with the unions to get them to accept this second - rate offer , I suggest that the minister should instead use his influence with the Minister of Finance to obtain the necessary room to manoeuvre and finally respect public servants .
if my hon. colleague replies in this vein , I will believe him .
better yet , I will say that he wants such a rapid settlement that he is using all the stalling tactics at his disposal .
if I may , I would like to give you some examples of what seem to some to be bargaining tactics , and to others , simple bad faith .
given that the tribunal ' s decision will not be handed down until the spring of 1998 and that this issue has been dragging on for 10 years , it is clear that everything is in place to rush employees into accepting a second - rate offer .
let us also remember that there is still the threat of special legislation .
we honestly believed in the government ' s good faith when we learned of the return to the bargaining table , but the tactics being used to influence employees are shocking .
when I read an information bulletin issued to employees , which points out how the settlement process will drag on if the employer ' s offer is rejected , I cannot help thinking that this is a tactic intended to influence their decision .
in conclusion , I understand that bargaining must include a minimum of strategy , but the government must also understand that its employees are not its enemies .
they too are taking part in the public effort .
the government must work with , not against , its employees .
i have only this to add : do the fair thing .
Mr. Ovid L . Jackson ( Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board , Lib . ) :
the government will continue to fulfill its obligations to pay equity .
as part of its commitment , it enacted legislation for Canada in 1978 .
it has paid over $ 1 billion in pay equity payments .
during the most recent negotiations it has offered $ 1.3 billion to PSAC .
on August 11 , 1997 the government tabled an offer of $ 1.3 billion to resolve the pay equity dispute .
on October 30 , PSAC tabled a counterproposal to the current Treasury Board offer of $ 1.3 billion .
in addition to salary adjustments that represent more than $ 2 billion , the PSAC counterproposals include interest back to 1983 , compensation for hurt feelings and other related costs .
the government believes that a negotiated settlement would be in the best interests of all parties and would end the uncertainty to employees .
the tribunal decision will provide the parameters for calculating the pay equity gap but will most likely leave some issues unresolved and this will require further discussions with PSAC .
this means further delays .
furthermore , any of the parties could file a judicial review .
negotiations will allow the employer and PSAC to resolve this matter and show that the trust and commitment can generate solutions to these difficult issues .
a joint resolution will get the cheques in the hands of the employees sooner .
the government is firmly committed to the principles of pay equity and it wants a fair , speedy and equitable solution to the dispute with PSAC .
foreign AFFAIRS
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , earlier I asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs if , in the spirit of the Beijing conference on women , he would assure that funding for the women ' s group going to APEC this week in Vancouver would be there , as I had had calls from my constituents who are members of women ' s groups and who were not getting any funding to go .
the minister said that funding had been there and it was up to the groups to decide what to do with it .
these citizens groups represent human rights groups , women ' s organizations , environment workers , migrant workers and anti - poverty groups .
APEC represents 18 countries .
it is an association of economies and its goal is to pursue unfettered trade , unfettered meaning it does not have to deal with human rights or workers rights or the fact there may be child labour or forced labour .
the people ' s summit was an attempt to bring a balance to this process .
these countries are home to 2.2 billion people , which is 40 % of our globe ' s humanity .
in 1993 the world conference on human rights in Vienna restated that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and inter - related .
APEC ' s agenda is to separate trade as having nothing to do with human rights or workers rights , the very people who produce the money for transnational corporations and large economies .
they do have rights .
that is not the way APEC sees it .
APEC curtails democracy through informal understandings .
democratic countries align themselves with the most repressive and corrupt regimes in the world while at the same time shutting out the voices of the civil society .
there is also the argument that better trade will increase human rights .
however , when trade agreements changed in China in 1988 and 1989 we saw the Tiananmen massacre .
in Indonesia there continue to be vile human rights abuses , yet in the name of trade we will meet with these people and everything will be fine as long as it is in the name of the dollar .
the countries of APEC and the corporations of APEC , some elected , some unelected , refuse to discuss their impact on human rights , on working conditions , the freedom to associate , the freedom to negotiate , child labour , forced labour , environmental standards , immigration , migrant labour and their affect on indigenous peoples .
again I will state that the indigenous group had to pull out because there was no funding for it .
it is easy to shut out the voices of civil society because they are not funded equally by any standards ; $ 57 million to APEC , $ 200,000 to the people ' s summit .
they were not allowed to participate .
there was no money for transportation .
even transferring the cost of one business reception would likely have covered every expense needed for the people ' s summit .
it would have allowed them to fully participate .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member , but her time has expired .
Mr. Ovid L . Jackson ( Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to respond to the hon. member for Yukon on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
the Government of Canada has provided almost $ 200,000 in funding for many non - governmental organizations under the umbrella of the people ' s summit .
this financial support is given through the departments of foreign affairs and international trade and CIDA , under whose aegis APEC is taking place .
in addition , Status of Women Canada has provided support for the domestic workers forum held on November 15 and 16 , 1997 , to allow participants to discuss the impact of economic restructuring on their lives and to facilitate their participation in the decision making process .
status of Women Canada will continue to work with women ' s organizations to develop long term domestic follow - up action to the people ' s summit , to contribute to Canada ' s efforts to recognize gender as a cross - cutting issue in APEC .
we have already seen progress in three key areas of APEC ' s economic and technical co - operation agenda : small and medium enterprises , science and technology , and human resource development .
the Government of Canada is also working with APEC economies to incorporate more formally a women ' s agenda at future APEC meetings .
our government ' s financial support is intended to strengthen the capacity of Canadian NGOs to contribute to the development of APEC policies and programs .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted .
accordingly , this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at two o ' clock , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
( the House adjourned at 7.39 p.m. )

as is our practice on Wednesday we will now sing O Canada , and we will be led by the hon. member for Halifax West .
statements BY MEMBERS
CANADIAN BUSINESS MAP
Mr. Janko Peric ( Cambridge , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canadian businesses wishing to compete in the global market often face hurdles in obtaining timely information on financing , laws and natural and human resources in the provinces and municipalities in which they wish to invest .
to address these challenges , the Minister of Industry launched a powerful new business support web site called the Canadian Business Map .
the Canadian Business Map provides links to over 3,500 municipal , provincial , national and international government and private sector sites .
the introduction of this new product by Industry Canada shows that this government recognizes the need to support Canadian business in this competitive and information age .

equality
Mr. Derrek Konrad ( Prince Albert , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , Liberals it seems believe in nothing and therefore can stand for absolutely everything .
let us take equality .
liberals say that everyone in Canada is equal .
their vision of equality however is summed up in George Orwell ' s novel Animal Farm where he wrote that all animals are created equal , only some are created more equal than others .
this represents the Liberal vision for Canada .
equality is linked with unity and I suggest that Liberals start thinking about the benefits of true equality .
yesterday a majority of Canadian premiers added an official aboriginal position to the Calgary declaration on national unity .
now if the Liberal government believes in equality and national unity , I invite it to take a stand here and ensure that grassroots aboriginals , not just the leadership , have a say in the Calgary declaration .
Mr. Speaker , I ask you : would not true equality be a tremendous unifying principle for such a great country ?
* * *
2310 ARMY CADET CORPS
Mr. Carmen Provenzano ( Sault Ste. Marie , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wish today to congratulate Sault Ste. Marie ' s number 2310 Army Cadet Corps on its upcoming 50 th anniversary .
since its establishment in 1948 , the corps has given over 5,000 young Saultites a chance to develop leadership skills and improve their physical fitness .
it has also taught them civic responsibility and respect for Canada ' s rich military history .
past and present instructors at the 2310 can take pride in the fact that they have helped prepare young Saultites for both the challenges and opportunities of adult life .
it is for this reason that former Sault army cadets have met with success in many walks of life .
it is also for this reason that the lessons learned by our cadets truly become lifelong lessons .
i therefore invite all former cadets and their families to participate in the corps ' 50 th -

ASTER SCIENTIFIC STATION
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
this award goes to Canadian and Quebec organizations that have contributed to advancing , promoting and popularizing science .
the station ' s director , Guylaine Carri 猫 re , received the award at a prize giving ceremony yesterday at the Science World Hot Seat Theatre in Vancouver , British Columbia .
the achievements of the Aster scientific station are many .
they include the establishment of the Inforoute Globe - Trotter summer camp in co - operation with the Conseil du loisir scientifique de l ' est du Qu 茅 bec and Industry Canada .
there is as well the L 茅 onard workshop , which has enabled students in mechanical and electrical engineering at the University of Quebec at Rimouski to come in contact with an impressive range of engineering fields .
on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois , my congratulations to the entire dynamic team of the Aster scientific station in the T 茅 miscouata region .
* * *
Ms. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to take this opportunity to recognize and congratulate Mr. Peter Ruderman , a constituent of Etobicoke - Lakeshore , for his tremendous volunteer efforts in assisting a state - run medical fund to make a successful and efficient transition to a private fund in Kazakhstan .
as a volunteer with the Canadian Executive Service Organization , Mr. Ruderman shared his expertise on the organization of the Canadian health care system through a series of lectures and discussions with health care professionals .
Mr. Ruderman ' s work is an example of the spirit of volunteerism .
the people of Etobicoke - Lakeshore are proud of his efforts .
congratulations , Mr. Ruderman .
* * *
Mr. Denis Paradis ( Brome - Missisquoi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the goals of Katimavik are simple : to allow young people to develop through community service and to enable them to become aware of their environment by knowing and understanding Canada better .
in other words , Katimavik allows a young person to share the life of a Canadian family in a new community , to live differently , to work for a non - profit organization and , generally , to improve his or her skills in the other language .
a real school of life , I would say .
the student work exchanges we initiated in Brome - Missisquoi two years ago must continue and develop along the same lines .
a number of colleagues in this House want to be part of this student exchange program next summer .
i head a committee working on this , and I invite suggestions from all my colleagues .
if Katimavik could become the vehicle of choice for this summertime exchange program , I think young people across Canada now and in the future will be thanking Senator Jacques H 茅 bert .

golden WEDDING ANNIVERSARY
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise to extend on behalf of Her Majesty ' s Loyal Opposition and all of the people of Canada greetings and best wishes to Her Majesty the Queen and His Royal Highness Prince Philip on the occasion of their Golden Wedding Anniversary .
they were married 50 years ago tomorrow .
it was the 11 th year of the reign of King George VI.
Britain was beset by economic problems .
Monarchies and democracies in half of Europe had fallen under the hammer of Soviet communism .
the empire , which Canada helped to defend through the dark days of the second world war , was coming apart .
at 11.15 on the morning of November 20 , 1947 , Princess Elizabeth , then 19 years old , set out from Buckingham Palace in the Irish state coach from Westminster Abbey where she was given in marriage by her father , the King , to 25 - year old Royal Navy Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten .
the Leader of the Official Opposition , Winston Churchill , described the royal wedding of 1947 as " a flash of colour on the hard road we have to travel '' .
i join with all Canadians in marking this bright moment in a year marked by tragedy for our royal family .
god save the Queen .
* * *
ELGIN REGIMENT
Mr. Gar Knutson ( Elgin - Middlesex - London , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I stand today in recognition of the Elgin regiment .
this fine military unit has recently received the official designation as a combat engineering regiment of the 31 st Canadian brigade group .
the Elgin regiment dates back to 1866 with the establishment of the 25 th Elgin battalion of infantry .
the regiment was called out on active service on several occasions and served during World Wars I and II , earning numerous battle honours .
as an engineering regiment , they now typically will participate in cleaning land mines and building bridges as well as many other ways of contributing to our peacekeeping mandate .
history has shown that the members of the Elgin regiment are used to change .
serving first as an infantry battalion and subsequently assuming armoured and reconnaissance status , the Elgin regiment now embarks upon a new chapter in its long and proud history as the 31 st combat engineering regiment , the Elgins .
i want to congratulate the members of this regiment and say that I am proud to represent such a committed group of Canadian citizens .
* * *
goods AND SERVICES TAX
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the only Quebec MPs who are opposed to the proposal for independent arbitration to settle the matter of GST harmonization in Quebec and the $ 2 billion in compensation are the Liberal MPs .
all of the Quebec Liberal MPs in this House have spoken out against the interests of their own constituents , against a non - partisan process to settle the Ottawa - Quebec dispute , against a unanimous request by the members of the socioeconomic summit in Quebec , and against a position expressed by all of the provincial premiers at St. Andrews .
all of the federal Liberal MPs for Quebec , who are again down on all fours , have again shown how justified Quebeckers are in their massive support of the only party devoted to defending their interests in Ottawa : the Bloc Quebecois .
* * *
EGYPT
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Pierrefonds - Dollard , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , like everyone else , I was horrified by the shocking images transmitted by Egyptian television after the carnage involving more than 60 innocent tourists in front of the temple of Hatchepsut in Luxor .
this massacre , for which the group al - Gamaa al - Islamiya has taken credit , demonstrates just how irresponsible its perpetrators are and , in the long run , accomplishes nothing except to push back peace efforts .
i wish to express our sincere condolences to the relatives of the victims , and to assure the Egyptian people of our support in their fight against terrorism .
* * *
APEC SUMMIT
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , today marks the beginning of the APEC summit in Vancouver .
APEC represents the fastest growing market in the world with a combined GNP of over $ 22 trillion .
as host , Canada has the opportunity to showcase Vancouver , North America ' s third busiest port , which boasts a booming economy and state of the art communication and transportation links .
however , if Canada is to truly prosper , this government must take the necessary steps to remain competitive .
this government must lower personal , corporate and payroll taxes which deter investment , growth and job creation .
it must break down interprovincial trade barriers which stifle growth and inhibit international competitiveness .
there is no question that Canadians across the country will benefit from increased trade with Asia - Pacific .
the question is , will the government be proactive , reduce taxes and prove to the world that Canada is indeed open for business .

drug PRICES
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , skyrocketing drug costs are threatening the future of medicare and putting an impossible burden on Canadians who need medically necessary drugs .
liberal policies are to blame .
who is in charge ?
why is the big brand name drug company running this country ?
today , on behalf of seniors everywhere and Canadians who are concerned about the future of medicare , we call on this government to ensure need , not greed , is the basis of drug pricing policy in Canada .

fisheries
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Liberal government and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans have obviously forgotten about the people in Atlantic Canada who want to improve the economy of their local fishing communities .
for the past six months , the Canso Trawlerman ' s Co - op Limited has been actively pursuing an Enterprise Allocation to put 60 people in Nova Scotia back to work .
since May of this year , these hard - working individuals in the co - op have made every effort to get the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to meet with them in Canso , one of Atlantic Canada ' s oldest and most historic fishing communities .
unfortunately , the minister has refused these repeated requests .
co - op members have nevertheless met with the minister ' s former caucus colleague , who is now the current Premier of Nova Scotia , in efforts to gain support for the co - op ' s cause .
on behalf of the Canso Trawlerman ' s Co - op , I urge the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to meet with the co - op members from Canso to listen to their concerns and address these proposals in a direct and positive manner .

national DAY OF THE CHILD
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Ahuntsic , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , tomorrow the people of Canada will be marking the fifth National Day of the Child .
this is an opportunity for us all to focus on the important place children hold in our society .
it is our responsibility as members of Parliament , and in a number of cases also as parents and grandparents , to ensure that each of our children in Canada does not live in poverty , die of hunger , fall victim to sexual abuse , or be exploited for the purpose of pornography or prostitution .
the National Crime Prevention Council which our government established during its first mandate has provided us with blueprints for developing and implementing prevention strategies that invest in children and our youth .
i would like to draw particular attention to the exceptional work done by the volunteers and administrators of the NGOs in my riding of Ahuntsic , among them Alternatives Jeunesse , Maison Buissoni 猫 re , and the Centre Mariebourg .
speaking on behalf of all the children of Ahuntsic , my congratulations to them all .
we have a responsibility as parliamentarians to leave this world a little better .
oral QUESTIONS
canada POST
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , for weeks Canadians have been enduring the threats and counter threats of strikes and lockouts at Canada post .
the government says that negotiations will produce a settlement .
but last night we got the chief negotiator for Canada post and the negotiators for the union wrestling on the floor in Hull .
they are going to be on WWF next .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the parties are discussing and apparently there was a lively meeting yesterday .
those things happen once in a while .
but I think it is in the best interests of the workers that there is a system of negotiated settlement , and we do hope there will be one .
they have a right to have a union and the right to negotiate .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , strikes , lockouts , even back to work legislation are traditional instruments of the past and they do not work .
none of these are protecting the long term consumer interest and the delivery of the mail .
we are asking the government why it does not use some creative thinking to change the labour dispute settling mechanism , like final offer arbitration .
my question is , why will the government not legislate final offer arbitration for Canada post ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , mostly because final offer arbitration does not work .
the government wants a collective agreement and it wants both sides to sit down .
as the Prime Minister indicated , there was a lively meeting last night .
we want them to settle down and come up with a collective agreement that will be better for CUPW , the post office and for the people of Canada .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , if final offer arbitration does not work , why is it the mechanism that is included in the Canada Transportation Act to settle disputes between shippers and the railways ?
if the government does not want to intervene in the bargaining process , why does it not fix the process ?
why will the minister not act in the long term public interest and legislate a long term solution to Canada post labour problems ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , collective agreements under the federal jurisdiction have worked over 94 % of the time .
we want them back at the table to come up with an agreement that will serve us all well .
* * *
CALGARY DECLARATION
Mr. Rahim Jaffer ( Edmonton - Strathcona , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , on the first sitting day of this Parliament , I asked the Prime Minister if he would be consulting Quebeckers on the Calgary declaration since Lucien Bouchard was not going to .
he said maybe .
i asked the same question a few weeks ago and was told that the government was not planning anything in this regard .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , a process is currently under way to hold consultations in all the other provinces .
we are waiting to see what the outcome will be .
if it is appropriate to consult Quebeckers afterwards , we will see to it .
we are not saying that we will not hold consultations in Quebec but at the same time we are not saying that we will .
* * *
taxation
Mr. Gerry Ritz ( Battlefords - Lloydminster , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions admitted something that ordinary Canadians have always known .
he said that the Liberals are " very familiar with the fact that our income taxes are very high '' .
this is quite an admission from the Liberals .
now that we all know our taxes are very high , when will the government do the responsible thing and bring in some tax relief ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in the 1997 budget the government brought in $ 2 billion worth of tax relief .
we brought in tax relief for students .
we brought in tax relief for the physically disabled .
we brought in tax relief for poor families with children .
the real issue before the Canadian people is why the Reform Party opposed that tax relief to Canadians .
* * *
canada POST
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the minister responsible for the Canada Post Corporation said we should be pleased because negotiations had resumed between the two sides .
later in the evening , while the union announced that talks had officially resumed , Canada Post officials were saying that negotiations had broken down .
we also know that a rather disgraceful incident took place yesterday .
can the minister responsible for the Canada Post Corporation tell the House what has happened since yesterday to make things go sour ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , first we deplore the incident that occurred late last night .
this morning , I asked the chairman of Canada Post to provide me with a report , which I received around noon .
from now on , the corporation ' s director of labour relations , Raymond Poirier , will lead the employer ' s negotiating team .
as for the negotiations , efforts are currently being made to get the process under way again .
just before the incident , yesterday , negotiations were going ahead .
i hope they can be resumed this afternoon .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , what happened yesterday is that while the union was announcing that negotiations were resuming , management was refusing to answer the telephone , to talk to journalists and to discuss with the union .
could the minister convey a message to his new negotiator and tell him to stop these delaying tactics , to sit down and to negotiate in good faith for once ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I believe the two sides negotiated continuously for over 24 hours .
yesterday , in the evening , an incident which we deplore took place .
since this morning , efforts are being made to get the two sides back to the table .
i hope that by the end of the day they can go back to the table and negotiate .
the government ' s objective is to have a negotiated collective agreement .
Mr. R 茅 jean Lefebvre ( Champlain , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for Canada Post .
since August , the minister responsible for Canada Post has been warning the union that special legislation would be brought in if there was a strike .
this week again , the minister said that the union ' s tough stand would result in the privatization of Canada Post .
will the minister admit that by promising back to work legislation in the event of a strike , he is guaranteeing the employer ' s bad faith and making it impossible to bargain in good faith ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I never promised back to work legislation or privatization , on the contrary .
what I have been saying since last week , since there has been the possibility of a strike or lock - out , is that right now Canada Post is losing in excess of $ 10 million daily .
clearly , if this goes on for several weeks , we will then have a very serious situation on our hands and tough action will be necessary .
the government will assume its responsibilities .
Mr. R 茅 jean Lefebvre :
Mr. Speaker , does the minister not see that his obvious bias in favour of the employer is making him the leading cause of the present breakdown in negotiations ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am the minister responsible for Canada Post .
my responsibility is to make sure that all Canadians receive the best postal service possible .
that is therefore what I am doing and I hope that the opposition parties will be able to work with the government and ask either the union or Canada Post to return to the bargaining table and work out a contract .

pharmaceuticals
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Industry .
by the year 2000 Canadians will have paid over $ 600 million extra for their prescription drugs , a penalty imposed on Canadians because the government caved in to the multinational drug lobby .
for 18 months the industry minister has kept reports of these extra secret costs while the minister whispers sweet nothings about a national pharmacare program .
could the industry minister explain why the government always sides with the big multinationals instead of taking care of people who need drugs , the poor and the sick ?
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the drug patent policy is a controversial one .
it was reviewed by a committee of the House of Commons during the past winter .
the purpose of the policy , from our point of view , is quite simple .
we will respect our international commitments under the WTO to give 20 year patent protection for intellectual property , not just for drugs but for all intellectual property .
we will try to endeavour to ensure that the moment the patent protection ends mechanisms will be in place to ensure that alternative drugs are there .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the intervention of the government and the minister into the work of the parliamentary committee was a disgrace to democracy .
Canadians are paying heavily with their health and with their pocketbooks for the minister ' s refusal to overhaul our drug patent laws .
will the government make it a priority to look after the weakest members of our society instead of siding with the multinationals which contribute to the coffers of the governing party ?
or , did the minister take an oath to serve the interests of the multinational drug companies instead of the Canadian people ?
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am surprised the question is in order , but I think it is important to note that what has the NDP inflamed is really only a very small portion of the total costs of health care in the country , namely the differential that may exist between patented medicines and non - patented medicines .
they obviously have no interest in respecting intellectual property .
nor are they making any arguments based upon the laws that stand , the regulations as they exist .
nor have they made any practical , lawful suggestions to us that we could -

employment INSURANCE
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
will the Minister of Human Resources Development share the same information with the House of Commons today ?
if not , why not ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am not exactly sure to what information the hon. member is referring .
if she shared it with me I could give her a more appropriate answer .
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) :
the Canadian business community knows about it .
high payroll taxes kill jobs .
the government is refusing to accept this and the advice of its own actuary which shows that EI premiums could be cut significantly .
will the minister , based on the actuarial report , reduce the EI premiums immediately and table the report ?
and I have it , Mr. Speaker .
the Speaker :
let us not use any props in the House .
if the minister wants to answer the question , he may .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , obviously I did not know the member was referring to that very public report , if the member was asking for it .
i thought the member was referring to a more specific piece of information .
if the member is referring to that report , I can say the government has already reduced the EI premium four times .
her government was about to put it higher once again .
that is what it wanted .
thank God we have been around for awhile .

labour RELATIONS BOARD
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , when it comes to eating , even the snack pack cannot compete with Ted Weatherill , the chair of the Canada Labour Relations Board .
Mr. Weatherill spent $ 148,000 on snacks in his first eight years as chair .
yet the Liberal government is waiting six months in investigation before it will consider his dismissal .
how many more $ 733 lunches for two in Paris does the minister need before he cans this half million dollar man ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the auditor general will be reporting to the House on the issue in the next couple of weeks .
until then I have no comments on the issue .
* * *
human RIGHTS
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , at the Vancouver APEC summit the government is hosting among others leaders from Indonesia , Thailand , Vietnam and China .
Canadians want the Minister of Foreign Affairs to loudly and publicly raise our concerns about human right abuses with these countries , not behind close doors but loudly and publicly .
while in opposition this minister was talking the talk .
now is the time .
will he walk the walk ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as I already reported to the House , last summer specifically we were in Jakarta .
we raised all the issues the hon. member is concerned about .
as a result of raising those issues we came to an agreement to establish a human rights dialogue .
the first colloquium under that dialogue was held two or three weeks ago for East Timor .
the questions concerning prisoners were all raised .
for the first time we had a number of NGOs involved .
i think that shows real constructive progress in terms of dealing with human rights with Indonesia .
* * *
monetary POLICY
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , although the inflation rate has dropped to 1.5 % , the Governor of the Bank of Canada still fears the inflation ghost and has announced that he will increase interest rates .
yet , the mandate of the central bank is clear : it also has to look after employment , not just inflation .
my question is to the Minister of Finance .
what is the minister waiting for to call Governor Thiessen to order and force him to fulfil the employment mandate provided for in the Bank of Canada Act ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the member is well aware that interest rates are really a reflection of inflation .
it is necessary to reduce expectations .
in fact , in the last three weeks , long term rates have gone down .
so the question is based on a false premise .
interest rates are down , and it is because of this government ' s monetary policy .
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , what a revelation !
has the Minister of Finance , who during the 1995 referendum campaign was saying that a sovereign Quebec would be in a losing position because it would have no control over monetary policy , just admitted candidly that even he has no control over monetary policy ?
is the Minister of Finance aware that his lack of monetary policy in the last three years is hurting the unemployed in Quebec ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , if the member is so concerned about the economic situation in Quebec , perhaps he should read the study by the French Ministry of the Economy , which calls for a temporary lifting of the referendum burden .
perhaps he will listen to the French people who blame the whole referendum question and the political uncertainty in Quebec for Canada ' s high interest rates .

environment
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am going to ask another question on Kyoto today because we are still waiting for real answers from the government .
before I ask it , however , I am going to give the government ' s response , or at least the tired old comments it has made to avoid giving a real answer .
the environment minister will say what is Reform ' s plan , which is typical of a government that has run out of ideas .
or , the minister will say they are taking this very seriously , which is a nice thought but does not answer the question I am about to ask .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the federal government will work with all partners in Canada to implement a plan to deal with the issue seriously , the real issue of climate change .
there will be a package of measures on the table and there will be a consensus in the country about what we do .
what will the Reform Party do ?
everybody in the country would like to know .
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , we still do not know what the government will do in Kyoto , and it is 13 days away .
we know two things , though .
the government will sign a binding agreement .
it wants to be greener than the U.S. The Prime Minister wants to be greener than the U.S. The minister will not tell us what she will do and what the promises will be .
the first thing we want out of the government is a commitment on how much the CO 2 reductions will be .
next we want tabled in the House what it will cost Canadians .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , before the conference in Kyoto the federal government will make known its targets and timetables .
we will work out an implementation scheme with all of our partners after Kyoto .
all Canadians will be engaged in the issue of reducing climate change .
many of the measures that can be taken will be beneficial to the economy of Canada .
they will help all Canadians , not only in their pocketbooks but also in their health .

drug PATENTS
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie ( Louis - H 茅 bert , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , this spring the Standing Committee on Industry submitted its report on its examination of Bill C - 91 on the protection of drug patents .
the government is preparing its response to the report .
my question is for the Minister of Industry .
could he confirm that the government has no intention of shortening the 20 year period drug patents are protected , by amending neither the act nor the regulations , as the committee recommends in its unanimous report ?
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie ( Louis - H 茅 bert , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to hear that , because according to some sources quoted in today ' s papers , the Minister of Health wanted to change the regulations on drug patents .
would the Minister of Industry guarantee once again that the term of drug patents will in no way be reduced by amendments to the regulations ?
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the aim of the regulations was to give 20 years of protection to drug patents and not to extend or lessen the protection .
any changes to the regulations will be to -

aboriginal AFFAIRS
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canadians are very concerned about the devastating effects of alcohol and drug addiction on our native population .
the auditor general again confirms the vastness of this problem .
for 10 years Health Canada has known of and done nothing to correct the widespread abuse of easy access to prescription drugs .
given the inaction by this government , is it really the health minister ' s policy to pay for and condone the illegal use of prescription drugs within our aboriginal communities ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , what the hon. member should know is what we said three weeks ago when the auditor general ' s report was tabled , namely that we have been at work in Health Canada for some years putting in place across the land technology to ensure that pharmacists will be able to ascertain that every prescription presented is legitimate and should be filled .
that will be in place by the end of this calendar year .
it will save money and , more important , it will save lives .

tobacco SPONSORSHIP
Mr. Maurice Vellacott ( Wanuskewin , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government ' s previous minister of health made two conflicting promises .
first in the interest of Canadians ' health he promised to ban sponsorship advertising of cigarettes .
then later under pressure from the tobacco lobby he promised to reverse that ban for auto racing events .
which of these two promises does the current health minister believe to be more in keeping with the obligations of a minister of health ?

military PROCUREMENT
Mrs. Pierrette Venne ( Saint - Bruno - Saint - Hubert , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Defence .
yesterday , the minister confirmed that the government still intended to purchase several billion dollars worth of military equipment , such as tanks , submarines and so on .
since there have already been special debates in this House on significant issues , such as the deployment of troops to Bosnia , Haiti and other places , why does the government stubbornly refuse to hold a special debate on this issue , when several billion dollars are at stake ?
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
these purchases , Mr. Speaker , have been around for some period of time and certainly there has been every opportunity for the opposition to ensure that discussions were held and questions were in fact put on all these issues .
these matters are a point of making sure that we get the kind of equipment , the kind of tools that our Canadian forces need to be able to do their job .

national DEFENCE
Mr. John O ' Reilly ( Victoria - Haliburton , Lib . ) :
can the Minister of National Defence confirm that the Canadian military is indeed capable of any mission that it is asked to perform ?
will the Minister of National Defence tell General Pike that his attitude is not suitable to lead a high profile campaign in Bosnia and reaffirm that the Canadian military is second to none in the world ?
tell General Pike to take a hike .
hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) :
you bet , Mr. Speaker .
when I was in Bosnia recently , I met with General Ramsay , a British army officer who was in charge of the sector that the Canadian troops are serving in .
he had the highest praise for the capability , the professionalism and the performance of the Canadian troops in Bosnia and their humanitarian work .
i think that is more indicative of what the British army thinks .
in terms of Lieutenant - General Pike , it seems he does not think that women can reflect -

justice
Mr. Chuck Cadman ( Surrey North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , some months ago , the Minister of Justice tried to score points by expressing an interest in improving the rights of victims .
she stated : " We have not done enough to accommodate the interests of victims within the criminal justice system '' .
on October 7 she mocked a statement from this side of the House concerning a murdered woman by saying " and blah , blah , blah , blah '' .
now she has suggested an ombudsman for crime victims .
will this proposed appointee actually be authorized to enforce victims rights or will this just be another case of powerless blah , blah , blah Liberal patronage ?
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , let me reassure the hon. member that this government takes very seriously the issue of victims and victims rights .
in fact , that is why I intend to discuss this important issue with my provincial counterparts in Montreal a week and a half from now .

firearms
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the firearms act is being implemented in 1998 . Manitoba and three other provinces will not use provincial resources to force law abiding citizens to register their recreational firearms .
this leaves the federal RCMP .
how does the solicitor general expect an understaffed , underfunded RCMP to register millions of dastardly duck hunters ?
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the RCMP is fully prepared to do its job with regard to firearms legislation .
the regulations are being reviewed now and the RCMP is fully prepared to do its job .

ports
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , by now most of the members of this House and I am sure the Minister of Transport have heard the disturbing news reports of allegations made by Mr. Bruce Brine , the former director of the Halifax ports police .
he has made serious allegations of corruption and fraud by senior officials within the Canada ports police .
my question is for the Minister of Transport .
can the minister tell the House how much the minister knows about these allegations , when he knew and what steps his ministry and Canada Ports Corporation have undertaken to address these most -
the Speaker :
the hon. Minister of Transport .
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have been informed by Ports Canada that there have been allegations of wrongdoing involving the police detachment at Halifax .
this is now being looked into by the RCMP .
beyond that I have no further information .
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is interesting that the minister has no further information .
on June 17 , 1996 Mr. Brine met with senior officials of the Canada Ports Corporation .
at that meeting he detailed his allegations of corruption .
either the minister does not know about these allegations or someone in the corporation saw fit not to tell him .
will the minister assure the House that these allegations of criminal wrongdoing will be thoroughly and impartially investigated and not covered up ?
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I cannot think of a more thorough and impartial investigation than the one being conducted by the RCMP .
it will take all these matters into consideration .

canada PENSION PLAN
Mr. Jean Dub 茅 ( Madawaska - Restigouche , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , in 1995 the Department of Finance conducted a study on the impact of the increase in CPP premiums between 1986 and 1995 .
the department estimated that the increase in CPP premiums would lead to a loss of some 26,000 jobs .
could the Minister of Finance inform this House how many jobs will be lost this time with a 70 % CPP increase in premiums and is there a job impact analysis ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , what the study demonstrates is that as a result of the confidence that will be engendered in the Canada pension plan and the confidence that workers can have it will be there for them and over the long term this will lay a very strong foundation for increased employment .
Mr. Jean Dub 茅 ( Madawaska - Restigouche , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canadian workers had better keep their eyes open on this one .
until now , the Minister of Finance has shown no interest whatsoever in reducing employment insurance premiums .
if these are not reduced , the employment insurance account will have a $ 7 billion surplus , a $ 7 billion tax on jobs .
when Canada pension plan contributions are raised , still more jobs will be jeopardized .
would the Minister of Finance commit , once and for all , to offset the increases in pension plan contributions by reducing employment insurance premiums ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as the Minister of Human Resources Development has already indicated , we have cut employment insurance contributions every year since we came to power .
it must be pointed out that they were raised for three years during the previous government .
at the same time , looking at CPP contributions , I can state that it is true that , along with the provinces , we will be forced to raise them .
it is too bad that the previous government did not act in 1984 when there was still time .

[ editor ' s Note :
member spoke in Inuktitut ]
can the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development tell the House what steps her department is taking to ensure that Inuit are full participants in the public service of Nunavut ?
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the creation of the new territory of Nunavut is a priority for this government , as it is for the people of the Eastern Arctic .
i had the benefit of travelling with the hon. member to Iqaluit to announce a $ 40 million federal investment to that strategy .
to date 800 Inuit people have received training under this program .
i know that in April 1999 we will welcome them to their responsibility .

so why now the extra $ 22 million in government handouts ?
hon. Fred Mifflin ( Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State ( Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am not sure where the hon. member is getting his figures from .
what the prime minister said in the Atlantic visions conference was basically that the government supports Atlantic Canada in every way and will do the best it can for its recovery .

Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food .
we know that the Americans are challenging the price of Canadian milk for export .
the World Trade Organization was hearing the American complaint this morning .
this is a major issue for Quebec and Canadian dairy producers .
does the minister intend to vigorously defend the dairy producers of Quebec and Canada by taking a clear and firm stand in the face of American claims ?
hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , yes I will confirm that we will defend the Canadian dairy industry vigorously .
the government did that successfully when the United States challenged us in the NAFTA panel .
we defended the industry vigorously .
we succeeded then and we will defend the industry vigorously today and in the future .

Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday in the House the minister of public Works passionately said that he wanted a negotiated settlement between Canada Post and CUPW .
last night the parties were that close to a collective agreement .
also last night Eda Irwin , the spokesperson for Canada Post , then revealed to the press that she does not have a mandate to negotiate with this union .
what is going on ?
for the sake of all Canadians and Canadian business , when will this minister get off his chair and negotiate properly and give Canada Post the mandate it requires to negotiate ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canada Post has a mandate to negotiate and to have a negotiated settlement .
as the hon. member said , last night they were so close , and that is true .
we hope they can go back to the table and reach a settlement .

employment INSURANCE
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , we have received dozens of calls from Canadians who depend on government assistance cheques but who have not received them this month .
one gentleman said that he did not have enough money to purchase insulin because his EI cheque did not come .
last night a lady from St. John ' s had to rush her son to the hospital but did not have enough gas to get there .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we have looked very carefully at this situation .
most of the cheques that my department is delivering are going through the post .
we made an agreement last night with Canada Post which the postmen have accepted to deliver all delayed cheques today and tomorrow in case there is no agreement .
that has been done .
as a responsible government and as a responsible department this is what we have done because of the possibility of a strike .
we have organized 400 sites across the country for distribution in case of such a strike .

foreign AFFAIRS
Mr. Stan Dromisky ( Thunder Bay - Atikokan , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
despite the efforts of others to dictate Canadian foreign policy , Canada continues to develop a relationship with Cuba .
can the minister describe the latest developments in this relationship and explain how both countries will benefit ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his timely question .
in a series of these bilateral agreements we signed a joint declaration with the Cuban government which includes a series of meetings on human rights issues .
we have had very good meetings on women ' s rights and children ' s rights .
we are working with the Cubans on developing a covenant signing for the United Nations , another agreement on terrorism .
Mr. Speaker , you have received a delegation of Cuban parliamentarians to help shape the legislative system and legislative reforms in that country .
it shows real progress in constructive engagement .

veterans AFFAIRS
Mr. Peter Goldring ( Edmonton East , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , while a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force , I recall a conversation with a Hong Kong veteran .
Tom spoke of the brutality and torture he endured at the hands of the Japanese army during enslavement .
i find it unconscionable that our government 52 years later has still not insisted that Japan , one of the richest countries in the world , provide proper compensation for this enslavement and forced labour .
will the Minister of Veterans Affairs and the government act now for our Hong Kong veterans ' dignity and arrange proper compensation ?
hon. Fred Mifflin ( Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State ( Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I agree with the hon. member in the sense of the sacrifice the Hong Kong veterans made .
efforts have been made for extra contribution but up to now they have not been successful .
Hong Kong veterans are compensated by the Department of Veterans Affairs in a fair manner .
depending on the circumstances of their involvement in some cases they can get up to almost $ 60,000 .

department OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION
Mr. R 茅 al M 茅 nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , we read today in La Presse that the Department of Citizenship and Immigration apparently misled 430 of its Quebec employees by providing documents containing false information about work reorganization .
how can the minister justify the questionable practices , which have no precedent in the illustrious Canadian public service , of her senior officials with respect to Quebec public servants ?
hon. Lucienne Robillard ( Minister of Citizenship and Immigration , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Department of Citizenship and Immigration , like many other federal departments , has undergone a profound restructuring of its services on a nation - wide scale , and each of the regions has gone about attaining the objectives of this restructuring in its own way .
that having been said , certain employees dissatisfied with the approach taken by the Montreal office have appealed to the Public Service Commission and we intend to respect its decision .
the Speaker :
dear colleagues , that marks the end of Oral Question Period .

point OF ORDER
question PERIOD
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order that arises out of question period .
that is only appropriate seeing that the question that my leader asked was exactly the same question that the current Prime Minister asked on April 1 , 1993 -
the Speaker :
i thank the hon. member for his information .
routine PROCEEDINGS
interparliamentary DELEGATIONS
hon. Sheila Finestone ( Mount Royal , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 34 ( 1 ) , I have the honour to present to the House , in both official languages , the report of the Canadian group of the Interparliamentary Union which represented Canada at the International Conference on Governance for sustainable growth and equity held at the United Nations headquarters in New York July 28 to July 30 , 1997 .

petitions
taxation
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have two petitions to present today .
the first petition concerns the family .
the petitioners would like to bring to the attention of the House that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its value to our society .
they also point out that the Income Tax Act does not take into account the real cost of raising children .
the petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to pursue tax initiatives to assist families who choose to provide care in the home for preschool children .
alcohol CONSUMPTION
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the second petition concerns the issue of alcohol consumption and misuse .
the petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to require health warning labels to be placed on the containers of all alcoholic beverages .
marriage
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have several petitions which I wish to present to the House .
the first petition totals 12 pages and contains over 300 names .
it has to do with the definition of marriage .
it calls upon Parliament not to change the definition of marriage in future legislation .
age OF CONSENT
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the second petition is 23 pages in length and comes from the lower mainland .
it deals with the age of consent .
the petitioners ask that Parliament raise the age of consent from 14 years of age to 16 .
health
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the next petition is made up of 403 pages and contains some 9,000 signatures from people in British Columbia .
the petitioners ask that the government stop giving herbal , alternative medicine people a hard time .
they ask that they be allowed to do their work .
i agree with these petitioners and it is a pleasure to present these petitions on their behalf .
the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to present a petition signed by Calgary residents regarding the upcoming Kyoto conference on greenhouse gas emissions .
a local newspaper gathered 6,500 signatures from people who reject any tax that will drastically affect Alberta ' s energy industry .
the petition which I am now presenting exhibits similar concerns .
it calls for a further review of this issue so that effective solutions and a better definition of cost obligations might be accomplished .
the petition urges the government not to sign any agreement until these concerns are addressed .
east TIMOR
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have a petition containing 350 names from Quadra Island and the nearby area in my riding .
the petition states that despite the UN resolutions affirming the rights of the East Timorese people to self - determination , the Indonesian military has continued to occupy East Timor , inflicted violence and caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of East Timorese .
the petitioners ask that the government support a UN referendum for an independent East Timor , impose a ban on the sale of military equipment to Indonesia and end all government funding for the promotion of trade with Indonesia as long as it continues to illegally occupy East Timor .
YUKON WEATHER STATION
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have two petitions to present to the House .
the first petition is from residents of the Yukon territory .
our weather station , the only weather station in all of northern Canada , has been operating for 50 years and is being closed .
the weather station is essential for extreme weather warnings , which we need from November through March , for flood warnings and for fire warnings .
unfortunately , because the minister deemed it not necessary , it is being closed .
the citizens of the Yukon are protesting that decision .
justice
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) :
the other petition has over 1,300 names on it and it is from the people from Alberta as well as the Yukon .
we are asking for the abolition of the use of provocation as a defence .
the history comes from the middle ages , where men of equal class were allowed to challenge each other to a duel and use provocation as an excuse .
it in no way fits in our society today and it is unfairly and disproportionately used to defend in spousal homicide .
i present this petition on behalf of the residents of the Yukon and Alberta .
retirement SYSTEM
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 I am pleased and proud to present a petition on behalf of my constituents in Winnipeg North Centre and on behalf of other concerned Manitobans .
they petition this government with their concerns regarding current and proposed changes to Canada ' s retirement system .
they also petition that this government call for and put in place a national review of the retirement income system in Canada in order to ensure the adequacy of Canada ' s retirement system today and tomorrow .

the Chair will remind the House of each pattern at the time of voting .
i shall now propose Motion No. 1 to the House .
motions IN AMENDMENT
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , there have been consultations among all parties and I believe you will find unanimous consent for an order of the House that would deem all amendments that have been found in order to have been read by the Chair and to have been duly moved and seconded and to further provide that , when there is no further debate , the amendments will be deemed to have been put and a recorded division requested .
the Deputy Speaker :
does the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader have the consent of the House to introduce the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Deputy Speaker :
the House has heard the terms of the motion .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
( motion agreed to )
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am seeking unanimous consent from the House to replace Motion No. 5 on the notice paper with a revised version .
this motion as it appears on the notice paper is incorrect as a result of a typographical error .
the other parties have been consulted and I believe the Chair will find unanimous consent to replace this motion with the correct version .
the Deputy Speaker :
the House has heard the proposal of the hon. member for Prince George - Peace River .
does the House give its consent to the substitution of the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Deputy Speaker :
i assume the hon. member will be handing a signed proposal to the Table without it having been read at this time to the House .
is that agreed ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Deputy Speaker :
might I also ask , since the parliamentary secretary ' s motion appears to cover all motions placed on the notice paper , if it now covers the amended motion submitted by the hon. member for Prince George - Peace River .
is that also agreed ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
motion No. 1
that Bill C - 4 be amended by adding before line 4 on page 1 the following :
whereas agriculture is a basic foundation stone of the Canadian economy ; and
whereas interprovincial and export trade in grain produced in Canada is an essential element of the agricultural sector of the economy , and
whereas it is necessary to establish an organization to coordinate such trade ; and
whereas such an organization will have a very significant effect on the producers of grain and must therefore have the securing of the best financial return to them as its object and first priority and must be accountable to them for its performance .
therefore Her Majesty , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada , enacts as follows : "
i am very disappointed with the unilateral decision to have procedural clerks drafting my amendments to government bills .
lawyers draft the government bills and amendments , and members of the House deserve no less .
thank you , Mr. Speaker , for defending my rights and privileges and providing the independent confidential legal advice and services I need to do my job as a legislator in the House .
it is a fundamental privilege of the House to decide on the rules of the House .
so far we have been denied the opportunity to debate and vote on the quality and availability of essential legal services for MPs to do their jobs .
we represent a substantial number of people .
the amendments we make are very important and deserve the proper consideration and advice .
on behalf of my constituents I thank you , Mr. Speaker , for your personal intervention in this instance .
it has made it possible for me to better represent the interests of my constituents in the House .
i also express my objection to the referring of bills to committee before second reading .
it was my experience that the Liberal majority on the agriculture committee was no more open to amendments than any Liberal dominated committee reviewing a bill after second reading .
that is a very serious concern because we need that input .
unless the government allows for proper critique of its legislation we are wasting our time in the House .
i hope that will change .
the government has subverted the original intent of referring a bill to committee before approval in principle and is now using this procedure to skip second reading debate and deny members an opportunity to represent their constituents in the House .
the procedure was supposed to open up the democratic process , not shut it down more than it already has .
i have introduced seven amendments to effectively address the deficiencies in the bill .
with these amendments I proposed the following improvements to the Canadian Wheat Board Act .
i will briefly go through them and hope to have an opportunity at a later time to talk to each one .
in addition to this opting out clause my amendment would provide producers with the opportunity to opt back in by giving the board two years notice .
finally I put forth an amendment to introduce a five year sunset clause which would repeal the act if it does not achieve its stated objective of securing the best financial return to producers .
talking about sunset clauses , that should be in all legislation .
if the legislation does not meet its stated objective we should scrap it .
i would also like to speak to the four main proposals put forward in the amendments : adding the preamble , making the first priority of the Canadian Wheat Board Act to secure the best financial return for producers , to provide opting out and opting back in provisions , and to provide a sunset clause .
i hope to speak to each of my amendments as they appear in the appropriate grouping of amendments .
first I will speak to the preamble .
i introduced Motion No. 1 to correct a serious oversight .
the Canadian Wheat Board Act does not have a preamble .
if any act of parliament needs a preamble it is this one .
for far too long the government has been saying what the Canadian Wheat Board is supposed to be doing but has done a pretty good job of keeping the real facts a secret .
the board says one thing and thousands of farmers disagree .
surely the government cannot disagree with the preamble I have introduced in the House today .
if it does , I would like on record the points it disagrees with and the points it would like to see amended .
that should be obvious .
agriculture is the basic foundation stone for the Canadian economy .
interprovincial and export trade of grain is an essential element of our agricultural economy .
i do not think anyone can disagree with that , so I hope it will be approved .
it is necessary to organize and co - ordinate such trade .
whoever co - ordinates this trade must have as a first priority the goal of securing the best financial return for producers .
who in the House can argue against that objective ?
the minister responsible for the wheat board even said so in the House on October 28 , 1997 .
i quote what the minister said .
the Canadian Wheat Board in every market in the world extracts the very best price it possibly can get for the farmers of Canada .
if that is the case we should put it in writing .
the board must be accountable to producers for its performance and we should be willing to say that .
these are far more than just motherhood statements .
they set the framework around which the act and the bill must be debated .
for the government to pass an act of such importance as giving a government monopoly powers is asking for those powers to be abused .
i respectfully request that all members of the House support the inclusion of a preamble to the Canadian Wheat Board Act .
it is a serious oversight not to have it in there .
this is the preamble that should be included :
whereas agriculture is a basic foundation stone of the Canadian economy ; and
whereas interprovincial and export trade in grain produced in Canada is an essential element of the agricultural sector of the economy , and
whereas it is necessary to establish an organization to co - ordinate such trade ; and
whereas such an organization will have a very significant effect on the producers of grain and must therefore have the securing of the best financial return to them as its object and first priority and must be accountable to them for its performance .
the purpose of the amendments I have put forward is to protect all farmers .
the government always says that it is listening to the majority of farmers .
a significant number of producers are represented by people on this side of the House .
i appeal to the government to listen to the amendments we are making .
they are common sense reasonable amendments and they should be considered .
the attitude has been " Why should we provide proper legislative counsel to the opposition ?
the government will not listen to our amendments anyway '' .
they are asking why they should provide resources .
that attitude has to change .
what we do in the House is fundamental to preparing legislation all Canadians have to live with .
we need the best resources and the best legal advice to make legislation what it should be .
therefore we appeal to the government to give us the resources and to consider the amendments we put forward .
they are reasonable amendments that address the concerns of the people we represent .
Mr. Gerry Byrne ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a privilege to respond to the motion put forward by the hon. member for Yorkton - Melville .
this is a very substantial piece of legislation , very important to all Canadian grain producers .
it is an important aspect of the governance of that industry .
that is why I am very proud to support the legislation .
in speaking to Bill C - 4 it certainly accomplishes the objectives set out by the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board .
the member for Yorkton - Melville criticized the government for its decision to refer the legislation to committee before second reading .
i simply point out to the hon. member and to all members present that it is a very unique and important method of actually getting input from members .
once adopted at second reading the spirit of the legislation cannot be changed by the House .
in criticizing this method of referring the legislation to committee before second reading the member has criticized the fact that he now has the opportunity to put forth his amendment .
amending the preamble to any legislation would not be in order after second reading .
by actually referring the legislation to committee before second reading the hon. member has the opportunity to put forward his motion to amend .
the hon. member ' s motion is to provide a change to the preamble of the bill .
that is basically what we are here to discuss .
the hon. member is providing an amendment to the enactment section of the bill .
what must be pointed out is that the original bill , as proposed by the government and approved by committee , provides substantial opportunity for the governance of the Canadian Wheat Board by the producers themselves .
two - thirds of the board of directors would be put in place by the producers and not by the government .
that is the form of governance I think the democratic process should take .
that is the form of governance I think the farmers want and that is exactly what we heard in committee .
they wanted a stronger role for producers , and clearly two - thirds of majority control of the board of directors for the Canadian Wheat Board accomplishes that objective .
the purpose , if I were to anticipate for the member ' s motion here , would be to add the preamble , to put specific restrictions on the board of directors so that it would be somewhat encumbered in its job and subject to what many would consider to be frivolous lawsuits in the performance of its duties .
the preamble , as put forward , in essence accomplishes exactly what the bill already accomplishes , with one critical difference .
it provides specific language , which I am sure opponents to the Canadian Wheat Board would enjoy the opportunity to capitalize on and to create quite a feeding frenzy by the legal community whose members of certain jurisdictions would so aptly want to support as opposed to supporting farmers .
i will rise not in support of this amendment to put a preamble into the bill for the simple reason that I am extremely confident that the bill itself accomplishes the goal of providing the producers the opportunity through the process of annual meetings , through the process of disclosure , through the process of producers themselves maintaining their own majority control over the processes of the Canadian Wheat Board .
we are accomplishing exactly what producers want us to accomplish .
they are the ones who are most capable with a majority position , a clear two - thirds , 10 out of 15 , to guide the report into the future .
i have no hesitation whatsoever in speaking favourably to Bill C - 4 in its original intent as passed by the committee of all parliamentarians .
it is a very good one .
when we get into these discussions about democracy and about freedom of members to be able to practice their craft in the House of Commons , something that I would simply remind the hon. members opposite of is this .
what we are really seeing here is that members opposite are criticizing the fact that they had the opportunity to participate in the process .
they are also criticizing the producers ' opportunity to participate in the process .
they want to stifle the ability of the producers who will be sitting on that board of the Canadian Wheat Board .
they want to stifle that opportunity for those producers to be able to do their job in the best interest of farmers .
therefore I do not support the amendment .
i suggest to the members opposite that what they really should be focusing on here is to let farmers , the ten members , the majority of members who will be sitting on that board , do their job and let them provide the Canadian Wheat Board with the leadership in concert with the Government of Canada , in concert with all the people of Canada , the best options for all farmers .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
the Deputy Speaker :
i am sure the hon. member would like to do that , but under the rules of the House , as he knows , on debate on report stage amendments , each member has one 10 minute intervention .
the hon. member will get an opportunity , I am sure , on the next group when we get to it .
he could expose whatever disagreement he has with whichever hon. member who has made comments by that time .
by then there may be several .
he will have a field day in his next 10 minute intervention , I am sure .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is with great pleasure that I speak this afternoon to Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts .
the Liberal government headed by the Prime Minister , the member for Saint - Maurice , thought that a slight revamping of the more than 60 - year - old Canadian Wheat Board , a body viewed with very mixed feelings by grain producers themselves , it might be added , would be a good idea .
discontent in the three western provinces and in the Peace River area was such that producers were on the verge of signing a general petition calling for nothing less than the total abolition of the board .
so , 18 months ago , the minister responsible for the board , a western minister of course , tabled amendments in the form of Bill C - 72 .
we in this House devoted much effort to improving this bill .
but because of this government ' s lack of foresight , we are now , to all intents and purposes , back at square one with Bill C - 4 .
my colleague in the Reform Party , the member for Yorkton - Melville , is suggesting a preamble to Bill C - 4 that I feel I must approve .
i will tell you why .
the interesting thing is that this organization , the Canadian Wheat Board , has an important effect on grain producers and must , accordingly , have as its object and first priority the securing of the very best financial return for them .
the Canadian Wheat Board will have to be accountable to the grain producers for its performance .
Mr. Speaker , can you look me in the eye and say that you object to the Canadian Wheat Board making every effort to obtain the best prices for our grain producers ?
the Liberal government objects to having this in a preamble to the bill .
it makes no bloody sense .
worse yet , they are going to ask the Canadian Wheat Board to account to grain producers for its actions .
the minister responsible is objecting .
i fail to see why .
bill C - 4 does have good intentions .
for instance , there is at least some attempt to democratize the administration of the Canadian Wheat Board , by having 10 - not enough in my opinion , but at least this is a first step in the right direction - of the 15 directors elected by universal suffrage by the grain producers .
that is a step forward .
in case it has been forgotten , there used to be five commissioners , and all five were appointed by the governor in council .
these were generally five patronage appointments , not necessarily five truly competent administrators .
when the colour of the government in power was blue , Conservatives were appointed .
now , since it is red , we have just had the announcement of a series of Department of Agriculture appointments , and they are all Liberals .
one was a bag man , one the chief organizer , one had worked hard to get his boss , the Prime Minister , elected as leader of his party .
you will recall this , Mr. Speaker , since you supported him too and got a little reward for it , since you are now seated in the chair .
bill C - 4 is an attempt to change the Canadian Wheat Board Act for the better - at least I hope it is for the better , and the government is sincere - for the benefit of grain producers .
so why fear it ?
is it a crime to tie their hands and require them to obtain a better price ?
i do not think so .
given that the board will be dealing with $ 6 billion or $ 7 billion , even a fraction of 1 % will mean a better price .
i invite my colleagues in the government to have another look at the proposed preamble .
it is not because it was introduced by the Bloc Quebecois that it is no good .
it looks like the Liberals think that if it is not their idea it is not good .
i do not want to have to reread the main part of this preamble , but the part that interests me , once again , is the part that would oblige the Canadian Wheat Board to obtain the best possible return on grain .
the board should also be accountable for its performance .
so , a vote against this motion , the first on Bill C - 4 , indicates a lack of transparency and a fear of working effectively for western grain producers .
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I too am very pleased to be taking part in this historic debate on Bill C - 4 , the amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act , this afternoon .
before I talk about the preamble before us , Motion No. 1 , I will respond to the comments made by the parliamentary secretary about how privileged members who serve on the committee should feel for the ability to come to the House and propose amendments since the bill was referred to committee prior to second reading .
i would take more comfort in that if I had not felt as a member of the standing committee that there was a rush to judgment throughout the entire process .
i do not recall specifically how many groups appeared before the committee , but they were grouped in threes and fours so that we could get through the bill in a matter of two or three weeks .
the amendments were rushed through in one session .
it was not a very effective way to consider a bill of this magnitude which will have a long lasting impact on Canadian grain producers .
with respect to the preamble put forward by the hon. member for Yorkton - Melville , he said that it is not motherhood .
i think that there is a lot of mom and apple pie in it .
however , I also think that there is nothing wrong with us saying that in a preamble , as my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois articulated a few moments ago .
the New Democratic Party and the CCF before it have always been very strong supporters of the Canadian Wheat Board and we continue to be strong supporters of it .
what is wrong with insisting that there be a preamble that makes it very clear ?
the motion which is before us does that .
it states what the vision and mission of the Canadian Wheat Board is to be .
those vision and mission statements are very much in vogue these days .
we see corporations and other groups doing it .
what is wrong with such a statement being in the preamble about what it is that the Canadian Wheat Board is all about ?
it is a reference point that producers and others can look to when seeking guidance or when they have concerns .
having said that , New Democrats believe that the wheat board has been a very good marketer for Canadian grain producers over the years .
we see absolutely nothing illogical about having this as the preamble and we will be supporting this particular motion when it comes to a vote .
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am somewhat reluctant to speak on this piece of legislation which has gone through committee and returned to the floor of the House .
the reason I am reluctant is because we have been talking about participation in the process , as the hon. member from the governing benches indicated .
quite frankly , I am disappointed in the opportunity we were given to participate in the process .
i am sure most Canadians recognize that this is probably the most important piece of legislation which will affect the western Canadian producer in this session of Parliament .
the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board had an opportunity to put forward legislation which in fact would take the producers of western Canada into the 21 st century , taking into consideration the open global marketplace that we have today .
he certainly had an opportunity to put into place legislation which would allow producers in western Canada to take full advantage of the produce they are producing currently at world prices .
the minister said that he was going to listen to all of those people who were prepared to appear before the committee .
he wanted to hear their comments .
he wanted to make sure their comments were embodied in this legislation .
quite frankly , the process that we went through in committee was , in my estimation , a railroad job .
the legislation was put through committee in record time .
we were not allowed to listen to all of the opinions of all of the people who wanted to come forward .
i will give the House two examples .
in committee I put forward an amendment to bring the minister back to the committee .
the minister said , in his own words , that he wanted to come back to the committee after we had heard the witnesses to be able to hear what positions were being taken by those individuals .
i asked the committee to extend the period of time that it was sitting to invite the minister back and I was turned down on that request .
the minister I believe would have come back but the committee did not want to waste the time to hear all of those comments .
i also suggested that there is a parallel organization called the Ontario Wheat Board which has a fully elected board of directors , which has certain freedoms for its own producers that are not allowed in this particular piece of legislation .
i would have liked to have heard from those individuals .
the Liberal members of the government in committee would not allow us to subpoena or bring those people before the committee to hear how they operate .
as I said earlier , there was obviously an opportunity for the legislation to do what it should have done for the next numbers of years on behalf of our producers .
i come from an area which is referred to as the wheat city .
this legislation is very important .
no one , I do not believe , really wanted to get rid of the Canadian Wheat Board .
all we wanted to do in this legislation was to make sure that it is more competitive in today ' s market and today ' s world .
as for this preamble , this amendment that is before us , Motion No. 1 , I cannot see why any member of this House , including the government , would not support it .
as the parliamentary secretary indicated , the government wishes to have the producers in charge of their own marketing corporation .
all this preamble says is that the corporation will be working for the producers .
why not put that in the legislation so that it is there and people and the corporation recognize it is for the producers and not for the Government of Canada , not for the Minister of Agriculture , nor for the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board ?
my party will be supporting Motion No. 1 .
i would also like to say that the government takes great pride in saying that this new legislation will make the Canadian Wheat Board accountable to producers , will make it transparent and certainly will make it accountable .
quite frankly , the only way it will be accountable is if it has the full board of directors elected by the producers themselves and not have five of those directors appointed by the federal government .
there is another serious concern and that will be spoken to later in the amendments with respect to the appointment of the chief executive officer , the president .
this will take many hours of debate to make sure that the government recognizes that an appointed CEO is just simply another arm of the federal government and not accountable to the producers themselves .
i cannot see why government would not allow this to happen .
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , as with the hon. member from the fifth party who just spoke , I am almost reluctant to speak to this bill in light of what has transpired over the previous month .
as the hon. member articulated , this bill has been rushed through from beginning to end .
for the government to try to pretend to the viewing public , to the Canadian people and in particular to western Canadian farmers that it has used this process to bypass second reading and to hustle this bill off to committee , and it has used this process in order to try to better the bill , is an absolute fallacy .
it is totally ridiculous when people take the time to view what has really transpired over the last while .
the way these amendments have been grouped is very odd .
at some point in time I would like to have it explained to me how they came to be grouped the way they are .
it is hard to rationalize how they have placed some 48 amendments into the various seven groupings .
motion No. 1 , which is the preamble , totally comprises Group No. 1 and was put forward by my hon. colleague from Yorkton - Melville .
part of the motion states :
whereas such an organization will have a very significant effect on the producers of grain and must therefore have the securing of the best financial return to them as its object and first priority and must be accountable to them for its performance .
that is the key part of the preamble put forward by my hon. colleague for Yorkton - Melville .
it sets the tone for the entire bill .
i am very pleased on behalf of the hon. member for Yorkton - Melville to note that we have support for his Motion No. 1 from the other three opposition parties .
that is important .
the public recognizes that it is sometimes very difficult to get unanimous support from all four opposition parties in this place .
all parties view this as a very important preamble .
although some on the government side would say it is just motherhood and apple pie , it does set the tone for the entire bill .
i will read a letter into the record that came to me from the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association that was sent to the hon. Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board .
this letter indicates the level of dissatisfaction with this bill that exists within the farming community : " I append a copy of a news clipping listing the organizations which support the inclusion clause in Bill C - 4 .
they are : the National Farmers Union , Family Farm Foundation , Catholic Rural Life Ministry , Concerned Farmers for Saving the Wheat Board and ` several ' Saskatchewan Wheat Pool delegates of which there are 123 in total '' .
it goes on to say : " The coalition against C - 4 has the following membership : the Canadian Canola Growers Association , Manitoba Canola Growers Association , Flax Growers of Western Canada , Oat Producers Association of Alberta , Alberta Winter Wheat Producers Commission , Western Barley Growers Association , Canadian Federation of Independent Business , Saskatchewan Canola Growers Association , Alberta Canola Producers Commission , Canadian Oilseed Processors Association , Winnipeg Commodity Exchange , Western Canadian Wheat Growers Associations '' .
then it poses the interesting question to the minister : which of these groupings do you feel better represents the interests of western Canadian farmers ?
if you believe - and it is hard for me to think otherwise - that the second group better represents the views of farmers , could you please explain to me why , against the opposition of these groups , Bill C - 4 still contains the inclusion clause ? "
the letter is signed by Mr. Larry Maguire , President of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association .
it is interesting to note that Mr. Maguire did not write the letter on behalf of one organization that the government would care to discount by saying that it had always been anti - wheat board and pro - free choice , pro - free marketing .
he wrote it on behalf of a coalition of many groups that represent literally tens of thousands of farmers who are concerned not only about the inclusion clause but about a lot of clauses and the very scope of this legislation .
first let me say at the outset that we will be debating seven groups of amendments and many members I am sure will get up seven times to speak to various facets of the legislation .
we want to see it improved , strengthened and address the real needs of western Canadian grain farmers .
above all , we want the wheat board to be accountable to the farmers .
however , we do not see that in this legislation .
i indicated during my 10 minute intervention before this bill was shunted off to committee that first and foremost we want the Canadian Wheat Board to be made voluntary .
until farmers have the ability to opt in or opt out or market their grain through the board or through the private sector , I do not think farmers will really be supportive of the existence of the Canadian Wheat Board as we know it now .
there were comments made earlier by my colleague from the New Democratic Party about the groups of witnesses .
it really puts pay to the argument by the government that the reason why it superseded second reading and put the bill off to committee was to try to better the bill .
that simply did not happen .
to show how divisive this bill is , it actually accomplished the near impossible .
to show just how divisive it is , imagine the Canadian Wheat Board advisory committee of 11 farmers itself being split and the majority of those producers calling for the complete withdrawal of the legislation .
i want to read an excerpt from the November 6 front page of the Western Producer newspaper quoting the remarks of the chair of the Canadian Wheat Board advisory committee : " Macklin disputed government claims that one of the results of the legislation will be to democratize the wheat board and turn power over to farmers thought the two - thirds of board members they can elect '' .
then there is direct quote : " We think this new structure will be more subject to political manipulation than the old structure '' .
i completely agree with that assessment .
i think this bill is not going to address the needs .
in fact , it is going to continue to sow the seeds of divisiveness in western Canada instead of addressing the real needs out there .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I must oppose this particular amendment to the preamble .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
Mr. Wayne Easter :
i cannot see why the other parties have fell for this line by the Reform Party which is just a strategy that over time , through legal challenges to the board , will in fact undermine the board .
that is the real strategy here .
let us put it on the table and call a spade a spade .
before I go too far with the Reform Party opposite , I do want to correct a matter that my friend , the hon. member for Frontenac , said .
he talked about the commissioners who have been appointed to the wheat board over a number of years .
he was fairly critical of those appointments .
i think the record shows that the appointments by various governments of commissioners to the wheat board over time have been excellent in that the wheat board has always been able to return to producers the maximum that is in the market and most times has outdone the open market .
as far as the motion by the member for Yorkton - Melville , what does the preamble really mean ?
let us be serious on this .
how does it really stand up in law ?
we know in the past , and it is clearly on the record in many places , that the Reform Party has never been a strong supporter of the Canadian Wheat Board .
it gives it lip service but it tries to undermine it at every stead .
i believe it was last year when the barley producers were violating the laws of Canada that some of these members opposite were actually supporting those producers in terms of trucking barley across the United States in a law breaking venture .
maybe , as I said a moment ago , there is a subtle strategy at work here by the Reform Party in which it is trying to use a preamble to the bill to set the stage where the Canadian Wheat Board will be challenged legally time and time again .
look at the amendment .
one usually uses " whereas " at a political convention for resolutions .
let us just take a moment in terms of the preamble and compare it to what has happened in the past with the wheat board .
i turn to the Canadian Wheat Board 1995 - 96 annual report " Marketing for the Future '' .
in a corporate profile this is what it said :
the Canadian Wheat Board ( CWB ) is the marketing agency for western Canadian wheat and barley growers .
the CWB markets these grains in the Canadian market to more than 70 countries around the world with the goal of attaining the best price possible .
that is what it says in its corporate profile now .
it does not need to be said in terms of preamble to the legislation .
annual sales revenue ranges from $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion depending on grain prices and the amount of delivery by farmers .
this makes the Canadian Wheat Board the largest single wheat and barley marketing corporation in the world .
imagine that , marketing on behalf of Canadian producers with that kind of market power and market authority .
in that sense western Canadian farmers are the Canadian Wheat Board ' s only shareholders .
let me again turn to the comments made earlier by friend from Frontenac when he was critical of those wheat board commissioners .
we expect the new board will be able to do similar things .
a performance evaluation , which was also outlined in this wheat board report , indicates how well it has been able to do .
that is why we need this kind of legislation , so that it can continue to do those kinds of things for western grain farmers .
i quote : " A performance evaluation conducted during the 1995 - 96 crop year showed Canada ranks highly with its customers in such areas as quality of product , customer service , technical support and dependability of supply '' .
on the point of the dependability of supply , if we went with some of the resolutions proposed by the Reform , you could not assure yourself , as a marketing agency of supply , because you would never really know what was happening with that supply area .
with the kind of authority we have under the wheat board you can depend on that kind of supply and you can market intelligently , not just boom and bust , as the members opposite are basically saying we should do .
another study study conducted by three economists showed that the Canadian Wheat Board ' s single desk system generates an additional $ 265 million per year in wheat revenue for farmers , thereby enhancing Canada ' s competitiveness .
it also showed the Canadian Wheat Board provides a low cost marketing service to farmers .
this shows what the Canadian Wheat Board has been able to do in the past with appointed commissioners .
this legislation , although giving farmers more say in terms of the management of the Canadian Wheat Board , sets the stage to ensure it has more say and the kind of authority to continue to market in that way into the foreseeable future .
that is remarkable for one of the largest marketers around .
we cannot support this legislation because I think the Reform Party in this preamble is playing games .
i am surprised the NDP and the Bloc and the Tories fell for these kinds of subtleties .
certainly these kinds of decisions are better left to the board of directors to decide what is in the producers ' best interest rather than providing a heyday for lawyers bringing law suits that challenge the Canadian Wheat Board decisions as not being in the producers ' interests .
that is the real game Reformers are playing .
how many lawyers are over there in your camp anyway ?
i thought you were trying to represent producers here , not the legal community ?
that is what I thought but obviously that is what you are up against .
Mr. John Reynolds :
madam Speaker , on a point of order , one of the most elemental rules in this House is that we speak in the third person rather than straight across the floor .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
point well taken .
i remind the member to please address his remarks to the Chair .
Mr. Wayne Easter :
madam Speaker , much more pleasant in any event to address my remarks to the Chair .
in closing I want to say that this piece of legislation is here in the best interests of producers .
we have had the hearings .
i have said three times that this preamble to the legislation is a very subtle way in which the Reform Party is really trying to undermine the real future of the Canadian Wheat Board .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie ( Louis - H 茅 bert , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I will be relatively brief , given that everything is relative in this House .
a number of motions have been tabled during this debate on Bill C - 4 and I do not want to anticipate , but I think the best is yet to come .
beyond party politics , this motion reflects a global view which is , all in all , beneficial to grain producers .
the motion asserts the importance of this legislation and takes us to the heart of the matter .
just looking at the reactions this afternoon , the debate on Bill C - 4 will definitely be lively .
some may feel it is redundant , but it is better to be safe than sorry .
the number of witnesses heard is evidence of the interest in this legislation .
no one in this House is opposed to the Canadian Wheat Board , but the views and the means to achieve our goals are quite different .
i think we all want to see more powers in the hands of grain producers , to make the decision making process more democratic .
and these days , businesses must account for their performance , that is to say , for their management practices .
we want grain producers and the agricultural sector as a whole , which is the cornerstone of all our industries , to be as successful as possible .
in this context , I think that , if they were here today , grain producers and all those who came forward would support this motion because , as it stands , Motion No. 1 makes a lot of sense .
i would not call this a partisan strategy , far from it ; call it an overview of the debate on Bill C - 4 and what is important to us .
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
we are debating a very serious government bill that will affect certain parts of the country , yet the government is not here to listen .
i do not believe we have a quorum .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
we will count the members and let you know .
and the bells having rung :
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
we now have a quorum .
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner ( Portage - Lisgar , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , it is a real pleasure to rise in the House today to speak on a bill that I have looked at thoroughly .
it is appreciated that after 34 years I farmed and had a wheat board permit book , I can finally say something on the issue .
i was enthused when the hon. member for Malpeque started to talk about the benefits of the Canadian Wheat Board .
he must have a relative in Winkler , Manitoba .
during the fair this summer I had an office there and people came to talk to me .
one gentleman came in and asked me to support the wheat board .
he wanted me to make sure the wheat board stayed .
i asked him how much wheat board grain he grew and whether he was a big farmer because I did not know him .
he had a quarter section and a good job at Triple E , a mobile home manufacturer .
he grew a quarter of wheat board grain , mostly feed barley .
i asked him how many bushels he sold to the wheat board and his answer was zero .
he sold no grain to the wheat board .
i then asked why he was concerned about keeping the wheat board .
it was because he raised hogs and wanted to keep cheap feed prices .
the hon. member for Malpeque went from dairy to beef cattle .
i know why he wants to keep the wheat board .
he wants to keep cheap feed prices .
that is the support the wheat board has .
it is amazing to hear him say that the wheat board is the main gatherer of supplies .
it has the supplies it can deliver .
why do we have all our wheat board grain in bins , all the canola , flax and lentils ?
everything is gone .
it has been sold at good prices .
why do we have wheat board grains in the bins ?
there is no money for that .
the member also talked about law breakers .
the member for Malpeque should explain which laws were broken .
all they did was sell their grain for a better price than they could get from the wheat board .
is it criminal to get the best price for their grain ?
i can see why members opposite object to the preamble my hon. colleague from Yorkton - Melville proposed .
they do not want to sell it for the best price .
they are afraid to put that in the preamble because somebody could challenge that statement .
why did parliament originally pass the wheat board act ?
in the 1920 s and the 1930 s it was to provide competition to the grain companies to get a better price for the farmers .
why has a preamble never been included in the wheat board act ?
why is it a sin to put that preamble into an act that is supposed to protect the interests of farmers ?
i would like that explained .
why would we pass legislation in the House that does not identify what it is all about ?
why would we pass legislation if we do not have the guts to include the preamble or to indicate the intent of the bill , what it is supposed to do , and the bylaws in the bill upon which regulations and rules have to be set ?
not everybody is a lawyer .
we do not have any on this side .
the Liberals have lots of them so they should be able to identify the intent of a bill .
if they do not want to identify the intent , why have it ?
it sounds ridiculous to me .
i was impressed by the hon. member from the Bloc .
we have always been classified as separatists ; Reform members are separatists .
we can work together with our Bloc colleagues and identify good and bad legislation .
i appreciate those members in the House who have the guts to say what is right and what is wrong .
why in the world would we pass legislation to divide the country ?
if it is not unifying when Reform and Bloc members agree on a bill , I do not know what is unifying .
what are we to say about that ?
what will hon. members from Ontario answer ?
every member of its wheat board is elected .
why should Manitoba , Alberta and Saskatchewan have partially appointed boards ?
why are Manitoba , Alberta and Saskatchewan different from Ontario ?
why can we not elect all the directors and make them accountable to the farmers ?
that is what should happen .
if they can give me a solitary reason why they should not be elected when Ontario ' s board members are elected , I will agree with them .
as long as it gives different powers and different regulations to different provinces , it only creates separatism and hostility among certain parts of the country .
we have had enough of that .
we have seen for three and a half years in the House the divisiveness that is created when different regions have different powers .
why do we want to create another difference ?
i would like that explained to me .
i cannot see that happening in the bill , the way it is drafted .
i do not know why these people are afraid of identifying the bill for what it is .
if the bill does not give farmers the right to sell their grain for the best price , it is not worth the paper it is written on .
it will do more harm than good .
i would like the House to support amendments such as the one moved by the hon. member for Yorkton - Melville .
he is a member of the opposition who has an interest in farming .
he is located in a central community which benefits from the farmers around it .
he knows what he is talking about .
he is not just talking through his hat .
it has been a pleasure to say a few words .
i am sure I will get another chance when some of the other motions are being debated .
i encourage Liberal members to stay in the House and listen to the debate .
i see they have disappeared again .
it is a shame there are only four or five members on that side of the House when we are debating a bill of this importance .
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
we are debating an important piece of legislation which will affect farmers out west , and again members of the government have not shown up in the House .
i am calling for a quorum .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the hon. member for Okanagan - Shuswap has called for quorum .
and the bells having rung :
Mr. Gerry Byrne ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I would simply like to point out that some disparaging remarks have been cast on members of the House .
i would like to point out that those disparaging remarks , I think , should be retracted given the fact that the Reform Party -
an hon. member :
do you want to debate that ?
Mr. Gerry Byrne : - is in dereliction of their duties for the simple reason that I see a party which has a caucus of over 50 members , but I only see four in front of me .
Mr. Charlie Penson ( Peace River , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to debate this important bill in the House today .
we have seen quite a bit of activity here talking about the low attendance in the House .
i would agree that this is a very important bill for western Canadian farmers and people should be paying attention .
i would like to speak in support of my colleague from Yorkton - Melville and his introduction of a preamble to Bill C - 4 .
the preamble I am interested in is the section where he says :
whereas such an organization will have a very significant effect on the producers of grain and must therefore have the securing of the best financial return to them as its object and first priority and must be accountable to them for its performance .
why would we want such a preamble introduced in the bill ?
i suggest it is because under section 5 of the current bill , there is no accountability to farmers .
we did not have it in Bill C - 72 , it was not in the previous Canadian Wheat Board Act and we do not have it in this bill .
this is an effort to try to bring some accountability by the Canadian Wheat Board to its producers .
in the recent M - Jay Farms case , the Canadian Wheat Board argued forcefully and successfully , I may add , that it is not accountable to farmers .
it has always taken this position in court .
for example , in 1976 the Riske case , it found in favour of the board and not in favour of accountability to farmers .
when the board is talking to farmers , however , it says quite the opposite .
the board should not be allowed to speak from both sides of its mouth on this issue .
since the board is accountable to the minister and not farmers , I wish that the minister would stop letting the board misrepresent this position .
Mr. Hehn , Chief Commissioner of the board has said on many occasions , and I will quote : " We look forward to a strong and successful partnership with farmers of western Canada . "
that is in the Canadian Wheat Board annual report of 1994 - 95 .
" there can be no partnership without accountability . "
i quote the Chief Commissioner of the board : " We are looking for ways to be more accountable to farmers . "
grain Matters , May - June 1996 .
he said this at the very same time that the board was before the courts arguing just the opposite .
in the grain case of the M - Jay Farms the board was arguing that there is no accountability to farmers by the board .
it is only accountable to the ministers , and the courts found exactly that .
had he been totally truthful he would have said : " We are not accountable to farmers and we are in court here today to prove it . "
and that is exactly what happened .
furthermore there is nothing in the amendments to Bill C - 4 that would make the board accountable to farmers .
section 5 says : " The board is incorporated with the object of marketing in an orderly manner interprovincial and export trade grain grown in Canada . "
it says nothing about accountability to farmers .
if I read the findings of the court in the M - Jay case , where it ruled against M - Jay Farms , they said : " But the express purpose of the act as set forward in section 5 is not the maximization of profits for producers , but rather the orderly marketing of grain grown in Canada in interprovincial and export trade . "
essentially quoting section 5 .
they go on in the court case to say " Taken in this view I take it that this statute is responsibility not to any individual producers but rather to the minister under the act '' .
the members on the other side ask us why we are trying to bring accountability into this House , why we would ask for it in the preamble to the act .
nothing has been changed in the act .
section 5 has not been changed and therefore there is no accountability .
an hon. member :
two - thirds of the board are farmers .
Mr. Charlie Penson :
madam Speaker , the member for Malpeque is making some noises from the other side .
he is talking about the structure of the board under this current arrangement , but the board is still accountable to the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board .
two - thirds of the members on the board are elected and one - third are appointed but the chair of that board is appointed by the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board .
this government is totally out of touch with the debate in western Canada concerning what is going on and what farmers want .
farmers want a system in which they have a choice in how they market their grain .
i know a great many farmers who want to keep the Canadian Wheat Board so they can pool their product , accept an average price and use that vehicle .
i also know a great number of farmers who do not want to use that vehicle .
they want a dual system .
they want to be outside of that monopoly .
this bill does not address that at all and I suggest it is doomed for total failure .
there is no accountability in this act .
when my colleague from Yorkton - Melville said that the very least we can do in the preamble to the act is to suggest that we must have accountability to farmers rather than to the minister , we were ridiculed by the other side .
i do not see any move to try to include potatoes under the Canadian Wheat Board Act .
we have a system -
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
the colleague opposite keeps referring to individuals on this side and suggesting to the Canadian people that there are lawyers and only lawyers on this side who are listening to the debate .
i think that is an irrelevant point and he should not be calling attention untruthfully to the composition of the people on this side of the House .
i am not a lawyer .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
that is not a point of order .
resuming debate .
Mr. Charlie Penson :
madam Speaker , I see that the truth hurts .
it is very interesting that the people in the Liberal Party who want to maintain the status quo of the Canadian Wheat Board have even moved beyond the status quo of the Canadian Wheat Board .
they are now trying to have more crops included that farmers are not asking to have included .
those very people are not representing areas that are under the Canadian Wheat Board jurisdiction .
what authority do they have to put a group of farmers in western Canada under a system they do not even have in Ontario , Quebec , Prince Edward Island , any areas where there is agriculture ?
i do not think they should have that moral authority .
when we ask very simply that there should at least be some accountability shown in the preamble to the act as in Motion No. 1 , even there the Liberals do not have enough dignity to say that they respect farmers in western Canada , that they respect that there should be some accountability .
they even want to deny us that .
it is wrong and they will pay the price for it .

request FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE
canada POST
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
as of just after four o ' clock this afternoon Ottawa time , the people of Canada do not have a postal service in this country .
that is causing major economic problems in this country .
i ask the Chair to seek the unanimous consent of this House to move to an emergency debate on this pressing national emergency after the hour of adjournment of regular business this evening .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
there are some procedures to deal with matters of this kind .
however , on the other hand , the hon. member has asked for the unanimous consent of the House .
does he have the unanimous consent of the House ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
some hon. members :
No.
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
there not being unanimous consent , we will be resuming debate after I read this order .
resuming debate .

CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT
the House resumed consideration of Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consquential amendments to others acts , and of Motion No. 1 .
Mr. Ghislain Lebel ( Chambly , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to speak to Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts .
at this point in the proceedings , we are debating the preamble suggested by Reform Party members .
for the party in power , and especially for the member for Malpeque , I would like to read the motion tabled by our friends in the Reform Party .
whereas agriculture is a basic foundation stone of the Canadian economy ; and
whereas interprovincial and export trade in grain produced in Canada is an essential element of the agricultural sector of the economy ; and
whereas it is necessary to establish an organization to coordinate such trade ; and
whereas such an organization will have a very significant effect on the producers of grain and must therefore have the securing of the best financial return to them as its object and first priority and must be accountable to them for its performance ;
therefore Her Majesty , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada , enacts as follows :
i was surprised at the speech by the member for Malpeque , who is opposed to such a preamble .
this is not the first time a preamble has been discussed .
there was talk of a preamble when the notion of distinct society was raised in connection with the Meech Lake accord .
there was a preamble in which Quebec was described as a distinct society .
hon. Lucienne Robillard :
from downtown Montreal .
Mr. Ghislain Lebel :
the funny thing is that the preamble had no significance back then .
now , as the member for Malpeque sees it , the preamble explains everything , is highly significant , and could mislead the courts if they were called upon to interpret it .
just recently , a new proposal was made in western Canada , about the unique character of Quebec , something comparable to the Pacific salmon , and it was said that " maybe that could be added to the preamble if a constitutional amendment is made '' .
others said " No , it would go at the end '' .
regardless of whether it comes before or after , I believe that a preamble has to give a general idea of the legislative text .
of course , the preamble per se is not a section of the act , but a guide .
we know that the members of this new Canadian Wheat Board , or some of them , are MPs who lost their seats in the last election , people who will get their reward from the Prime Minister and the party in power for their contribution to democratic debate on June 2 .
it might not , however , be a bad thing to remind them in a preamble that their primary authority is the farmers , the producers , not the one responsible for appointing them to the board , particularly when an act like this one is intended to last a good length of time , since it is made to be longlasting , hoping that it is the best possible .
if such is the case , if the government passes this legislation to be in effect for a goodly length of time , hoping to apply it for a long time , it is possible that its buddies who are appointed in this first batch to the Canadian Wheat Board could turn up elsewhere , be promoted to something else .
however , its friends or those who could be friends with the others later on have to understand from reading the preamble of the bill governing them that its priority and purpose is to look after the interests of grain producers .
i do not understand why the member for Malpeque always rises here , waving his arms about as if this were a personal issue , as if it were an attack against him personally when we take apart and criticize a bill that he is defending .
i do not know why he does not just use a little common sense .
there must be common sense in Malpeque too .
the hon. member for Malpeque should drop his habit of leaping up and save his strength for other occasions , of which there are many in political life .
it is all very well to say the board will be managed in a way that ensures its cost effectiveness , but who is responsible for ensuring the cost effectiveness of the board ?
is it the appointed head of the wheat board , the person who appointed the directors , friends of his political party ?
or is it the producers , who may be affected by the sometimes irrational decisions and choices made by the administrators of public funds , decisions that are even less rational because they are not accountable to the people , the producers in this case ?
i find the attitude displayed by the member for Malpeque , despite the carryings on of my colleague opposite who is protecting his chum and shares his views on the matter , in so vigorously opposing what we propose to put in the preamble of the bill , is mistaken and leaves that very impression with everyone including the Liberals .
a member rose on a point of order saying he had the impression , from the way things were being dealt with , that the members considered him dishonest .
that does not come from us .
i was seated and had said nothing .
if he thinks he is dishonest , it has a lot more to do with his bill .
the time may have come to focus on the bill and suggest that the hon. member for Malpeque stop challenging virtue and peace , order and good governance .
but let us try to get across to him what is really being asked by our colleagues in the Reform Party , with whom I seldom agree , but agree with this time .
good common sense ideas can spring from anywhere .
i mentioned Malpeque , but they can also spring from western Canada .
i think that they are absolutely right .
without being partisan about this bill , I think it could be a good bill , a bill that does what it is meant to do and a bill that can have a positive effect .
there is no need to get carried away and go on opposing the Reform proposal .
as a former political figure in Quebec , the late Maurice Bellemare , used to say " What matters is not the size of the sledgehammer but the swing you put in the handle '' .
he has put quite a bit of swing in demolishing something that stands to reason and is founded in logic and necessity .
i urge all members of this House , especially those who feel as uneasy about this bill as the hon. member who spoke earlier , who feel attacked even though they are innocent - and they all are - , who feel targeted by the bill and threatened by its consideration , to share their feelings with the hon. member for Malpeque , who will inform his minister , who will in turn inform whomsoever he pleases , as long as the end result is that an interesting bill is brought back to us .
we cannot hope for more than that .
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I was not expecting to take part in the debate because agriculture is an area of great expertise .
i draw your attention to members opposite who have just asked me to sit down .
i apparently in the opinion of some members opposite should not speak because I am not directly involved in agriculture .
one of the reasons I am speaking is that I have sat here for about an hour and a half listening to the debate , especially the comments from the opposite side .
among the things that have been said by those opposite is their suggestion that everyone on this side is a lawyer as if somehow that is something reprehensible and a reason for not commenting on legislation .
at the time that comment was made there were quite a number of Liberal MPs on this side of the House , and I have to say none of them were lawyers including myself .
another thing I found reprehensible in the debate coming from the other side was the suggestion from one member of the Reform Party that because MPs may not be from the west , may not be from the prairies and may not be directly associated with farmers growing wheat , they somehow had no right to participate in a debate on the bill .
it is certainly true that I am from central Ontario -
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
Mr. John Bryden :
Hansard will disclose that this comment was made .
i feel very strongly that it is a privilege to speak in the House , on either side of the House , on the opposition side or on the government side .
we all have a duty to examine legislation whether or not we have special expertise in the area under debate .
the suggestion that only westerners can debate a wheat board bill plays right into the hands of the separatists who would suggest that the only people who can debate the future of Quebec are people who live in Quebec .
i reject that and I think most Canadians reject it .
as I understand it , Motion No. 1 put forward by the official opposition would establish a preamble to the bill .
i have been campaigning on my side of the House to stop government legislatures , bureaucrats , whoever writes the laws , from writing preambles .
preambles are smokescreens .
we have the opposition suggesting that we should pass legislation which carries on a tradition that really got rolling in the 35 th Parliament of smoke and mirrors through preambles .
what does it really mean if there is a preamble which states " whereas agriculture is a basic foundation stone of the Canadian economy ? "
what does that mean ?
what will it do for a judge ?
does it really matter ?
will it affect how the law will be interpreted ?
i suggest not .
it has no force on judges .
my colleagues opposite can check it .
in the legal profession they call it the pious hope clause .
it has no binding implications for what the judge must do .
the judge must read after enacts .
there has been debate about the wording accountable to farmers being in the preamble .
this is where I will have to accuse my colleagues opposite of not wanting to have a rational debate .
the phrase accountable to farmers sounds noble .
i know it will play very well in western Canada , but we are talking about government legislation .
we are talking about setting up a federal government body .
we are not setting up a provincial body .
we are not setting up a farmers union .
we are setting up a body that has to be responsible to the federal minister because there is no other way of doing it .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
Mr. John Bryden :
they protest .
what they are proposing is unions .
that party does not want government in Ottawa .
it does not want government in the provinces .
it wants some sort of people ' s parliament that can only translate into a union .
as usual , the Reform Part is on the same side as the Bloc Quebecois , wishing to dismantle government institutions in favour of regional institutions .
that is an absolute formula for disaster for the country .
thank heavens you were not going away , Madam Speaker ; I was a little worried there .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
Mr. John Bryden :
instead of the smoke and mirrors of a false debate , of a phoney debate about a preamble that has no force or about accountability that cannot exist , we are talking about a government board that has producers on it .
it is accountable in the traditional way that government bodies are accountable .
they are accountable to their elected representatives who are represented in turn by the minister .
he , in his wisdom , has set up a board which does have composition with farmers .
that is the real debate .
if the members of the opposition really want to do something constructive , then by all means they should have a debate that criticizes clauses in the bill .
it is the clauses in the bill that will be ruled on by the courts which actually govern how the bill will operate .
please , a debate about a preamble that everyone knows is meaningless is not really a serious debate at all .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member for Vegreville - Lakeland .
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , you have spoiled my fun .
i was looking forward to correcting you on that .
the name of my constituency changed from Vegreville to Lakeland and I am quite proud and delighted with this change .
i am also delighted that I can be here taking part in a debate on a motion like this regarding a change to the preamble , which was brought forth by the member for Yorkton - Melville .
i believe by bringing this amendment to the legislation before the House , he has initiated some very important debate on an extremely important issue .
we need that and I am proud to be able to represent the farmers of Lakeland constituency and I believe beyond that to some extent on this extremely important issue .
before I get started on my comments , I would just like to make a comment on the comments of the member for Hamilton - Wentworth .
one of the comments he made was that a preamble is needed only if the legislation in unclear .
we have asked for clarification .
we have suggested clarification .
we have put forth perhaps 30 amendments or more to try to clarify this legislation .
had the government done its job and had its members listened to farmers in the process , we would not have to do that .
we would have clear legislation .
unfortunately we do not , therefore we have to debate this preamble .
section 5 says that the wheat board exists for the Government of Canada .
we suggested a change to section 5 so that it would clearly state in that section that the wheat board exists for the benefit of farmers .
this government has entirely refused to accept that change .
i am upset by that .
farmers in my constituency are upset by that and this is a change we have to make to this legislation before it is passed .
we know it will be passed somewhere down the road .
we will do everything we can of course to see to it that this bill does not pass because it is unacceptable .
i hear the member for Malpeque across the floor shouting some comments again .
i want the record to show that it was that same member for Malpeque who refused an emergency debate on ending the postal strike just a few minutes ago in this House .
i think that is intolerable .
we should not have a postal strike in this country , but I digressed .
let the record show that it was the member for Malpeque who in fact refused that this House allow that debate .
back to the group of amendments that we are debating .
what this group of amendments does is state clearly that the wheat board exists to maximize profits to grain farmers in western Canada .
that is what this group of amendments will do and that is important because the current wheat board act does not state that .
in fact , it states clearly that the wheat board exists for the pleasure of the Government of Canada .
i want to talk a little about that because there are some very important points to be made .
we cannot assume that the wheat board will always do what is in the best interests of farmers .
i will go through a bit of history in the little time I have to demonstrate that very clearly .
i will start before the turn of the century .
to market grain for our farmers , we had a series of co - operatives spring up .
the Grain Growers was the first co - operative which became the United Grain Growers down the road with several amalgamations .
the purpose of the growers was to maximize farmers ' profits .
later we had the prairie pools come in , Saskatchewan and Alberta .
the purpose of those organizations was a little different .
it was to maximize profits but also to share profits equally amongst members , to pool , to do what the wheat board now does .
when we look a little farther down , in the late twenties what happened was the prairie pools were getting into trouble with their pooling .
at the same time as holding back grain from market , hoping the prices would rise , the pools also speculated on the Winnipeg commodity exchange .
because of that they got into severe economic difficulty and went to the Government of Canada for a bailout .
the bailout was the first version of the Canadian Wheat Board .
even the first version of the Canadian Wheat Board was not a monopoly .
farmers had a choice , which is exactly what we are calling for .
one of the important cornerstones of the pools was for farmers to have a choice .
there would be no mandatory pooling in any grain or within the members of the co - operative , no mandatory pooling .
that was something carried over to this first wheat board .
it was during the war to help with the war effort .
i think it was somewhat justified although some people including people who became very important members of the Liberal cabinet later , like Mitchell Sharp , said that it was debatable whether the monopoly should have been put in place .
there certainly was debate about that from Mitchell Sharp .
in a book he wrote quite recently he condemned the monopoly of the wheat board staying in place after the war .
he was somewhat less judgmental of the board during the war .
even important Liberals in the not too distant past have opposed this monopoly for the board .
clearly the mandate of the Canadian Wheat Board during the war was not to maximize profits for farmers .
the mandate was to get grain for the war effort at affordable prices .
that was clearly the mandate .
until the end of the war most Canadians , even a lot of farmers , were willing to tolerate that .
that is so true .
after the war the monopoly was maintained for five years .
Canadian farmers lost hundreds of millions of dollars through the maintenance of this monopoly .
they had no choice but to market through the monopoly , and again , it was to help the war effort .
yet the burden was not spread amongst all members .
after the war farmers paid a dear price for the board not having the express goal of maximizing profits .
that was intolerable .
this monopoly was enshrined in the seventies into the wheat board act .
since then we see that there is nothing that states the purpose of the board is to maximize farmers ' profit in the act .
that is why this preamble is so important .
it is not enough .
we need it clearly stated in the wheat board act itself that the reason for the wheat board existing is to maximize profits .
this legislation does nothing to help that situation .
i would like to close on a comment on what the debate is in western Canada .
the debate is not whether we keep the board or not .
a vast majority of Canadian western farmers want the board .
however , they do not want the monopoly .
they want the freedom to choose whether they market through the board or around the board through their grain company or on their own to a customer , whether the customer be in Canada or somewhere else in the world .
that is the debate .
polls have shown that a majority of western Canadian farmers favour giving farmers a choice in marketing grain .
these polls have been tabled at committee and are available .
the proof is there .
what we must do with this legislation is amend it so that farmers have that choice , a choice which I think is given to people in all other businesses , and the ability to choose whether they want to market through this government institution or in some other way .
i am looking forward to the rest of the debate on the amendments to Bill C - 4 .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
he quickly identified that one of the problems in that town was the pool hall .
i remember the song went " We ' ve got trouble right here in River City and it is because of pool , That starts with p and that rhymes with t and that spells trouble '' .
well , Mr. Speaker , we have trouble right here in River City , Ottawa , and the trouble is the power of the government to dictate what Canadians have to do .
i would say it starts with power .
it starts with p that rhymes with t and that spells trouble .
let me enlarge on what I am saying here .
here we have western farmers who have not been given a choice to even express themselves .
we had this phoney ballot over there in the west where instead of giving the farmers an opportunity to check on the ballot a choice which many of them would have chosen , namely a dual marketing system , that was refused to them by these bureaucrats and autocrats here in Ottawa .
shall I call them the dictators here in Ottawa because that is exactly what happened .
instead , now the government is spinning this support for the wheat board as a continuation of the unaccountable , autocratic system that is there and that is not to the benefit of farmers .
we are talking here about group one , the first amendment , the amendment to put in a preamble .
one of those Liberals over there said " Well , the preamble is meaningless '' .
i beg to differ .
whenever a court rules , part of its thinking is how to determine the intention of the legislators .
if we declare what that intention is in the preamble it can have great weight in a court of law .
it must force this .
just as a little aside , something which annoys the dickens out of me is that here we are debating a very important issue and yet the decision on whether or not to vote for this amendment is going to be made by a person who , I venture to guess , will not have heard a word of this debate this afternoon .
that is wrong .
we have lawyers , non - farmers and people from Ontario and the east who are not even covered by the wheat board .
as a matter of fact , I am led to believe that the marketing system of grain in Ontario is by a fully elected board .
if that is good enough for the farmers in Ontario why should we say to the farmers in western Canada " Oh , you don ' t know how to choose your own president of your board .
we had better get the minister to appoint him '' ?
do members know what I think ?
whereas we want to occasionally give these board members some money that is maybe higher than what the poor taxpaying blokes in Saskatchewan and Alberta and Manitoba can afford , they want to give these guys some of the big bucks and the big perks .
let ' s make sure that it is totally hidden and it is not accountable .
they would say whereas we want to do that for our buddies , let ' s make sure the farmers never find out .
that is what their preamble would look like .
no wonder they are against the preamble , because the preamble that is proposed by our member here is one that would hold them fully accountable .
it is a preamble that would say the board exists for the farmers .
they keep saying this board is the best .
let the farmers choose .
i ask you this question , Mr. Speaker .
i believe that you have had some business experience .
i do not know whether you have had any farm experience , but I happen to have .
a farmer can purchase or sell the feed grains outside of the wheat board .
if that wheat board is serving the farmers under conditions like that , then I have a bridge to sell you somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean .
this is absolutely ridiculous .
the wheat board has to have a purpose for being .
why would there be any objection to having a preamble that says in simple terminology this is the purpose for this wheat board ?
why should there be a wheat board without a stated purpose ?
that is really the debate here and I think the reason that the Liberals are opposed to this is they do not want the farmers to have it explicitly given .
the Liberals do not want them to find out the truth about their purpose , motivation and the reason for the existence .
the reason is that farming right now is very competitive .
it is difficult to make a living on the farm these days , and I know of what I speak .
my brother farms on land which I worked on when I was a kid .
he and his boys are farming way more land and they are getting about three or four times the production per acre that we did when I was a youngster .
my brother is having a harder time making ends meet than my dad ever did .
why is that with three or four times the rate of production ?
it is because the farmers do not have the freedom to take what is rightfully their own and sell it where they want to sell it .
if the wheat board is doing its job , the wheat board will get the business .
there is no doubt about it .
if I am a farmer and I have some grain to sell , I am going to look at the different places where I can sell it .
if I get $ 2 a bushel here and $ 3 here and $ 4 here , unless there are some very strange extenuating circumstances , I will pick the one that gives me the best price , the $ 4 per bushel .
let us say that there is a case where the farmer is offered by the wheat board maybe $ 2 a bushel with the hope of a future payment to make up the difference .
that is how it works .
let us say that farmer sees another place where he can get maybe $ 5 a bushel right now , cash .
i challenge the Liberals .
there are two or three of them over there who can think for themselves .
will they have the courage to vote against their party and vote for common sense and say yes , if the farmer wants to have the right to sell his grain outside the wheat board he should have the right to do that ?
that happens to be in my view almost a human right .
whose grain is it ?
who seeded it ?
who prepared the soil ?
who paid the taxes ?
who paid for the fuel ?
who paid for the fertilizer ?
who paid for the tractors and the machinery ?
who worked 18 hours a day ?
who prayed for rain ?
who prayed for the locusts to go away ?
if we can get rid of the Liberals and the locusts , the farmers will have it made .
i really want to appeal very seriously to the members over there .
the people who are making the decision on whether to vote for this are not hearing these arguments .
may they please use their heads .
may they please be independent in their thinking and vote for what is right .
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is the first opportunity I have had to rise in the House to speak .
i cannot think of a better subject to do it on .
it is a subject that I have grown up with all my life and heard about all my life .
before I get into my speech , I would like to thank the people who helped put me here , the people who worked on my campaign and the people who had enough courage to vote for me .
i hope I do not let them down .
it is with a feeling of responsibility that I rise today to address the amendment to the wheat board act , Bill C - 4 , and in particular Motion No. 1 .
this wheat board act historically has been a subject of much discussion in the constituency I represent , the constituency of Lethbridge , and obviously right across the prairies .
quite frankly , it has been a very divisive subject .
it has pit rural neighbour against rural neighbour and region against region .
it has caused a lot of hardship and a lot of hard feelings among the farm families on the prairies , probably more than any other subject .
there are grain farmers on the prairies who want to see the Canadian Wheat Board completely dismantled .
they are fed up with the lack of accountability to the producers .
we seem to be at an impasse here .
the government has taken this bill , it has worked with it and brought it back and it is still not acceptable .
either the government continues to ignore the demands of producers , while many grain farmers are inappropriately fined and jailed , or it takes this sorry excuse of a bill back to the drawing board , makes some serious amendments and starts listening to the full scope of recommendations by producers and even its own Western Grain Marketing Panel .
when this government had the opportunity , why did it not change this tired legislation ?
why did it choose not to ?
why instead did it bring forward a half baked proposal that does not address the critical problems that are facing beleaguered grain farmers today ?
if producers did not support the bill when it was Bill C - 72 during the last Parliament , then they will not support this one .
this government cannot change things just by slapping another number on it .
sadly enough , perhaps this piece of recycled legislation is the best the Liberals can come up with .
in Bill C - 4 the government has failed to prove to producers that it is in the grain marketing business .
that is what this bill should address , maximum returns for the producer .
a previous prime minister even went on record in years past to say " why should we sell this grain ? "
monopolies in other industries are rarely tolerated , so why are grain producers exceptions to the rule ?
thousands of grain farmers have spoken and Bill C - 4 shows that the government is not listening , which perhaps may help to explain why it is rushed through committee .
the government has not shown producers that it will be responsible to them through a completely producer elected board , insisting instead on appointing the key members of that board .
a fully effective board of directors is fully elected board of directors if the voice of farmers is truly to be heard .
subsequently , if the aforementioned amendment were adopted , section 3.02 ( 4 ) would be deleted since it would not be necessary to specify equal powers between elected and non - elected directors .
the government has insinuated all the way through the process , and I heard the minister responsible say this , that the expertise to run this board does not exist among the producers .
they have to have five appointed members because it is such a large business .
i suggest to the government that it look at some of the operations these producers have if it wants to see efficiency in operations .
it could learn something and could maybe incorporate some of those practices into the bill .
just imagine if producers ran their operations like the government does .
we do not hear of too many farmers who are running up huge deficits year after year , all the while adding to a huge debtload .
if only governments were held to the same degree of accountability as producers .
the government has chosen to cherry pick through the recommendations of the Western Grain Marketing Panel , focusing on the recommendations that fit its agenda and ignoring the recommendations that fit the needs of producers .
what happened to all the recommendations that producers and the panel supported ?
why were the requests for marketing offices producers are asking for ignored ?
why is the government so afraid to put some options on the table for producers ?
why did the government not resolve the contentious and divisive issue when it had the chance ?
where is the transparency that producers are demanding ?
the auditor general is still denied access to the wheat board operations .
this in itself is ringing alarm bells with producer groups across the country .
the Canadian Wheat Board does not have to answer to the Access to Information Act .
how can the directors act freely if they are bound by this secrecy ?
why will the Liberal government not come clean ?
what has the government done in Bill C - 4 to address the unbelievable problems in the grain transportation system in this country ?
absolutely nothing .
this government never even bothered to tackle the Canadian Wheat Board ' s role in grain transportation anywhere in Bill C - 4 .
problems and inefficiencies cost grain producers dearly every crop year , year after year .
the nightmare we experienced last year must not become a legacy to the efficiency or the lack thereof in our transportation system .
why is it always the products of hardworking Canadian grain farmers that sit on rail sidings ?
why are the grain cars put on sidings while other products continue to port ?
could it be because neither the rail company nor the wheat board is penalized for late delivery ?
could it be because the penalty goes directly to the producer , becoming just another transportation tax for producers to pay ?
in closing , why when the Liberal government had the chance did it not address these problems ?
why when the Liberal government had the chance , and took the time and went to the considerable effort of setting up a panel to make recommendations in producing the bill , did it not put to rest the suspicions of producers in the divisive aspect of the Canadian Wheat Board ?
the rural families of Canada and the prairies , families on both sides of this issue , deserve far more .
the Deputy Speaker :
it being 5.30 p.m. , the House will now proceed to the consideration of Private Members ' Business as listed on today ' s Order Paper .
private MEMBERS ' BUSINESS
child BENEFIT
Ms. Diane St - Jacques ( Shefford , PC ) moved :
that , in the opinion of this House , the government should review the level at which the child benefit is indexed .
i am now debating this motion as the spokesperson for the Progressive Conservative Party .
i thank the members of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs for recognizing the importance of this issue , which is to help reduce child poverty .
first , let me explain the reasons that led me to table this motion .
we rely on a Canadian way of doing things that promotes economic development and social justice .
we are recognized all over the world as the defenders of tolerance and fairness .
however , there is a fly in the ointment .
among all industrialized countries , we come in second place in terms of the number of children living in poverty , right behind the United States .
the problem is serious .
today , almost 1.5 million children live in poverty .
i urge all hon. members to join the fight against this lack of equity .
at the first ministers conference in June 1996 , child poverty was put on the national agenda as a priority .
almost all premiers in Canada have asked their ministers responsible for social services to co - operate with the federal government on a new integrated child benefit .
the Minister of Human Resources Development recently announced this new benefit , and I congratulate him and his government on this initiative .
a decision has been made to review the benefit and the respective roles of the federal , provincial and territorial governments in child assistance .
the federal government intends to transfer to provincial and territorial governments the responsibility for helping low income working families .
this function was filled by the earned income supplement , a program that will be integrated with the child tax benefit .
we all know it will come into force next July , but nobody really knows what is in it .
it should define the role of the provinces .
how much are they going to spend to alleviate child poverty , and how are they going to spend it ?
this undisclosed agreement is already called the reinvestment framework .
why is it called that ?
because the federal government promised that the provinces would reinvest as much as the federal government , on a proportional basis of course , that is , the $ 6 billion invested by the government and maybe the additional $ 850 million it promised to invest in the next mandate .
the federal government will hand bigger and more equitable cheques to all low income Canadian families .
it has defined its own role more clearly , and we look forward to the reinvestment framework that will define the role of the provinces and territories .
let us just say that this reinvestment framework will be , I hope , of a comprehensive nature because no support measure can in itself solve the problem of poverty .
this is a vast problem that has to be addressed from a comprehensive point of view .
children are poor because their parents are poor .
let us look at the report entitled " Improving Social Security in Canada '' .
it shows how the Canadian family and its needs are changing .
it says , quite rightly , that most social programs were created in the 1950 s and 1960 s , when the typical family included three children and two parents : a father at work and a mother at home .
today , the average family has less than two children , and both parents work .
over the last 20 years , we have seen a steady increase in the number of double income couples , the number of working mothers with young children and the number of single parent families .
young parents are more educated , but they have unstable jobs , often part time , and without fringe benefits in most cases .
in 1990 , the proportion of couples with school age children and with both parents working was 70 % , compared to 30 % in 1950 .
to have a decent standard of living today , families need a double income .
the family is changing , and support measures must change too .
many changes are needed .
we need quality child care .
we need to make support for the care of handicapped children more accessible .
child care services must be flexible to fit work schedules and work locations .
we have just seen how the social fabric of the family is changing , but everything else around the family is changing too .
we must also look at community action programs for children .
we must develop general approaches to problems related to children , prioritize new approaches and consolidate the ones that already exist , such as the community action program for children .
with the breakdown of the social fabric and the solitude felt by many people who live as shut ins in their apartments , not knowing their neighbours , we must rely on community organizations to renew the ties that have been lost and to rebuild our social fabric .
we must help them , and this help is also part of a comprehensive vision .
there are also prenatal nutrition programs , or assistance to native communities , who are living in worrisome conditions , to say the least .
as well , there are parental and maternity benefits .
let us not forget that , of the 15.7 % of children living with a single parent , that parent is their mother in 92.8 % of cases , and that the vast majority of them , approximately 70 % , live in poverty .
the longitudinal survey on children and youth revealed that one child in four is poor in Canada , that the economic disparity between them differs widely from one region of the country to another , that in Newfoundland one child in three lives under these conditions as opposed to one in four or five elsewhere in the country .
it is a sorry state of affairs .
how can these children do well in school ?
how many of them arrive hungry , with no lunch or snack , having left chilly living quarters in clothes as thin as their parents ' wallets ?
how many ?
one and a half million , one child in four .
under such conditions , neither you nor I nor any of my colleagues would do well .
finally , we come back to the improved and expanded federal benefit .
this benefit will mean that many families will have more money to help them make ends meet , and for many of them the benefit will play a vital role .
but even the most generous benefit would not stamp out child poverty , because even in its improved form the benefit will still feel the effects of inflation next year .
i will , if I may , quote the Minister of Human Resources Development , who said recently at a dinner with members of the Laval chamber of commerce that by " putting our fiscal house in order , Canada has regained some leeway and the ability to make choices , important choices for society .
and governing is about making choices '' .
later in his speech he said also " There cannot be any real and strong economic union without having also a collaborative and dynamic social union to support it .
the national child benefit is the latest example of this dynamic relationship between our social values and the concrete initiatives that are taken .
one thing is certain : children who are cold and hungry when they arrive at school are in no condition to learn .
this is unfair .
in Canada , this makes no sense .
children are our future , the future of our society and the future of our economic development '' .
and what he says is true .
the mechanism for the benefit is simple : the government will increase the revenue of low income families .
as for the provinces , since they will have to pay less for social assistance , they will be able to invest again in programs and services .
this is what the minister pointed out when he said " Each province will benefit from greater flexibility .
Quebec ' s flexibility , for example , will increase by $ 150 million a year '' .
but I would also like to point out that the people also need flexibility .
just imagine , if the benefit were indexed to the cost of living , the cost would increase by $ 170 million a year .
that is $ 170 million the government saves each year , but it is also $ 170 million less for the underprivileged every year .
that is because there is no protection for the child benefit .
that is because the benefit is only partially indexed .
let me explain .
children are dependent on what governments decide .
if we are giving them something today , it is because we gave them nothing before .
we are only catching up .
they have to be allowed to keep up with the cost of living .
Canadian families are suffering from declining purchasing power , and the underprivileged have trouble meeting their family obligations .
the child benefit could be an important safeguard against the devastating effects of child poverty , but the value of the benefit has constantly declined over the last decade , because it is only partially indexed to inflation .
we understand that some decisions , such as setting a limit for indexation , were based a a certain context .
when this was adopted in 1985 by the Conservative government of the day , the country was emerging from the economic crisis of 1982 , and needed to tighten up its administration .
we were heading toward a financial dead end .
this was what the right decision had to be .
but , as the Minister of Human Resources has said , public finances have been put on a sounder footing .
now we have to make societal choices .
to govern is to make choices , as the minister has said , but it is also knowing how to adapt .
according to the Canadian council on social development , if we add up all the 1 % and 2 % increases in inflation over recent years , the loss for Canadian families represents 13 % of total benefits .
this now ought to be addressed .
inflation raises the nominal value of family income .
far more families are moving over the income limit every year by receiving the child benefit , even if the real value of their income has not increased .
the cumulative impact is a reduction in the child benefit of some $ 150 to $ 170 million yearly .
as a consequence , an additional investment in the benefit system merely replaces what has been lost in recent years .
in 1996 , the government recognized that the same situation for our seniors ' benefits needed remedying .
i am therefore asking that we do as much for our children .
i would like to conclude by reminding the House that we must tell our children that they are important to us .
we must remind them that the intention in 1989 of eliminating child poverty by the year 2000 still stands .
we must not forget , hon. members of Parliament , that we must be fair in the choices we make in society .
we must not forget that it is the children living in poverty today who will be turning the wheels of the economy tomorrow .
we must not forget to be fair in the way we consider the future .
now that Canada ' s economy seems to be back on track , we must remember that we can now look ahead and put social justice in this country back in balance .
to this end , we must present all of our children and their families with an honest and a realistic schedule for resolving the problem of child poverty .
we must remind federal , provincial and territorial authorities that , if they do not work together in carrying out their responsibilities and their duties toward those who are most disadvantaged , we will not resolve the problem .
i am not really trying to move them along , but for a number of years we have produced endless reports and studies and I think it is high time to show the million and a half children living in poverty that their country is trying to find ways to improve their situation .
let us give them the means we consider necessary to resolve their situation , and later on they will come to recognize our good intentions .
let us try to give our children a healthy space to develop .
a balance between federal , provincial and territorial governments and getting things in hand in the community will lead to the establishment of effective structures that will put an end to the devastating effect of poverty on children .
i call on the members of this House , therefore , in order to eliminate the negative effect of inflation , to review the level at which the child benefit is indexed , as they did with seniors ' benefits .
let us reclaim Canada ' s title of champion of social justice .
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this private member ' s motion which recommends that the government review the level at which the Child Tax Benefit is indexed .
i am unable to support the motion and in the few minutes available to me I would like to explain my reasons .
before I begin I want to emphasize that the government continues to place a very high priority on making assistance available to families with children , particularly those at the low and modest income levels .
let me take a moment to explain how the indexing provisions work with respect to the child tax benefit .
under the Income Tax Act the child tax benefit is partially indexed on an annual basis .
partial indexation of the child tax benefit is consistent with how other elements of the personal tax system are treated .
for example , the basic personal credit , the spousal credit and the tax brackets are all partially indexed .
this is a policy which applies broadly across the tax system .
the Income Tax Act has been amended a number of times to allow for the child tax benefit discretionary increases .
in actual fact the motion before us today should be considered as a proposal to amend the Income Tax Act and move to full indexation of the child tax benefit base and threshold .
as hon. members know the only realistic alternative to discretionary increases is the full indexation of the child tax benefit .
while the government fully supports the broader goal of increasing assistance to families with children , let us not forget that with an inflation rate of 1.6 % per year , restoring full indexation of the child tax benefit would cost the federal government about $ 160 million per year .
in addition , it would be difficult to restore full indexation to some tax parameters and not others .
the federal revenue implications of moving to full indexation of all tax parameters are quite substantial , with a cost of $ 850 million a year .
the cost is cumulative , so it means that it will be $ 850 million in year one , $ 1.7 billion in year two , and so on .
such revenue losses could threaten the government ' s program to restore fiscal balance .
because of these potential fiscal costs the government is unable to support the motion .
however , I assure the House that the government will review the policy of partial indexation once our fiscal position makes it possible to do so .
in the meantime the government is committed to targeting additional assistance to priority areas like families .
in the last two budgets , for example , the government increased by $ 850 million the assistance provided to low income families through the child tax benefit .
since July 1997 over 720,000 low income working families have received increased benefits as a result of restructuring and enriching the working income supplement .
maximum benefits increased from $ 500 per family to $ 605 for the first child , $ 405 for the second child and $ 330 for each additional child .
next July these benefits will be extended to all low income families as part of the joint federal - provincial initiative known as the national child benefit system .
the national child benefit system has three key objectives : to prevent and reduce child poverty , to improve work incentives and to simplify administration .
under the national child benefit system the federal government will assume a larger role in providing basic income support to families with children .
the provinces and territories will make corresponding reductions to the child component of their social assistance payments and reinvest all the savings in complementary programs and other benefits and services for low income families .
for the lowest income families the proposed increases in the child tax benefit represent a 50 % increase in federal benefits .
before closing I remind hon. members the government has promised a further enrichment of child benefits of the same magnitude during its mandate .
as I stated earlier , these actions demonstrate that assistance to families with children , particularly low and modest income families , is and will continue to be a priority of the government .
let me repeat that the government will review the policy of partial indexation once it is fiscally appropriate to do so .
for these reasons I am unable to support the motion before the House .
i encourage all my colleagues to do the same and not support the motion .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
that , in the opinion of the House , the government should review the level at which the child benefit is indexed .
one can question the brevity of this motion , the strength of its wording or the message to be conveyed , but the fact remains that it is interesting to be able to debate this issue .
this is rather ironic .
members will recall that the present partial indexation was introduced by the Tory government of the day .
this partial indexation works as follows .
it was decided that as long as the inflation rate did not reach 3 % , there would be no indexation .
this means that , since 1992 , there has been no indexation whatsoever .
therefore , families have been systematically losing money at a higher rate than the real inflation rate , because if the real inflation rate had been taken into account , the child benefit would have been increased accordingly .
right now , there is no indexation .
for the families involved this represent a shortfall of $ 850 million .
what is even more ironic is that the Liberals have been pursuing the same policy .
but in 1992 , the current Deputy Prime Minister stated " The government talks about this new child benefit program it has come up with , but let us look at this program .
that is what the current Deputy Prime Minister said in February 1992 .
when the Liberals came to power , they picked up where the Conservative government left off .
they chose not to change this situation .
according to the Caledon Institute , which conducts quality social analyses , the child tax benefit is infected by the partial deindexation virus .
it is a losing proposition for all families .
those that were entitled to benefits lose out on full deindexation , but low income families are much harder hit .
in their case , whatever amount is not indexed represents money they cannot depend on for their daily requirements .
this is a correction the Liberals failed to make and should have made when they came to office again in 1993 .
today , they are being reminded of that fact the motion put forward by the Conservative member .
it will also be remembered that , before 1984 , the family policy included family allowance payments , child tax credits and exemptions for dependent children .
in 1984 , some $ 6.7 billion was paid out under this family policy .
with the changes introduced in 1997 , this amount had gone down to $ 5.1 billion , which means a $ 1.6 billion cut in payments made to families over 13 years .
i take this opportunity to remind you of the somewhat prophetic words of Beno 卯 t Tremblay , who said in 1992 - he was the member for Rosemont at the time - that it was tantamount to giving up on having a real family policy .
we are moving away from a family - based policy toward a policy designed to fight poverty , but we are no longer doing so by using an integrated approach that would allow families in Quebec and Canada to enjoy adequate benefits .
Mr. Tremblay said " The perverse effects will be felt gradually '' .
these perverse effects have indeed become reality .
what the Deputy Prime Minister said in 1992 did happen , and now we are facing a situation where , from year to year - because we are not about to see a 3 % rate of inflation in the coming years - the same thing will systematically occur .
this means that , at the rate things are going , the $ 850 million shortfall generated between 1992 and 1997 may well exceed $ 1 billion by the year 2000 .
the hon. member for Shefford is right in saying that the government should review the level at which the child benefit is indexed .
she is right , but I think we should do more than to review the level at which the child benefit is indexed .
but this was not the case .
we have seen inflation rates of 2 . % , 2.5 % and 2.8 % , but it is the general inflation rate that counts .
when we ask why there is an increasing number of poor children , why there is an increasing number of families who cannot make ends meet and why we are in the process of building a split society , the answer I would say is that we have been slowly undermining the middle class by eliminating a benefit that allowed people to have an adequate standard of living and reamin above the poverty line .
therefore , we can say because of all this that we have a policy that discourages families with children , that the family policy has been replaced by the fight against poverty , but this does nothing to further the objective of a true family policy .
the government likes to say that it cares for children and that it wants to fight child poverty , but the $ 850 million that it is promising to invest will only partially remedy the shortfall .
an amount of $ 1.5 billion was mentioned earlier .
so there will still be a lot of room for improvement .
to achieve this , to ensure that the motion by the member for Shefford can be more effective , I will propose an amendment .
i move :
that the motion be amended by deleting all of the words after the word " review " and substituting the following : " the possibility of fully indexing the child benefit . "
so the final version of the motion would read :
that in the opinion of this House , the government should review the level at which child benefit is indexed .
therefore , in this period of prebudgetary consultations , the government will be able to determine the figures and make the assessments necessary to ensure fairness once again , to give our families a chance , and to send the message that we want families to take their rightful place and to have the financial means to provide an adequate education for their children .
i will end with this and I would like to submit my amendment .
the Deputy Speaker :
i believe the amendment is in order .
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy ( Calgary - Nose Hill , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , when there is a debate about the welfare of Canadians , particularly young people , everyone is very interested .
i commend my colleague from Shefford for bringing forward her private member ' s motion which reads :
that , in the opinion of this House , the government should review the level at which the child benefit is indexed .
an amendment has been proposed by the Bloc to bring the level to full indexation .
as we are all aware as Canadians , or at least most of us who have had families , the child benefits payable in Canada have undergone many changes during the past two decades .
the 1985 budget , which is about 12 years ago , subjected the entire child benefit system to partial indexing .
that is what the member for Shefford is suggesting we need to study .
this partial deindexing has now been in place for 12 years .
it really amounts to an automatic annual tax increase .
this is because inflation still erodes the value of the benefit and erodes the value of the threshold at which maximum benefits are paid .
there is a double whammy which increases the tax payable for families with children .
the Liberal government is doing a lot of breast beating about child poverty and how it will attack it .
it is very interesting the government has done nothing about something that has eroded the disposable income in the hands of families who have to look after children .
unbelievable though it might be , the parliamentary secretary just said " We would like to do things like this but we will oppose the motion because there will be a fiscal cost to this '' .
he is really saying " We need the tax bucks , so forget it '' .
this keeps eroding the income of poor families who then produce the poor children the Liberals say they care so much about .
sometimes we do wonder if it is not true that Liberalism simply is saying the right thing but doing nothing .
the partial deindexing of the child benefit like the partial deindexing of the so - called refundable GST credit and the partial deindexing of the personal income tax system is regressive .
we use these buzz words a lot , but it really means that it hits poor people more than it hits higher income people .
this falls most heavily on the working poor , the very ones with the poor children , the child poverty the Liberals have said they will do so much about .
these tax increases are not transparent .
the Liberals can say one thing and do another .
it is very easy for them to hide this tax increase .
although it happens every year the tax increase is never debated in the House and most Canadians do not even realize it is going on .
it is like the bracket creep we keep talking about .
it is the same sort of thing .
one of Canada ' s leading social critics says that this amounts to social policy by stealth .
yet what do we find ?
we find policy after policy after policy , including the current increases in the Canada pension plan premium , which fall most heavily on those least able to pay penalizing the families and the children most in need of the extra dollars the government is sucking out .
this erosion of net family income continues in many ways .
the child benefit is only one example .
it results in higher and higher taxes .
what did the Liberals get elected on ?
they dropped the average Canadian family income by $ 3,000 .
no wonder there is child poverty .
now the Liberals can ride to the rescue and say that they will certainly do something about it .
they caused it , so they should do something about it .
this in spite of the fact that more and more two people in a family are working .
there is less ability for parents to make choices about caring for their own children because they simply need the extra dollars from both of them working .
despite the rising numbers of dual income families , total inflation adjusted after tax incomes have fallen by $ 2,733 per worker since 1984 .
this is simply unacceptable .
it is no wonder families do not have enough money to feed and clothe their kids , to pay the mortgage or the rent , and to make sure that their children have the necessities of life .
it is because the government thinks it is more necessary for the government to have the money than for the children to have it .
this is incredible .
i hope nobody misses this fact .
a family of four at an income level of $ 11,800 has to pay income tax .
under the seniors benefit the government says they do not have to pay tax for a family income of $ 11,000 , but a family of four has to pay tax .
no wonder there are poor children and families in the country .
yet every year the government wants more .
it takes more and more .
i am happy , Mr. Speaker , that you and many other members of the House care about this matter .
the average Canadian family spends more in taxes than on food , clothing and shelter combined .
in 1996 Statistics Canada said the average Canadian family spent $ 21,000 on taxes but only $ 17,000 on food , clothing and shelter .
it has an insatiable appetite for tax dollars .
that is exactly what he is .
one bottle is not enough any more .
it has to be more and more every year .
the Reform Party simply says enough is enough .
when Canadians make money they should be able to keep the amount necessary to feed their children , to clothe their families and to provide them with shelter and the necessities of life .
the government takes a whole chunk of the money Canadians need to look after their families and then says that it is giving some back .
the parliamentary secretary just said they would like to give more if they could afford it .
they will someday but in the meantime they cannot because they have fiscal costs .
it would cost them too much .
they need our money .
we support the motion of this member and hope the House will as well .
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure to take part in this debate on the child benefit .
it is an issue that is very important for children and families in this country .
i would like to congratulate the member for Shefford on her decision to move this motion .
on behalf of all my colleagues in the New Democratic Party , I would like to indicate our support for the motion as amended by the Bloc Quebecois .
this motion is clearly an important one for all of us to be debating in this House .
it calls for a review of the indexing of the child tax benefit .
it is a very important initiative that should be part - and I add , a part - of a number of changes to the child tax benefit and to a whole range of initiatives dealing with children ' s needs and children ' s poverty in this country .
it is clear that the child tax benefit will erode over time if it remains partially indexed .
a portion of its gains will be lost to inflation each year .
the inflation over 3 % formula , in operation for more than a decade , means that the value of child benefit declines in real terms by 3 % each year as well .
as the member for the Reform just mentioned , it is in fact " social policy by stealth '' , as so aptly put by Ken Battle of the Caledon Institute .
as my colleague from the Bloc pointed out , the origin of this problem does rest with the Progressive Conservatives .
let us keep in mind that the Tories introduced this negative feature into federal benefits , into the personal income tax system and the refundable GST credit , and it is the Liberals who have continued this policy .
without a doubt in our mind , this government , the Liberal government today , must move quickly to reindex benefits to inflation to stop this decline .
we must have in this country a comprehensive strategy to reduce child poverty that includes specifically setting targets for reducing unemployment .
how can we have a strategy to reduce child poverty unless we reduce unemployment ?
in fact , no strategy to reduce child poverty can be complete without a real target for reducing unemployment and a will to meet those targets .
there is another element that must be part of any strategy to address child poverty in this country today .
that initiative is something that has been promised so many times over by Progressive Conservatives and Liberals in this country in election after election after election and then put on the back burner .
that must be raised again to the forefront of our political agenda , and that of course is affordable child care .
the child tax benefit is structured to impel low income mothers into the workforce without providing funding for quality child care options .
the federal government should be ashamed of its decision time and time again to keep this issue on the back burner despite clear commitments , especially in the 1993 election , to ensure that this country would have a national child care plan to provide quality , affordable , accessible spaces for families right across this country .
there is no discussion initiated at present by the federal government around this issue at all .
there is no hint of any plans from the Liberal government to strengthen child care as a complement to the child benefit .
how can we address child poverty ?
how can we assist families cope in these very difficult times unless we make very serious inroads in the provision of such a valuable service for this country ?
the statistics speak for themselves .
for all the time the Liberals have been in power and failed to keep their promise on a national child care plan , failed in providing a meaningful social assistance program in this country and failed in so many other respects , in that time 200,000 more children have fallen below the poverty line .
more and more families , especially single parent families headed by women with small children , are struggling on a day to day basis and falling further and further behind .
it is absolutely imperative for this House , for this Parliament to look at the child benefit in a much bigger context .
the $ 600 million in new federal spending announced in the 1997 budget is only a drop in the bucket compared to the billions of dollars the federal government spends on other programs , the additional billions the federal government hands out in tax expenditures and the $ 7 billion Ottawa has cut from federal social transfers to the provinces under the CHST .
the national child benefit , however important , does not really offer any new gains .
it merely substitutes ground already lost .
as a result of a decision in the late 1980 s to partly remove inflation protection from the existing child tax benefit , its value has been eroding by up to $ 150 million a year .
the government ' s announcement of $ 850 million down payment or $ 600 million in the new federal spending will only serve to bring poor families closer to where they were when the Liberals took power in 1993 .
many of the provinces today are pushing for a further commitment of $ 2.5 billion into the fund by the year 2000 .
certainly it is our hope and I hope the hope of many other members in this House that this government , the Liberal government , will move ahead with such a commitment .
without a commitment to a comprehensive anti - poverty agenda , the child benefit is but a band - aid solution that actually acts to depress wages and further marginalize poor people .
children are poor because their parents are poor .
eliminating child and family poverty will require a concerted effort on all our parts .
it will require and demand a comprehensive strategy from the federal Liberal government that would include many essentials , that would include job creation , housing , child care , training and post - secondary education .
we have no hesitation in supporting the motion today , particularly as amended by the Bloc to ensure full indexation of the national child benefit .
however , we want to register our concerns about the absence of a comprehensive strategy from the Liberal government and use this opportunity to call on the government to come forward with a meaningful comprehensive strategy .
we must act now in order to put Canada back on track to meeting the all - party goal , members will remember , introduced in this House in 1989 by the then NDP leader Ed Broadbent , a goal that said we must end child poverty by the year 2000 .
well , we are awfully close to the year 2000 and we have only seen child poverty worsen in this country .
it is getting more serious with each day that passes because of a failure on the part of our national government to take up this issue and put in place a comprehensive strategy that gets at the roots of the problem .
let us use this opportunity today to recommit ourselves to that goal to eliminate child poverty from this country as quickly as we can .
Mr. Alex Shepherd ( Durham , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it gives me great pleasure to debate the motion of the hon. member for Shefford .
i congratulate her for bringing this matter to the House .
it is something we are all concerned about and that is the issue of child poverty .
we talked a lot tonight about the issue of inflation and how we need to adjust child tax credits for that .
i would like to come at this from a different angle .
it was not that long ago that not all of our legislation , through the income tax system , was totally indexed to the rate of inflation .
in fact , we lived in inflationary times .
peoples ' wage agreements and various other aspects of their financial lives were tied to the consumer price index .
i suggest that that creates an inflationary spiral .
in other words , every time the rate of inflation went up , everybody ' s income went up , child tax credits went up , everything else went up and it similarly impacted on inflation .
i cannot help but impress on the member how devastating that inflationary time we lived in not long ago was to low income families .
they are the ones who are less likely to be able to adjust to the dramatic rising costs of living , their rent , food , et cetera .
that is one aspect I want to address on why I oppose the member ' s motion .
i believe that if we move in this specific area of child tax benefits , we will similarly be obligated to do the same thing throughout the whole income tax system .
you cannot very well argue that at one point is a necessity and yet at another point it is not .
if you look at it in broad terms you will also see that this would create over $ 850 million in lost tax revenues .
not only that , it also brings us back into this inflationary economy which will have a tremendous dilatory effect on low income families .
the government is concerned about the issue of child poverty .
we did in fact inject $ 850 million into the envelope of an enhanced child tax benefit system for working income families .
as we speak members of both federal and provincial governments are debating the issue of how to deliver this program within provincial envelopes .
i am happy to see that one of the things our government is insisting on is that there be an accountability package that goes with it .
in other words , it is not simply money locked into an envelope of a benefit package but there is some way as a country we can measure the success of those programs .
in other words , there is some way to measure if child malnutrition has been improved .
these are things that are not so easy to jump up and be in favour of and implement .
they take time and effort and dedication .
i am very pleased to be part of a party and a government dedicated to the issue of child poverty , trying to find ways not only to get money out to those families most in need but also to ensure that money gets to those children to alleviate the very problems that some of the members have brought out here today .
the Deputy Speaker :
order please .
it being 6.30 p.m. , the period set aside for Private Members ' Business has now ended and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper .
when the House resumes consideration of this matter , the hon. member for Durham will have five minutes remaining in his speech .
adjournment PROCEEDINGS
a motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed to have been moved
criminal CODE
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is certainly a pleasure to see you in the chair this evening .
i rise today on a very serious issue dealing with impaired driving in Canada .
last October 24 , I asked the Minister of Justice if she would table rapidly amendments to the Criminal Code dealing with this serious issue .
i also asked her if she would commit to concrete steps on behalf of the government to review the Criminal Code , roadside procedures , and enact a victims bill of rights in unison with an effort to combat drunk driving in Canada .
the minister to date has not committed to either of those requests .
one thing that we have seen in the past is that her predecessor and , I would submit , the current Minister of Justice have given lip service to amendments in this area .
they have often talked of it and they have appeased , I would suggest , to some degree victims rights groups and those concerned with this issue by giving the appearance of wanting to do something about it , seeming very sincere and genuine in their efforts .
however , to date we have not seen anything concrete either by way of a legislative initiative or even the time spent in talking to these groups .
if there is anything that has become clear over the past number of months in this House on the issue of impaired driving it is that the statistics and the effect on the ground that impaired drivers have on the roads and highways throughout the country and on the lives of Canadians are significant .
the statistics are absolutely shocking when one delves into them .
i again suggest that this is a delay because it is very clear that none of these individuals in the Department of Transport or her provincial counterparts can effect an immediate change to the Criminal Code of Canada .
that responsibility lies with the minister herself .
i reiterate today what I have said previously .
in my mind , the Minister of Justice has an opportunity to do something and to do something quickly .
i want to suggest a few things in the time I have .
the statistics I have indicated have been stated time and time again : 4.5 persons killed in Canada every 24 hours , every day of the week , 365 days of the year .
impaired drivers injure or kill over 300 people in Canada every day .
in 1995 alone , 519 people were killed across the country by impaired drivers .
these are shocking statistics .
it is very clear that alcohol significantly increases the risk every time a person gets behind the wheel , regardless of the level of intoxication .
it is time to do something and quickly .
the most effective way to do that is to bring in amendments to the Criminal Code that would strengthen police ability to deal with impaired driving .
nothing has been done to date .
i suggest there are concrete things the government can do today .
as a start it would be to lower the blood alcohol concentration that is criminal in this country , to review the Criminal Code with respect to reasonable and probable grounds required by police officers so that they might investigate crash sites involving death and serious bodily harm .
that evidence of an accident would , in and of itself , be grounds for police officers to make a demand .
if nothing else , this would emphasize the seriousness of the offence .
the creation of these new standards would also go hand in hand with the enactment of a victims bill of rights which would include and enhance greater participation of victims in the criminal trial process .
if the Minister of Justice is committed to this issue and is prepared to do more than just lip service then these issues will be brought up further in the justice committee and will be acted on rather than simply given fair comment and ongoing debate .
this is something the government must take a leadership role in .
the Canadian public has spoken very clearly .
eighty per cent of people in this country want the government to act on these issues .
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I point out to the hon. member that things are not as simple as he puts them .
there has been much discussion in this House on this issue .
despite what the hon. member said , we are on the record as saying this is a serious issue and we are taking it very seriously .
the minister will be taking it up with her provincial counterparts .
i remind the hon. member , as a member of the justice committee , that the justice committee has already stated that we will be dealing with the issue of drinking and driving as well as with the issue of victims rights .
this debate shows that it is obvious that impaired driving is a problem we dearly want to see resolved , whatever our political persuasion .
although members do not all agree on the best solutions to this problem , they all share the same goal , which is to reduce the number of cases of impaired driving .
recent statistics from the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics were released yesterday .
the rate of persons charged with impaired driving in 1996 went down by 7 % from what it was the previous year .
the 1996 rate showed a marked decrease of 47 % compared with the 1986 rate .
that does not mean we are proud of these statistics or that we should all say the problem has been solved , but contrary to the statistics mentioned by the hon. member , these recently released statistics indicate the rate of persons charged with impaired driving has gone down .
for 1996 all the jurisdictions in Canada reported a decrease in the rate of persons charged with impaired driving .
the centre stated that in looking at the adult court survey data included in the Juristat that unlike other offences under the Criminal Code , persons charged with impaired driving are more likely to be found guilty .
the minister is very committed to bringing forth some solutions to this problem .
she will be -

BC MINE
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , on November 4 , I reminded the Minister of Human Resources Development that 300 miners in Black Lake had lost their jobs , that their average age was 52 , that the region is suffering high unemployment , and that these workers were calling for a modified POWA program .
Louise Harel in Quebec is in agreement .
jean Dup 茅 r 茅 , the president of Lab Chrysotile , is in agreement .
only our Minister of Human Resources Development in Ottawa is refusing to budge .
the minister should sit down and take a serious look at the issue of these men from the BC mine in Black Lake .
black Lake is four kilometres from Thetford , and the small a asbestos region is not the same as the large A Asbestos region .
the guys from the BC mine are not workers from British Columbia , as the parliamentary secretary to the Minister for International Cooperation claims .
why does the Minister of Human Resources Development himself not reply to our questions regarding the creation of a modified POWA program for the workers of the BC mine ?
the department is completely adrift .
all the big shots in the Liberal Party are getting involved : the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Cooperation , and tonight , the reply will probably come from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice .
that is why they think the BC Mine workers are from British Columbia and that is also why the minister himself is wrong in portraying the city of Asbestos as the capital of the asbestos industry .
the minister should leave the war veterans aside and take care of the BC Mine veterans .
furthermore , he should address the issue of cooperation between Quebec and Canada instead of letting the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Cooperation stumble in his place .
the people in the Black Lake region would be better served if cabinet knew that Black Lake is not Asbestos and that the BC Mine is in Black Lake and not in British Columbia .
most of these workers are over 50 and they are entitled to a modified POWA because , on March 7 , 1996 , an application to that effect was submitted to the Minister of Human Resources Development ; furthermore , the program must be modified because Jean Dup 茅 r 茅 is ready to make his own contribution to this POWA .
so I am very eager to hear the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice .
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the minister , despite the fact that he is not here , is sensitive , open and always willing to listen to Canadians .
as we have previously indicated , the government recognizes difficulties experienced by Canadians who lose their jobs , particularly those affected by the closing of the mine in Black Lake , in the hon. member ' s riding .
however , this layoff cannot be considered under the program for older workers adjustment .
the POWA ended last March because , among other things , it was not fair and equitable to all older workers in Quebec and Canada .
the program was offered only in some provinces .
the Government of Canada assumed 70 % of the cost and the provinces 30 % . There were so many restrictions to the program that a good number of older workers simply could not qualify .
the government generously offered almost $ 3 million to help the miners at the British Canadian miner re - enter the workforce .
the Department of Human Resources Development went from passive income support to proactive measures in order to help workers re - enter the workforce .
provinces also worked along that line .
the employer has always indicated its willingness to help workers .
the Government of Quebec is prepared to pay its 30 % share of a program which no longer exists because of its inequities .
our government wants to work in co - operation with the company and the province of Quebec for the benefit of Quebec workers .
the Deputy Speaker :
the motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted .
accordingly , this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
( the House adjourned at 6.44 p.m. )

routine PROCEEDINGS
committees OF THE HOUSE
transport
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the first report of the Standing Committee on Transport , on Bill C - 9 , the Canada Marine Act .
* * *
competition ACT
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 20 , an act to amend the Competition Act and to make consequential and related amendments to other acts .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
* * *
small BUSINESS LOANS ACT
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 21 , an act to amend the Small Business Loans Act .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )

anti - PERSONNEL MINES CONVENTION IMPLEMENTATION ACT
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 22 , an act to implement the convention on the prohibition of the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of anti - personnel mines and on their destruction .
( motions deemed adopted , the bill is read the first time and printed )
* * *
canada HEALTH ACT
Mr. Mauril B 茅 langer ( Ottawa - Vanier , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 282 , an act to amend the Canada Health Act ( linguistic duality ) .
the bill would amend the statute so that a province would be paid the full sum under the Canada health and social transfer only if it honoured the principle of Canada ' s linguistic duality .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
* * *
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT
Mr. Speaker , it gives me pleasure to rise in this House and introduce this private members ' bill to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act ( audit ) .
over the years , the auditor general has provided a valuable service to Canadians by pointing out waste in federal government as well as showing where Canadians have received value for their money .
western farmers and Canadians in general have demanded legislation that would make the Canadian Wheat Board more accountable to producers .
this bill endeavours to do exactly that and probably restore the faith of farmers in the Canadian Wheat Board .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed .
* * *
criminal RECORDS ACT
Mr. Speaker , this bill will enable children ' s organizations and parents to access the criminal record of persons convicted of sexual offences against children , even if later the sexual offender has received a pardon .
this limited disclosure will only be allowed to individuals who apply for a position of trust with respect to children .
this bill is in response to a public concern and a large petition that was received and presented in the last Parliament .
it is aimed to better protect our children from potential abuse .
i think it is quite appropriate that it be introduced in the House on this day because it is National Child Day .
( motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed )
* * *
golden ANNIVERSARY
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , there have been consultations among the parties , and I rise to seek the unanimous consent of the House to move the following motion :
that this House , on behalf of all Canadians , convey its warm greetings and best wishes to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh on the happy occasion of their Golden Wedding Anniversary .
the Speaker :
does the hon. member have the consent of the House to put the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Speaker :
the House has heard the terms of the motion .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
No.
the Speaker :
the hon. member asked for unanimous consent and unanimous consent was not granted .
motion negatived
Mr. Jason Kenney :
Mr. Speaker , on a point of order .
the Speaker :
is the point of order on this matter ?
Mr. Jason Kenney :
Mr. Speaker , I received unanimous consent to introduce the motion .
the Speaker :
you are correct .
unanimous consent was given to introduce the motion .
the motion was defeated .
* * *
petitions
national CHILD DAY
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
therefore , the petitioners request Parliament to address their concerns by supporting my Private Members Motion No. 33 which will add protection of parental rights and responsibilities to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
criminal CODE
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
these citizens of Canada support retention of section 43 of the Criminal Code which states : " Every school teacher , parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child who is under his care if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances '' .
the petitioners believe the government is weakening the role of parents in determining what is in the best interests of the child by continuing to fund research and court challenges by people who advocate the removal of section 43 .
so your petitioners request Parliament to affirm the duty of parents to responsibly raise their children according to their own conscience and beliefs and retain section 43 in Canada ' s Criminal Code as it is currently worded .
* * *
questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I ask that all questions be allowed to stand .
the Speaker :
is that agreed ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
* * *
request FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE
canada POST
the Speaker :
i have received a letter from the hon. member for West Kootenay - Okanagan with a request for an emergency debate .
i will permit him a few short sentences to outline what it is all about and we will go from there .
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wish to ask for some guidance .
i understand it is customary that I read the actual application I made to the House for this .
the Speaker :
what is actually needed is a statement of the reason for the request , not necessarily what is in the letter .
i have already read the letter so it is just to give us an idea of what this debate would be all about .
Mr. Jim Gouk :
Mr. Speaker , I seek leave to present a motion under Standing Order 52 ( 1 ) and 52 ( 2 ) for the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that requires the urgent consideration of all hon. members , the current postal situation .
it is appropriate that we examine all the issues that affect every one of the 31 million Canadians in this country .
i am not asking that we specifically debate something like back to work legislation but rather that we should examine the impact and ramifications of this current action , that we examine all the different possibilities in terms of what might be appropriate actions to take to reduce the harmful impact of this and collectively arrive at some decisions as to how we may best serve the interests of all Canadians .
speaker ' S RULING
the Speaker :
we have a general idea of what the hon. member wants in this emergency debate .
at this time it would seem to me that it does not fulfil the requirements for an emergency debate .
perhaps at a later time that would be the case .
on a point of order , the hon. member for Calgary Southeast .
* * *
points OF ORDER
golden ANNIVERSARY
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , moments ago I received unanimous consent to introduce a motion .
the Chair then sought unanimous consent to pass the motion .
i refer the Speaker to section 552 ( 1 ) of Beauchesne ' s :
every matter is determined in the House of Commons upon a question put by the Speaker , on a proposition submitted by a Member , and resolved either in the affirmative or negative as the case may be .
this proposition , called a motion , is a proposal moved by one Member , in accordance with certain well established rules , that the House do something , or order something to be done or express an opinion with regard to some matter .
i therefore put it to you , Mr. Speaker , that a voice vote should have been held on this motion rather than unanimous consent , which was already given in the introduction of the motion and which is not necessary to approve it .
the Speaker :
let me go through the whole thing .
my understanding is that this is what happened .
the hon. member asked " I would like to seek the unanimous consent to move this motion '' .
at that point I asked the House " does the hon. member have unanimous consent to put the motion ? "
at that point I heard no one dissenting .
therefore the hon. member had the right to put the motion .
when the hon. member put the motion I again sought unanimous consent .
there was not unanimous consent at that time .
if anyone dissents then that dies right there .
the hon. member does bring up an interesting point that this is a motion .
at that point , after I had asked whether there was unanimous consent and there was a " no '' , my clerk informs me , and I agree with the rules , I should have put this to a voice vote .
i , as the Speaker , made this error .
what I am going to do now , with the permission of the House , is do it again .
i invite hon. members to take it from there .
i will deal with this the way it should have been dealt with .
the hon. member has sought unanimous consent to put the motion .
is that correct ?
some hon. members :
No.
Mr. Ken Epp :
Mr. Speaker , I believe you have gone back too far , if I may suggest that , because unanimous consent to put the motion was already given by the House .
the part which you have to go back to is the moving of the motion itself .
that is where we were at .
that was where the error occurred .
the Speaker :
i did have unanimous consent to put the motion .
i am proceeding from that point .
some hon. members :
agreed .
some hon. members :
No.
the Speaker :
all those in favour of the motion will please say yea .
some hon. members :
yea .
the Speaker :
all those opposed will please say nay .
some hon. members :
nay .
the Speaker :
in my opinion the yeas have it .
and more than five members having risen :
the Speaker :
call in the members .

the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
i declare the motion carried .
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i wonder about the process here .
we were forced into a situation where we had to hold a standing vote , yet it carried unanimously .
i wonder what precedent has been set today because of the Bloc .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
with respect , the Chair does not believe that is a point of order .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on the same point of order or similar point of order .
obviously there is nothing uncommon about having a unanimous standing vote .
it has happened a number of times .
my point is that , as happy as I and my colleagues are to support the motion of congratulations to the Queen and Prince Phillip on the occasion of their 50 th wedding anniversary , the House to some degree was asked to believe there had been some prior agreement that this would happen at this time .
that simply was not so .
there had been some mention that something like this might happen , but there certainly had been no agreement .
i think it reflects an unfortunate willingness to play politics with something that we should not play politics with .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member ' s intervention has been noted .
the House needs to deal with that which takes place in the House when it takes place .
the matter has been dealt with , in the opinion of the Chair .
we will now proceed to orders of the day .
government ORDERS
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT
the House resumed from November 19 consideration of Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts , as reported ( with amendment ) from the committee ; and of Motion No. 1 .
Mr. David Chatters ( Athabasca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to speak in support of Motion No. 1 moved by my colleague from Yorkton - Melville .
i originally had not intended to intervene in the debate at this point , but after listening yesterday to the debate in the House and to some of the comments on the government side I was motivated to take part in the debate .
i can speak to the issue before us , the Canadian Wheat Board bill , with some authority , being the third generation in my family to be involved in the farming profession .
my family held a wheat board permit probably since the creation of the Canadian Wheat Board and certainly since the creation of the monopoly of the Canadian Wheat Board .
that is an important consideration to note as we take part in the debate because of some of the interventions made by the other side , in particular by the member for Hamilton - Wentworth yesterday , on the credibility and the willingness of members on both sides to speak .
i would like it understood that my constituents and I support the concept of single desk selling for prairie grain farmers .
producers in my constituency feel strongly about that and would wish to support it .
producers in my constituency are simply asking for fairness and equality with grain producers in others parts of Canada .
they are asking for transparency and accountability on the part of the board and an end to the secrecy and the closed situation we have now .
both the interests of my producers in preserving a single desk selling agency and their desire for transparency and accountability could be achieved if the government had chosen to go that route .
we could preserve the Canadian Wheat Board and provide farmers with choices .
if the Canadian Wheat Board were acting in the best interests of producers , producers would use the Canadian Wheat Board .
the problem is that we are setting up a situation that will inevitably destroy the Canadian Wheat Board .
farmers will continue to fight for choices and options .
eventually it will mean the destruction of the wheat board and the loss of the concept of the single desk selling agency .
that would be a real change .
we heard a lot of discussion in the debate yesterday about who the Canadian Wheat Board currently works for and who it will work for under this bill if it goes forward .
it is pretty obvious to all of us grain producers that the Canadian Wheat Board as far back as World War II was not working in the best interest of farmers and some of my colleagues raised that point .
in our contribution to the war effort in western Canada , we probably contributed more through the loss of revenue on grain sales than what the national energy program drew out of western Canada .
there was a tremendous loss in revenue to the western Canadian producer .
yet there does not seem to have been any recognition of that and certainly no recognition here .
there are all kinds of other instances where the Canadian Wheat Board has been used as a foreign policy tool and even a domestic internal policy tool , much to the detriment of the Canadian producer .
i would also like to respond to the comments made by the hon. member for Hamilton - Wentworth yesterday who took great grievance because of his impression that somebody over here said that he had no right to speak on this issue .
as a member of this House , he certainly had every right to speak on this issue , but the question has to be about the credibility of those who are speaking on the issue .
the parliamentary secretary to the agriculture minister is a potato farmer from Prince Edward Island who judiciously guards his right to make choices in the marketing -
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
the member for Athabasca seems to be referring to me .
i am Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and I am a beef and grain producer from Prince Edward Island .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Chair and the House stands corrected .
Mr. David Chatters :
my apologies for that error , Mr. Speaker .
however , I feel quite confident that the member protects his right vigorously to make choices in the way he markets his products .
therefore , I think he lacks some credibility when he tries to impose on western farmers something that he does not wish to have imposed upon himself .
some hon. members :
that ' s right .
an hon. member :
a double standard .
Mr. David Chatters :
of course , if we keep going in that same direction , the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources , I believe from the province of Newfoundland , I doubt has ever sold a bushel of wheat in his life as well .
the minister of agriculture , engaged in the profession of agriculture , enjoys a wheat board fully elected and fully accountable , yet he wishes to impose something different on the farmers of western Canada .
i think it is a question of credibility of those who speak and what they are trying to impose on others that they would not impose on themselves .
i think that is an important point to make .
the Minister of Natural Resources and the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , being from the prairies at least gives him some credibility , but I would question whether the minister has ever sold a bushel of wheat in his life .
i have to perhaps forgive the government a little bit there because truly Liberals on the Canadian prairies are becoming as scarce as prairie chickens on the prairies these days .
i have to understand the limited choice the government had when they chose .
i also want to respond to the comments by the hon. member for Hamilton - Wentworth about the preamble not being important .
as one of my colleagues pointed out , the courts have long been famous for using the preamble to determine the intention of the legislation when they are drafting the bill .
i do not think there is anywhere where that is more apparent than in the courts and the rewriting of the Canadian human rights bill .
certainly an effort to clarify the intention of the legislatures in the preamble would be taken into consideration and an is an extremely important point and not to be ignored .
our intention is not smoke and mirrors .
it is certainly honourable .
i have to also question the effort by the government through this bill to protect from legal action the officers of the Canadian Wheat Board and the secrecy , the lack of accountability through access to information or the auditor general .
i think this effort to protect the officers of the board in good measure is a result of the actions of my colleague from Portage - Lisgar in his efforts to bring some accountability and transparency to the board .
i do not think that there is really support for those kinds of actions .
because of the lack of time , I simply say in conclusion that , in all sincerity , we are not asking for anything in this Wheat Board Act that producers in the rest of Canada do not have already .
in the interest of fairness , I think it would be reasonable to provide some accountability , some transparency to a board that works for the farmers .
Mr. Jerry Pickard ( Kent - Essex , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I find very interesting the position that the Reform Party has taken over whether an elected person from this House can speak about the western grain situation .
i wonder if they would take the very same position if we talked about the auto pact , that no one from the west should be able to speak about the auto pact or no one from the west should be able to talk about other factors that affect this nation .
there is absolutely no question that Ontario produces a tremendous amount of grain .
in my riding I would suggest to you that that grain is produced and the certificates from that grain have to be confirmed by the Canadian Wheat Board .
the Canadian Wheat Board , without question , has a tremendous effect on the grain farmers in Ontario .
the new law now before Parliament is based on many months of consultation with farmers , including public hearings across the prairies .
throughout its history , the Canadian Wheat Board has been governed by a small group of commissioners appointed by the government and legally responsible only to the government .
under the new law , it is the first time the Canadian Wheat Board will be run by a board of directors .
there will be 15 directors in total and two - thirds of them , 10 of the 15 directors , will be directly elected by prairie farmers .
they will take office at the earliest possible date in 1998 once the new law is passed by Parliament .
all the powers of the Canadian Wheat Board will be in the hands of the directors and because two - thirds of them will be elected , they will be directly accountable to producers for how they manage the Canadian Wheat Board ' s business .
in addition to the power to run the affairs of the Canadian Wheat Board , the directors will have specific authority to select their own chairperson ; to set the salaries of directors , the chairperson and president ; to review the performance of the president and to recommend his or her dismissal , if necessary .
to ensure farmers are getting value for their money , the directors will be legally entitled to have full disclosure of all facts and figures by the Canadian Wheat Board operations , including all financial audited statements .
the directors will be able to examine the prices at which grain is sold , the price premiums achieved , all operating costs , and whether the wheat board is truly efficient .
through these elected directors the Canadian Wheat Board will gain practical expertise in the real producers .
if the directors are not satisfied with how the Canadian Wheat Board deals with the farmers or its sales strategy or the way it does business , they can make the necessary changes .
the new law will require the directors and officers of the Canadian Wheat Board to act honestly and in good faith , exercising all reasonable care and diligence .
if they fail their duty , they will be exposed and have legal consequences .
despite the structural changes , the Government of Canada will continue to provide the Canadian Wheat Board with financial guarantees .
they will cover not only the initial payments set at the beginning of each pooling period and the Canadian Wheat Board ' s credit sales program but also all of the general borrowings .
since the Canadian Wheat Board is a multibillion dollar enterprise , the amount outstanding under these guarantees is very large .
for this reason , there is continuing need for the government to have a window on the Canadian Wheat Board in addition to the new accountability directly to farmers .
such a window is also necessary because the Canadian exporter of wheat and barley , whether on the prairies or elsewhere , requires a Canadian Wheat Board export permit .
this safeguarding of public interest will be achieved by the government appointing a minority of directors , five in total .
all of the directors , whether elected , the ten or five who are appointed , will have the same powers , duties and functions .
the farmers will hold two thirds of that majority .
the new law will put farmers in the driver ' s seat when it comes to any future changes in the Canadian Wheat Board .
if farmers want to remove some type of grain from the Canadian Wheat Board ' s current single desk system , that can be done subject to three conditions .
the directors must make it a recommendation , the Canadian Grain Commission must approve an identity preservation system to protect the quality standards and , if proposed exclusion is significant to all the farmers , the farmers must vote for that approval .
if farmers want to add votes , rye , flax , canola to the Canadian Wheat Board ' s existing mandate , that too can be done subject to three conditions .
the farm organization that represents the producers of that commodity must make a written request , the Canadian Wheat Board ' s directors must recommend it and there must be a vote among the farmers to approve it .
these new provisions are balanced and fair in both ways for either exclusions or inclusions .
in either case , the authority is where it belongs , in the hands of themselves .
the Canadian Wheat Board is going to be more flexible .
it will give to farmers more options in how they are paid and how their grain is moved through the system .
it will make cash purchases of wheat and barley , increase initial payments quickly whenever market conditions warrant , close and pay out pool accounts at any time , provide an early pool and cash out option , fully use modern risk management tools , issue negotiable producer certificates , offset producers ' grain storage and / or carrying costs , facilitate deliveries on condos ' storage systems and receive grain through on - farm mobile elevators .
the Canadian Wheat Board is a very effective marketer of Canadian grain .
it has the support of the majority of western farmers .
they want realistic and sensible Canadian Wheat Board changes but they do not want a scenario that would lead inevitably to the board ' s destruction .
just how valuable overall has the scheme of things been ?
it sells some $ 5 billion of grain per year at marketing costs of a few pennies per bushel .
it is one of Canada ' s most significant business enterprises , doing business in more than 70 countries around the world .
it is our fifth largest exporter and our largest net earner for foreign exchange .
it has earned , for itself and Canada , a positive reputation in the eyes of global customers .
it is very important to the Canadian economy .
the board targets to extract maximum premiums but very important , the quality , cleanliness and consistency and our technical support are long - term , dependable , for the customer , the consumer from which we sell grain .
the Canadian Wheat Board has been rated as number one in the world .
these characteristics , coupled with the size of the board , its global reach and the market clout , result in Canada having roughly 20 % of the share of the world market .
the Government of Canada believes that it is worth preserving .
i am very pleased with the principles put forth in the bill .
i am certain it will enhance our grain sales in the future .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i believe I am entitled to have the member table the grain certificates to which he referred in his speech .
i wonder if he could table them so that the House could see how unfair the certificates are .
those provinces can export their grain with these certificates but the other three provinces cannot .
i believe the hon. member should table them immediately .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Chair will consult with the table officers .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
in the opinion of the Chair this is a point of debate , but the Chair will invite the hon. member for Kent - Essex , if he has the papers and wishes to table them , to do so .
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I do not even know where to start .
i am just amazed to hear all these things coming from across the way about the great consultation process that went on .
nobody would deny that .
many MPs from the Toronto region will definitely support the government because they have been told that is what they have to do in this free country led by that outfit .
i invite those Toronto MPs to come to Wild Rose to visit little communities in my area and to talk to farmers .
we should let farmers convince these people how they should vote rather than being told how to vote .
we know that will happen .
we know it will be difficult to defeat a poor piece of legislation such as this one because of the rules of the Liberal Party , the governing body .
those ladies and gentlemen should come out to talk to the farmers .
in every poll we have done in Wild Rose 80 % to 90 % of the people want dual marketing .
they like to go out there to meet with the elite but they do not know anything about farmers .
they should try it some time .
Mr. Speaker , I bet you were a businessman before you came to the House .
i would bet on that .
i bet you were a producer of goods of some sort or that you provided a service .
i bet you did your best to maximize profits in your business .
if you did not then you were doing a poor job .
every manufacturing company or producer in the country tries to find the best place to make the best buck and get the best value for their product .
that is good common sense .
why is it that one segment in one region of the country that is not allowed to do that ?
what kind of situation is that ?
let us take a look at it a little further .
some people in some of these regions -
some hon. members :
stick around .
Mr. Myron Thompson :
all of sudden there are no Liberals in the House at all .
that is too bad .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
with respect , all hon. members are aware that we do not refer to the presence or absence of other hon. members at any specific time .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the appropriate thing would be to call for a quorum .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
we have a quorum call .
and the count having been taken :
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
there is quorum .
Mr. Myron Thompson :
Mr. Speaker , too bad all members of the House are not listening carefully to the debate that is going on here before casting their votes .
instead they are waiting for the whip of a certain party to pull their strings so the little puppets can jump up and vote the way they are told , the way they have done in the House for ages .
it is too bad that happens .
i was talking about maximizing profits , which is what the preamble is all about .
it is only common sense .
anybody with the brain of a fish could say that makes sense .
i went to two court trials in Brandon , Manitoba , and spent some time watching the proceedings .
individuals were brought before the court for having illegally sold their grain across the border without wheat board permits and were charged .
they actually broke the law ; nobody is denying that .
their purpose for selling grain across the border was not as a protest against any board or any particular legislation .
they were trying to maximize their profits .
in many cases the people who were doing this all across the border were trying to maximize their profits .
they found themselves in the situation that if they did not get the best prices for their goods their farms could go under .
they could go broke .
they were trying to provide for the livelihood of their families .
they had worked all their lives and were saying they had to do something or they would go under .
nobody wants to go under .
they made an effort by doing that , but the legislation stated that they could not .
one court case amazed me .
an individual had broken into a farm residence , ransacked the property , killed three dogs , set fire to a tractor and stolen a pick - up truck .
later he was apprehended and convicted .
he received a sentence of community service .
the same day a farmer was brought in who had tried to maximize his profits by taking his crop across the border .
he was taken away in shackles and chains .
i have been screaming at the government for ages about consecutive sentences .
Clifford Olson should not be serving one life sentence ; he should be serving eleven .
we finally got a consecutive sentencing .
we got it for a farmer who tried to maximize his profits by taking his crop across the border .
that is the wisdom of the justice system .
it is terribly frustrating to look at farmers being hauled off in chains and shackles while a guy who destroys and steals thousands and thousands of dollars worth of property gets community service .
an hon. member :
shameful .
Mr. Myron Thompson :
it is absolutely ridiculous .
all they are asking for in the region of Wild Rose is an opportunity to market their own product , the same opportunity for every individual producer or manufacturer of any kind in the whole country .
why are they being targeted as the ones who cannot ?
they are asking for that opportunity .
they are not asking to scrap the wheat board .
they want to keep the wheat board as an option , as one of the choices they may make in marketing their goods .
that is common sense .
when I was a young fellow farming and raising crops I did not decide where we sold our grain .
although it was in a different country , we would load the truck and he would instruct me on where to deliver the grain .
he had made some phone calls and had chosen the place where he would deliver his grain .
guess why he chose the place ?
it was because he was maximizing his profits .
it was the best price .
if the test was not quite as good as they wanted it , I would go to another place that would take the grain , maybe at a lower price .
we had choices all over .
that was fairly nice .
we did not have a body of people accountable to no one to tell us what we should do with our grain .
we did not have to get something signed by a group of wheat board individuals about whose expertise we were not too certain .
the government is asking farmers in the western prairies to continue the same process .
bill C - 4 does not change anything .
even the agricultural minister from Alberta writes that it was extremely disappointing to discover the changes served only to continue government control of grain marketing , that no other industry or no other individual was being treated in this unique manner , and that in many respects it was something requiring close scrutiny before passage of the proposed legislation .
the minister of agriculture in Alberta pointed out a number of things in his letter that were wrong with the legislation .
much of it applied simply to the fact that they lived in a free country .
when will they start giving people the freedom they ought to have to do with their product as they see fit ?
they are the ones that sweat hard .
they are the ones who put the seed in the ground .
they are the ones who try to chase the hail clouds away .
they do not even know if they will get a grain crop into the bin , but when they get there they should be allowed to own it and to choose how to market it .
it is their crop .
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris - Moose Mountain , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to rise to speak on this topic , the most important topic in my entire constituency .
interest in the bill is growing and growing and growing every week .
ever since the wheat board began it presented a delusion to many western Canadian farmers .
the hon. member for Yorkton - Melville emphasized the use of the word maximizing .
if the returns to the farmers of western Canada are to be maximized , it involves another component , transportation .
we will talk about that later .
that is what a lawyer for the Canadian Wheat Board had to say .
you come west and try to sell the Canadian Wheat Board with statements like that .
less than three months ago we had a major dumping of Canadian grain into the Iranian market at $ 15 a tonne less than the world price .
we only found out about that just a few days ago .
i would like to read a few statements from that annual report .
historically the Canadian Wheat Board at numerous times has not marketed grain to ensure the maximum return to the farmers .
now hear what it had to say : " All proceeds from sales , less Canadian Wheat Board marketing costs , are passed on to the farmers '' .
if it is operating totally on behalf of the farmers then they had better take a look at what they are trying to do in Bill C - 4 .
if the farmer is smart enough to grow the grain , he is smart enough to market the grain .
we all know what is going to happen .
that is before World War II.
the next point is : " The role , structure and powers of the Canadian Wheat Board changed drastically during the war .
it became the federal government ' s chief means of controlling wheat prices '' .
the wheat board is in a position and it is attempting to control prices , not to do what my hon. member has in this amendment , maximize the prices .
it has not been the responsibility - and we have enough evidence that it has not always sought out to operate in the best interests .
let me read again from this report : " Its main aim was to limit grain price increases so as to safeguard the government ' s wage and price controls '' .
who paid that price ?
point three : " When world market conditions began to push up wheat prices in 1943 the government granted the Canadian Wheat Board its monopoly powers to enable it to impose strict controls over grain prices '' .
the Canadian Wheat Board is doing exactly the same thing today .
this report , which came from two eminent scholars , said further : " The Canadian Wheat Board was the government ' s instrument of choice in the immediate post - war period to control wheat prices - into a peacetime market economy '' .
they used the wheat of the hardworking prairie farmers to the benefit not of the prairie farmers .
that was not utmost in their minds .
1120
it dumps wheat on to a foreign market where there is no competition and sells it for less money .
that is a terrible shame , and it exists today .
i want to draw attention also to the control of the grain industry by the government .
we read that lawyers have said that the first responsibility of the Canadian Wheat Board is to the government and the producers are secondary .
we out west are tired of that attitude .
we are fed up .
let me read : " Control of the grain trade by a government agency was consistent with the aims of those Canadian bureaucrats who were dictated to introducing the principles of Keynesian economics into the regulation of the Canadian marketplace '' .
i know what the hon. member said .
i know that people are saying that the act was made in Ottawa and therefore it must be good .
do not be fooled .
they never adopted one single principle of the strategy committee that came before them .
not one principle is embedded in this new act .
they predetermined what the act was going to be .
they went through the phoney stage of talking to people .
the bill is before us now without one single recommendation from the advisory board .
i say that this Canadian Wheat Board bill that we have today is going to do one thing for sure if it is passed .
the number of people opposed to the monopoly of the grain market industry , the number of producers , is going to drop , drop , drop until we reach a real revolution on the prairies because of the government ' s monopoly in this bill .
i wish everybody opposite would come out to the prairies , talk to the people .
it is a crying shame that an industry that brings billions and billions of dollars into this country cannot even control itself .
the big bad government controls it .
it is a terrible shame .
i beg them to read the bill and not to support it .
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , some people will try to say that because this is just the preamble of the bill that they are seeking to amend that it is not important and it is not necessary .
i would like to argue that point very vigorously .
this is a very necessary amendment .
for the record I would just like to read what I consider to be the most important portion of this amendment :
whereas such an organization will have a very significant effect on the producers of grain and must therefore have the securing of the best financial return to them as its object and first priority and must be accountable to them for its performance .
in other words , this amendment places fiduciary responsibility on the board to act in the best interests of farmers .
about six weeks ago -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
excuse me .
we do not seem to be getting the French translation .
could we confirm that we are getting the French translation , please .
perhaps if the member resumes we can try it again .
Mr. Lee Morrison :
Mr. Speaker , I do not know at what point the translators may have been cut off .
i will backtrack just a bit .
i read the portion of the amendment which I feel is most important and I stated that I feel this is extremely important because it places fiduciary responsibility on the board to act in the best interests of farmers .
about six weeks ago a three - justice panel of the Manitoba Court of Appeal ruled that the Canadian Wheat Board has no fiduciary duty to make the best possible deals on farmers ' behalf or even to treat them equally and with fairness .
the board ' s only legal obligation , according to this panel , is not to farmers but to Ottawa .
this is supposed to be our board , but it has no obligation to serve us .
anything which can be added to this bill , even if it is only in the preamble , is bound to be an improvement .
the fascinating thing about Bill C - 4 is that it is equally repugnant to organizations as diverse in their outlook as the National Farmers Union and the Western Canadian Wheat Growers .
i have been polling my constituents specifically on this bill to determine how the majority of them would wish me to vote on their behalf .
thanks to the brilliance of this government we now have no postal service .
with no postal service I cannot complete my poll to find out how the people in my constituency would like me to vote on this bill .
however , I have done other polling on the Canadian Wheat Board with my constituents .
i have also done formal scientific polling by telephone through a professional polling organization .
i have a pretty good handle on how they feel .
it is regrettable that the government , with all of its grunting about going back to the people to find out what they are thinking , does not do a little more of this type of work .
when it does have its road shows and it goes about to get the opinion of people on the issues of the day it is too bad it does not pay attention to the results it gets .
that is the Ottawa way .
bud the Spud over there would have us always believe that these are the people with our interests at heart .
they know what is best for us poor , benighted , agricultural drones of western Canada .
we do not know what is good for us but , man , Ottawa sure can show us the way .
i have polled my constituents and , to my surprise , I discovered that on one commodity , that commodity being wheat , they want in my riding to retain single desk selling .
however , for barley they want dual marketing .
they did not get a chance , when the government had its famous plebiscite last January and February , to vote on that option .
they got a chance to say " are we doing to have barley all onboard or all off board ? "
what the farmers actually would have liked was not on the ballot .
Mr. Myron Thompson :
you listen up over there , you one Liberal .
Mr. Lee Morrison :
i wish the hon. member for Wild Rose would quit heckling .
he is throwing me off .
i know how my constituents stand on that particular issue , but I do not know how they are going to come out on Bill C - 4 because there is nothing in Bill C - 4 which directly relates to whether or not we retain single desk marketing .
there is nothing substantive -
Mr. Wayne Easter :
the most changes in its history .
Mr. Lee Morrison :
i hear a voice in the wilderness telling me that there have been substantive changes .
i suppose that the reference will be to this remarkable new elected board , a board which will be ruled in effect by appointees from Ottawa who will tell them what to do , when to do it and how to do it .
with 10 elected members , the government need only get three of those ten to agree with their appointed hacks and they will have the majority .
this is democracy ?
the CEO is a government appointee .
this is pseudo - democracy .
this is a Soviet type of democracy , if I may use the term loosely .
this brings me to the point that we do not have questions and comments at report stage .
i did want to make a comment to the hon. member for Wild Rose when he was expressing surprise at the discrepancy in sentencing of people who committed serious criminal offences and those who broke the wheat board regulations .
i would suggest to him that he should read a very excellent book entitled The Gulag Archipelago in which it is spelled out very clearly that in the prison system in the Soviet Union the people who were most severely dealt with were those who had committed political crimes .
ordinary criminals who merely robbed , raped , or killed people were treated relatively leniently even in the camps .
however , it was the political criminals who were nailed to the wall .
i think the hon. member should take that into consideration .
it is very easy to explain if one stops and thinks about it .
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , we in the New Democratic Party caucus support the preamble in Bill C - 4 and , quite frankly , do not understand why the government is so opposed .
there is no question that the agriculture sector is an integral part of the Canadian economy .
there should be no question that we need an organization that will work to secure the best financial return for all producers .
grain producers in Canada recognize the value of marketing their product through one body .
they recognize the value of working together and having a system that gives small and large producers opportunities and viability .
producers have survived tough economic times because of the wheat board .
i believe that the Canadian Wheat Board has the support of the majority of producers and there are very few who have not supported the wheat board .
i and my caucus will continue to encourage changes that will see the board fully elected by producers as well as the chair and CEO appointed by the board .
i urge the government to work in that direction .
however , I do want to mention that for the sticks and stones throwing between potato producers , grain producers and someone else , I think it is extremely important that we work to unite this country and to understand the different areas of the country , whether it be the east , the middle east or the west .
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I was under the mistaken impression growing up that this was a free country .
i listened to what the hon. member for Cypress Hills - Grasslands was saying about the Gulag Archipelago and the treatment of Soviet citizens who dared to challenge the government .
that was their crime .
that is why we see the disparity of treatment in this country .
when anybody dares to challenge the government by directly defying what the government has ordered shall be , they will pay a very severe price indeed .
i started out by saying that I thought this was a free country .
as I grew older , I began to recognize that we actually live in a police state , and we do .
we have environment police , we have tax police , we have land police , we have regulatory police .
we even have in this country egg police and milk police .
can you imagine the serious circumstances of the Canadian people if by God we did not control the production of eggs and we did not control the production of milk , butter and cream ?
what a threat to our national security that would be .
the only thing that we do not have is pork police .
we should have because we know about all the pork that goes on on the other side .
as a person who lives on the west coast of British Columbia , and there is virtually no grain farming taking place in the riding I represent , I come to Ottawa and I get to understand the grain issue a little more .
as my hon. colleague said , it takes them away in shackles and chains , fines them tens of thousands , if not hundreds of thousands of dollars , confiscates their equipment and just about drives them out of business .
this is not marijuana or heroin or cocaine .
we are talking about grain .
what does the government do ?
it takes the people and treats them like that .
i suggest , Mr. Speaker , that you can get away with this kind of treatment of your citizens for a time .
the Liberal Party members are the ones who dreamed up the egg police , the milk police and the grain police .
they want the government to control all aspects of our lives .
there are also the gun police -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
on a point of order , the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the fact of the matter is that it was not the Liberal Party .
it was a request from the producers themselves calling for national products marketing agencies and these requests were abided by in terms of living up to the wishes -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Chair thanks the hon. member for that point of clarification .
resuming debate , the hon. member for Skeena .
Mr. Mike Scott :
Mr. Speaker , all I have to do is remember people like Eugene Whelan when I think about the kind of Liberal approach to managing and controlling all aspects of our economy and the kind of marketing boards that were set up by the Liberals in the sixties and the seventies .
we all remember the trainload of rotten eggs .
to conclude my remarks , we live in what is ostensibly a free country , but we continue to encroach on the freedoms and the rights of citizens by such things as the grain police .
members opposite might think that this is humorous but I tell you , Mr. Speaker , that there will be a day of reckoning for treating people like this .
there is going to be a time when this is no longer tolerated .
i cannot say how that will come about .
i cannot say when it will come about .
but I can say that you cannot treat your citizens like this on an ongoing basis without serious repercussions .
i would ask hon. members in this House today who are going to be voting on this bill to consider the ramifications .
this is an issue that is very important to many people in the prairie provinces in western Canada and we cannot treat them like this .
we cannot expect them to continue to live in a civil society on these kinds of terms and conditions .
with that , I will conclude my remarks and thank the House for its indulgence .
Mr. Inky Mark ( Dauphin - Swan River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to stand in this House and bring the concerns of the farmers of Dauphin - Swan River .
during my short break at home I heard many concerns about the new bill , about the attempted change to the Canadian Wheat Board .
i must say that the majority of the farmers in my constituency support the Canadian Wheat Board , but they want real change .
they want change that is going to impact the farmers ' lives .
i really have no way of responding to these types of questions because the Canadian Wheat Board is a very big monopoly that basically dictates .
it is very paternalistic in its approach .
farmers in Dauphin - Swan River are asking for a real change that will bring about real democracy .
the purpose of the Canadian Wheat Board should be for the benefit of the grower and the producer , not the people who live in Ottawa who sit in this House .
as you know , in this country we really do not have a justice system , not the way the courts operate .
these farmers are treated in the worst way , worse even than criminals , by far .
that is a question that is continuously raised .
these people probably did break the law as it exists today in transporting their products to market , but we need justice in this country .
we have to treat them in a fair and equal way .
as my colleague indicated previously , that is the political crime that they have committed by doing this .
anyway , the people of Dauphin - Swan River feel that this is not fair .
it is not fair to treat people in this manner .
the third concern is about the Canadian Wheat Board and the control of the direction of the full grain and how they market the grain and how they transport it out of this country .
considering that the port of Churchill was built in the thirties , someone at the federal level had a vision for the farmers of western Canada back in 1930 .
we have lost that vision over the last 60 years .
that port is totally underutilized .
the big advantage of using the port of Churchill as I have vented in this House is that it is 6,800 kilometres shorter to European markets than it is from the Thunder Bay port .
yet , over the last 60 years this port has been totally neglected .
in fact this year the Canadian Wheat Board has shipped , I believe , less than 400,000 tons through the port of Churchill .
therefore , on behalf of the farmers , the wheat board has to increase the amount of grain that it ships out of this country .
it is high time that the grain started moving north and south instead of east and west at a cost to the farmer .
there is no doubt that the Canadian Wheat Board has been a good thing in the past .
i mean in the past because I am reminded by older farmers who went through the tough times of the 1930 s and the pre - war period that the wheat board was there for their protection .
today we live in the 1990 s .
this is the age where governments talk about entrepreneurship , Internet technology , the shrinking global economy .
there is no doubt that there are many farmers out there who can ship their own products much more effectively and efficiently than a monopoly .
it is all about accountability .
the constituents of Dauphin - Swan River are looking for accountability with the new Canadian Wheat Board accountable to the farmers and not to the politicians in Ottawa .
they want accountability through the organization ' s being more transparent and they also want more options .
the final analysis is that they want the Canadian Wheat Board to work on behalf of the farmers and not on behalf of big business and government .
Mr. Gerry Ritz ( Battlefords - Lloydminster , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today as a western Canadian farmer certainly concerned with the future of our grain industry .
the quality of life on western Canadian farms is definitely tied to the power of this unaccountable wheat board .
there is a growing dissension with the market status quo on the prairies today .
if the minister were to hold meetings in the west , he would find the people attending would most certainly have different things to say .
our input costs are rising .
the end of the Crow drastically increased our transportation costs .
Canadian Wheat Board grains are backlogged and plugging the system .
as a result , farm returns are now non - existent .
as a result of wheat board policies , we also find that we are not allowed to bring our feed grains and so on into different marketplaces .
interprovincial trade and access to these markets is not there for us .
the hon. member from Manitoba talked about using the port of Churchill .
there are many sections and subsections of Bill C - 4 that farmers in my riding on both sides of this issue agree are fundamentally wrong , mainly the continuation of the unaccountability to producers of their board .
the cash purchase clause that they are trying to put in through Bill C - 4 circumvents the final payment values derived through the pooling system that we have now .
that is a major point .
four are then appointed by the minister to sit on this board and the president or CEO is appointed on the recommendation of the minister .
all these people are there at the discretion of the minister and can be removed at any time should they go against the minister .
the Canadian Wheat Board also may indemnify from , in layman ' s terms remove , any legal liability or responsibility for the actions of its employees .
this section goes on to say that this also covers the employees ' heirs and legal representatives and would cover all costs , charges and expenses included in amounts paid to settle or satisfy a judgment .
no one is accountable .
this clause certainly protects the board over the producers it serves .
the Canadian Wheat Board annual operations plan will be submitted to the minister and will require his approval before it can be implemented .
this certainly would seem to circumvent the elected portion of this board .
for the record I certainly do not oppose the Canadian Wheat Board concept in principle .
however , when I see the entrenched lack of accountability of the board in this bill , my constituents , through me , can do nothing but oppose it until it can be amended for a positive impact on the depressed industry we see in western Canada .
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise to speak on Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board .
i wish it were to be some real amendments because I think the Canadian Wheat Board is mired in the last century and has yet to come into this century and we are just about to go into the next one .
i hoped this organization would have wanted to bring itself up to date and that the minister would have wanted to bring the organization up to date to address the global marketplace in which we now live .
my interpretation of this bill is that it is just a reiteration of where the board stands .
the bill maintains the board with arm ' s length monopoly powers when many farmers wish the board could be opened up .
yet farmers in Ontario can operate differently .
and I thought it was a free country .
i find it rather strange that we would say you have only one buyer and no other buyer for your grain when there are people around the world who would like to participate and purchase our grain .
there are buyers in the United States we know would like to buy our grain , but we have to give it to the wheat board .
that is a travesty and an insult to the farmers on the prairies who are part of the great bread basket of the world , who have worked hard to produce a wonderful environment and a way of life that sometimes involves struggle .
and the wheat board sits there with more and more powers and makes some noise about trying to get itself modernized , but when we take a look at the intent of the legislation nothing has happened .
the minister knows it but the minister will not say it .
all he wants to do is to entrench that little monopoly .
if monopoly is not bad enough , we have to add secrecy on top of that .
the auditor general is not allowed to look into the workings of the wheat board .
the legislation prevents him from doing that .
access to information that allows anybody access to government documentation allows us to ask questions about government but we cannot ask questions about the wheat board .
the law says that we cannot ask questions about the wheat board and have them answered because we are specifically denied access to the Canadian Wheat Board and what is going on there .
yet it is a monopoly that is protected by the government .
an individual cannot ask questions through access to information .
it is a complete and absolute closed door shop and we as parliamentarians and as Canadians have no idea what is going on in that organization but we are being asked to endorse the status quo .
surely we as parliamentarians have the right to know what is going on in that organization .
this perfunctory thing that we are going to have a few elected members on the board I do not think will change very much because those members ' hands will be tied .
the minister will have a majority on the board .
it is fine for the minister to tell us that this will be great stuff since he will be opening it up for elections .
but if they are a minority on the board , the minister can get what he wants .
that is how he can maintain his ironclad policy of no information about the board .
i think about the people who have stood up for democratic rights in Canada .
we have seen people in China stand up for democratic rights who were sent off to jail .
the whole world stood up and claimed it was an outrage that people who stand up for their rights in China should go to jail and be punished severely by the state .
yet we have farmers standing up for their rights in this country who are saying all they want is the right to sell what they produce to a buyer who is prepared to buy their produce .
is that so bad ?
Ontario farmers yes , farmers in other provinces yes , but not the prairie farmer when it comes to producing grain for human consumptions and grain for export .
it is ludicrous that any government should take this dictatorial attitude today .
it is an offence and an affront to democracy and to all of Canadians that farmers would be locked into this type of situation .
i want to let the government know that I am upset because I believe in openness and accountability in government .
it says " the corporation shall indemnify present or former directors or officers who acted - against criminal charges '' .
i know that they have backed off a little on committing .
rather than " shall " indemnify , it is " may " indemnify .
to me that is not a reversal .
it just says if we feel that it is in our own interests we will indemnify these people against criminal actions if they act honestly and in good faith .
it even goes on to say " - in case of a criminal or administrative action or proceeding that is enforced by monetary penalty believed on reasonable grounds that the conduct was lawful '' .
just as long as they think or stand up and say " I think my conduct is lawful " the board will indemnify them .
i have heard of lots of situations when people have been in court and have said " I thought I was on the right " and the court says " no , you were on the wrong '' .
they are left with a sentence and the cost of their own defence .
but we now find that the government is going stand behind , if it so chooses , past and former people who have committed illegal acts , maybe with good intentions .
lots of people have found themselves on the wrong side of the law with good intentions .
let us hope we do not .
let us hope the government does not get there either .
i am really concerned about the wheat board and the fact that it is wrapped in a cloak of secrecy that is ironclad .
we can get no information out of this organization .
this government is doing nothing about it in a free and democratic society .
people who want to do something today get dragged off to jail in irons .
i emphasize in irons .
i talked to several RCMP in my riding , one who had 20 years service on the force .
he said there was only one occasion that he had to drag an offender off to jail in irons .
he was a rather violent offender .
an hon. member :
did he get caned ?
Mr. John Williams :
i am not sure whether he got caned but he certainly got locked up in irons and presumably locked up elsewhere for a long time .
the point is that farmers from Saskatchewan and Manitoba were taken away in irons .
these were non - violent people .
we have seen all kinds of demonstrations on the west coast and elsewhere .
i hope the government takes these points very seriously and amends the legislation to make it a lot more tolerable than it is .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to speak to the bill .
it appears the government is trying to ram through a bill that will strengthen the dictatorial powers of the Canadian Wheat Board and will give it a tremendous amount of power to operate within a scope that is pleasing to it .
i am not from a prairie part of the country , but it has always been my assumption that the Canadian Wheat Board had a responsibility to operate in the best interest of prairie wheat farmers .
if this is the case certainly the bill we are debating today does not do that .
it gives the Canadian Wheat Board the power to operate in the best interest of itself and of its political influence in the House .
the government of the day is dominated by members from the province of Ontario and other provinces that are not involved with the Canadian Wheat Board .
they have a lot of authority in the debate and will have the power of the vote by sheer numbers .
the government is influenced by a part of the country that has no particular interest in the Canadian Wheat Board because it does not apply to the growing of grains in those other provinces .
they will ram through a bill that will impose a detrimental effect on wheat farmers on the prairies and in the west .
i have some personal knowledge of the operation of the Canadian Wheat Board .
i return for a moment to the fact that it should be assumed the purpose of the Canadian Wheat Board is to get the best possible price for grain products for prairie farmers .
if that is the case it would only seem logical the wheat board would be willing to sell products on behalf of farmers in a manner that would be in the best interest of farmers , which means whoever approaches with a proposition that would bring a good price for the product .
there was no government to government financing involved .
it was cash on the barrel head .
the Canadian Wheat Board would not supply the product .
it would not take the products it had in the elevators and sell it through this additional source of marketing for cash money at a higher than average price .
to make matters worse , I have absolute knowledge that the sales offered to the Canadian Wheat Board never went through any of the other sources of established marketing of the Canadian Wheat Board .
they were lost to other countries that supplied the same product to customers willing to pay cash to the Canadian Wheat Board , if it would sell it , but it would not sell it .
they not only lost several cash deals .
they lost the sale , period .
the purchase went to another country .
i have been in business all my life , not in the grain business but in business .
if those in the private sector have a product to sell , they want to sell it where they get the best price for it , the cleanest deal and the best benefit for their business .
certainly that is not the case with the Canadian Wheat Board .
it cannot be the case with the Canadian Wheat Board based on the examples I have expressed today .
i am happy to see there are Liberal members in the House today who have a direct interest in this matter and who have a responsibility .
some hon. members :
one Liberal .
Mr. Dick Harris :
oh , one Liberal .
that shows just how much the Liberal government is interested in what the people of Canada have to say .
we are truly representing the farmers from the prairie provinces over which the Canadian Wheat Board has jurisdiction .
it shows how much the Liberal government cares about representation on this side of the House on this very important issue .
we are talking about the livelihood of western Canadian grain farmers .
we are talking about the livelihood of families .
we are talking about the buoyancy of the economy in the prairie provinces .
those farmers depend on good prices for their product .
they depend on good markets for their product .
in huge numbers they would like to have the ability to grow agricultural products and sell them without having the government in their face every step of the way and so that they get maximum value for the fruits of their labour .
this has to do with rights .
we are talking about the right of Canadian citizens to work hard , to toil long hours at their occupation , which in this case is farming , and to expect the harder they work the more they will be rewarded .
is that too much to ask ?
bill C - 4 takes away that right .
it gives the Canadian Wheat Board more power to say to prairie farmers that it does not care how hard they work .
it does not care how big their farm loans are .
it does not care how many kids they have to educate .
it does not care how many mouths they have to feed .
the government will tell them how much money they can make from what they do for a living .
that is what it is telling prairie farmers by way of the bill .
that is simply unacceptable .
i am embarrassed for the Liberal member in the House today , who is not from the prairie provinces incidentally .
the member sits and represents the government on this line of thought .
it takes away our right to succeed as a result of our hard work and labour .
the government has been famous for being in the faces of Canadians and holding them back from success and opportunity .
this is simply one more example of that .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
earlier there was a question from a member of the Reform Party directed to the member for Essex - Kent with reference to the export licence for wheat and barley .
i have a copy of that export licence and I would like to table it .
while I am on my feet , in terms of transparency of records , I refer members opposite to the Canadian Wheat Board annual report which clearly shows the wheat board has obtained -
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the hon. member wishes to deposit this paper .
Mr. Lee Morrison ( Cypress Hills - Grasslands , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
we are debating a matter of very grave importance to the people of western Canada .
we are debating legislation over which people can go to jail .
for the last two hours there have never been more than two Liberal members in the House and that is shameful .
some hon. members :
shame .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I am very pleased to speak today on the report stage of Bill C - 4 , an Act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts .
the approach I took in examining this bill is that it concerns -
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member , but the hon. member for Cypress Hills - Grasslands is rising on a point of order .
Mr. Lee Morrison :
madam Speaker , we do not have a quorum .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
ring the bells .
and the bells having rung :
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
we now have a quorum .
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te :
madam Speaker , as I was saying before the call for a quorum , I am pleased to speak today on the report stage of the Act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts .
i was struck first of all by the dichotomy surrounding the necessity of organizing the wheat trade .
in my region , no one denies the pertinence of this .
however , there are significant elements missing between the desire to organize the wheat trade properly and what this bill contains .
the first thing is that the bill does not give sufficient power to farmers or board members , to those who make their living selling their wheat , to those who have to live with the effects of government policies in this area .
in this bill , could the government not have used the opportunity to make sure the farmers were given a voice , so that the reserve fund would truly be a management tool ?
we have experienced this in other areas where , because sufficient reserves were not made for hard times , the money is often taken from the consolidated revenue fund , and , when this is done , the people end up paying , even if they have nothing to do with this type of business .
the best example of that is what the Conservatives made us go through with unemployment insurance several years ago .
there were no reserves , we had terrible deficits , and people who are contributing to employment insurance today are still paying for this lack of foresight .
we must avoid this type of situation in the area of the wheat sales .
we could very well go through this type of experience again in the coming years because , we know from past experience that the wheat market can be very volatile .
there can be some very good years and also some very bad years .
everything is linked to crop results in other countries and the buying power of other countries , to international politics .
so there should have been a reserve fund ensuring solid management to balance variations between good years and bad years , and there is nothing on this in the bill .
at the beginning of my presentation , I said that I would address this bill by looking at its impact on Quebec , and there is a significant impact on oilseeds management .
in Quebec , oilseeds represent a promising market .
it is a market for which production could be increased in the future .
when we look at this bill and when we consider that it could cover oilseeds , this is perhaps not the way of the future for Quebec , precisely because there are markets here , such as linseed or other products , that could be developed and that would become mixed up in a type of management that is not suitable for them .
so things should not be mixed up .
we should avoid adding barriers in areas that already work and we should ensure that the Canadian Wheat Board does not intervene in areas that are already well structured .
this is an important issue for Quebec farmers , and this is worth considering because we all know that agriculture is undergoing tremendous changes .
in the past , there has been a lot of specialization in agriculture , since there was a sort of division in production : dairy products were mostly the specialty of Ontario and Quebec , especially Quebec ; other products were the specialty of the west , and so on .
but with the expected changes to international agreements and the desire to diversify production in the various regions of Canada , we must make sure that we leave the door open to the future and do not put in place structures , legislation , and regulatory requirements that would then stand in the way of development in these sectors .
we know that when bureaucracy gets a hold on a sector , it is very difficult to dislodge it .
it would perhaps be better to do so something about this now .
there are other aspects to this bill that are of concern to Quebec ' s agricultural sector .
there is no such provision in this bill .
in Quebec , the agricultural tradition is such that the federal government would have wanted to ensure , for instance , that the directors are elected by the producers , by those representing the industry .
there is no such provision in the legislation .
while appearing to be open , the government is maintaining significant control over the Canadian Wheat Board .
the terms and conditions for electing directors are set by the government .
the president of the board is appointed by the governor in council on the minister ' s recommendation .
does that not leave the door open to partisanship ?
would it not have been possible to find a way of ensuring that the president is selected without any appearance of conflict of interest or partisanship ?
those are some of the many questions we can ask ourselves about this bill as we consider a rather substantial amendment .
some major changes are being proposed , and this legislation will not be reviewed for a while .
we must make sure it is a framework law that will facilitate operations in Canada ' s agricultural sector , that will facilitate the wheat trade , and that will allow the various regions to develop new products without having to face administrative obstacles or restrictions we can no longer afford in the current context of free trade .
all in all , this is a bill which had to be introduced .
it would have been possible to make it acceptable with a number of changes .
the government made some efforts , but not enough .
if the government does not support amendments - particularly the ones that we are proposing - that would make for more democratic and longer term management of the Canadian Wheat Board , so as to even out the good and the bad economic years , the Bloc Quebecois will have to oppose the bill .
i urge the government majority to listen to our arguments and accept those that are relevant .
i hope we can state our views during the debate on the other groups of motions , particularly in these areas , and convince the government to adopt the best possible legislation for Canada ' s wheat trade .
Mr. Jim Pankiw ( Saskatoon - Humboldt , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , it is a pleasure to rise today during report stage to contribute the very important debate on this bill .
it is important to me for a number of reasons .
i represent the constituency of Saskatoon - Humboldt which has a significant rural portion .
this bill is going to have a dramatic impact not only on the rural component of the constituency but the urban as well .
although Saskatoon is a growing city with a vibrant economy , agriculture is still a core industry in Saskatchewan . Therefore the bill will affect not only the rural part of my constituency but the entire province .
although I have lived in Saskatoon since the early 1980 s and I represent Saskatoon - Humboldt , I am originally from a family farm in Unity , Saskatchewan . All my life I have been actively involved in farming until I got into politics .
i believe this bill will impact not only on all my constituents but it goes deep enough to affect my family .
there is a great deal of concern on the prairies about the contents of this bill and of course it is very well founded .
the amendments that have been advanced by my Reform colleagues would improve Bill C - 4 and address the concerns farmers are raising about the bill .
one need only travel throughout the constituencies of Saskatchewan and into the small towns and coffee shops to hear the discussion on the bill and the widespread opposition to it .
the opposition is from many angles .
however , I would like to specifically address Motion No. 5 which was submitted by my colleague from Prince George - Peace River .
that motion would allow the entire board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board to be elected which along with the minister would decide who would be president of the board .
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) :
i thought that we were still discussing Motion No. 1 .
i would encourage the debate to go in that direction .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i would ask the hon. member to please confine his comments to Motion No. 1 , which is being discussed right now .
Mr. Jim Pankiw :
madam Speaker , Motion No. 1 is with respect to returns that producers will get for their commodity .
this has a direct bearing on that because it will affect the returns .
this debate is perhaps one of the most important debates that will occur in my term in this Parliament as the representative of the constituents of Saskatoon - Humboldt .
to continue , the current bill the way it stands , if passed , would allow 10 directors to be elected by the farmers , but the remaining 5 directors of the Canadian Wheat Board would be appointed by the minister , of course one being the president .
it would seem logical that there would be opposition to that when a full third of the board is being appointed by the minister .
that would ensure that the government ' s grip on the activities of the Canadian Wheat Board is maintained and the desire for accountability and for farmers to have control and direction over the wheat board through a farmer elected board is circumvented by allowing the appointment of members by the minister .
furthermore , if experience tells us anything , Liberal ministers have not been shy in the past about handing out plum patronage positions to their party faithful .
to illustrate just how bad this can get , I would like to cite some examples that have taken place so far this year .
the Liberals have made 510 prime appointments to date to the Senate and various boards , agencies and commissions .
this practice of patronage was denounced by the Liberals when they sat in opposition to the Mulroney government but now that they are in power , they are not only carrying on the practice of political patronage appointments , but taking it to extremes .
as unbelievable as it is , it seems that they are even worse than Mulroney with their political patronage appointments .
i would suggest that the Liberals are truly number one at doling out parliamentary pork .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
this member is far off base in terms of talking about Motion No. 1 .
he should be talking about what the motion is about .
what does this have to do with Motion No.1 ?
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. parliamentary secretary has a very good point .
we would ask the member for Saskatoon - Humboldt to get to the point and stay there .
Mr. Jim Pankiw :
Mr. Speaker , the point I am making is directly relevant because they are going to be allowed to appoint the members of the board of directors .
i think we have to look at past examples of their appointments to see what we can expect .
therefore it has direct relevance and I am simply pointing out examples such as the former president of the women ' s commission , Joan Koury , appointed to the IRB and former Liberal MP , Ron Fewchuk , appointed -
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
if the member would refer to the point of order , he would recognize very clearly that the points he is raising are not on the topic in terms of Motion No. 1 .
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
i would consider that the whole issue of the board of directors is very relevant to Motion No. 1 .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Chair would appreciate it if the member for Saskatoon - Humboldt would confine his comments to the appointments to be made to the board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board .
the hon. member will then be relevant .
Mr. Jim Pankiw :
Mr. Speaker , that is fair enough .
my point is that the blatant examples of patronage from the past leave farmers wondering just how many Liberal cronies this government is going to appoint to the Canadian Wheat Board .
of course , these appointments will make the appointees beholden to their political masters since the government has ensured that the president of the Canadian Wheat Board will be an appointee .
they have ensured their control over the organization of the Canadian Wheat Board .
that is the fear and the concern of western Canadian farmers .
furthermore , their ability to appoint the members of the board of directors would ensure that the board of the Canadian Wheat Board is under that type of influence .
on the other hand , if Motion No. 5 of my colleague from Prince George - Peace River would be adopted , that would ensure that the board of the Canadian Wheat Board is democratic and accountable to its electors .
furthermore , these electors in consultation with the minister would select the president rather than the minister appointing who the president is going to be .
this is a fair and equitable amendment which I am hopeful at least the other parties would be able to support .
Neville Nankivell in the Financial Post had some interesting comments about the election of the board as it presently stands under Bill C - 4 .
he wrote that because the government still appoints directors , it will create a quasi - advisory group rather than a proper independent board of directors that should have the power to hire and fire the CEO .
the way the bill currently stands , that power will not be in the hands of the farmers , which is just further evidence of the type of control that the minister will have over them .
Nankivell also wrote that there is almost universal condemnation among farm groups of the government ' s intention to appoint the CEO .
yet the Liberals are determined in their desire to be able to do that .
as I stated earlier , it is for one reason .
it is so they can continue with their political patronage appointments .
that comes as no surprise .
with Bill C - 4 the Liberals want a board of directors which is mired in the past , not one that is structured to meet the demands of the 21 st century .
in fact when Ted Allen of the United Grain Growers appeared before the committee , he said that Bill C - 4 is fundamentally flawed and is an attempt to make time stand still or even turn back the clock .
western Canadian farmers need to look to the future and not be mired in the past by regressive Liberal policies which are based upon political patronage appointments .
in order to strengthen the measure of accountability , we also need to bring the Canadian Wheat Board under the purview of the Access to Information Act and the auditor general .
bill C - 4 does not propose to do that .
the election of the board is certainly important , but of equal importance is the scrutiny of its operations by the public and the federal government ' s watchdog .
however , this is not the only organization which the government has exempted from scrutiny .
canada Post and a litany of other crown corporations are not subject to access to information requests .
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner :
do you mean there is another wheat board ?
Mr. Jim Pankiw :
there are lots of them .
indeed , my colleague from Nanaimo - Alberni has been an advocate of opening up these organizations to scrutiny .
he has advanced private members ' bills on the subject and he has raised our awareness about the importance of not allowing government organizations to operate behind a veil of secrecy .
i hope that his efforts in this area will continue .
i know that his concerns certainly apply to the Canadian Wheat Board as presently structured .
i urge all members to consider that when they oppose this bill .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
pursuant to agreement made on Wednesday , November 19 , 1997 , the motion on Group No. 1 is deemed put and a recorded division deemed requested and deemed deferred .
we will now proceed to Group No. 2 .
pursuant to agreement made on Wednesday , November 19 , 1997 , all motions in Group No. 2 are deemed put and seconded .
this group contains Motions Nos. 2 , 31 and 41 .
motion No. 2
that Bill C - 4 be amended by deleting Clause 2 .
motion No. 31
that Bill C - 4 be amended by deleting Clause 8 .
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) moved :
motion No. 41
that Bill C - 4 be amended by deleting Clause 24 .
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to rise today to speak to the second group of amendments .
as I said in my intervention on the first group , which comprised only one motion , the amendment put forward by my hon. colleague from Yorkton - Melville to create a preamble , it is very confusing .
i am sure it is not only confusing to us , but it must be confusing for the viewing public to follow how these 48 amendments have been grouped .
however , we will try to work our way through them .
group No. 2 consists of three amendments .
motion No. 41 was put forward by my hon. colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party .
in actual fact this clause would block a province from making changes which could be demanded by the majority of farmers in that province .
the official opposition believes quite strongly that this is undemocratic .
we point to a possible example in the future where one province might want to bring forward its own wheat board or wheat marketing board .
for example , Alberta might choose at some time in the future to have an Alberta wheat marketing board similar in structure to what exists for the farmers in Ontario .
the case can really be put that by having this binding on the provinces , this would prevent a province such as Alberta , Saskatchewan or Manitoba from doing that .
this particular clause further entrenches the inequity and the inequality of the Canadian Wheat Board .
what one province is free to do , in this case Ontario has its own wheat marketing board , another province in western Canada would be denied from doing .
the second motion in Group No. 2 is motion 31 , also put forward by me .
it has to do with removing all the references to the contingency fund .
this is where it really gets odd as to how the exact amendments are grouped .
this particular amendment No. 31 goes hand in glove with amendments and Motions Nos. 25 , 26 and 27 which are found in another group .
all of those amendments deal with deleting any reference in Bill C - 4 of the contingency fund .
at committee and while travelling throughout western Canada and speaking to farmers and farm groups in my riding and other ridings , it has become painfully obvious that the majority of farmers view this contingency fund as simply another tax on already overtaxed farmers .
that is why we have put forward these four amendments that would delete any reference to the contingency fund , the farmer supported , the farmer paid for contingency fund which currently exists in Bill C - 4 .
it is interesting to note that one of my colleagues earlier referred to the need to survey his constituents , his farmers in his riding .
he referred to the fact that he is prevented from doing this at the moment because of the postal strike .
i did survey the farmers in Prince George - Peace River when this bill ' s predecessor , Bill C - 72 , was before the House last winter .
the one question I asked was would you support a compulsory farmer check off to help establish a capital base for a contingency fund ?
an overwhelming 76.7 % of respondents , the actual farmers , Canadian Wheat Board farmers in Prince George - Peace River , said no they would not support that concept .
there are other polls which other members have done and that other entities have done across western Canada that would indicate a similar conclusion .
it is a major concern .
this is why it is accompanying Motions Nos. 25 , 26 , 27 which are in a subsequent group .
we need to pass that and remove any reference to the contingency fund .
how much time do I have , Mr. Speaker ?
an hon. member :
too much .
Mr. Jay Hill :
the hon. member from the governing party said " too much '' .
it has become painfully obvious that throughout the debate the Liberals do not want to see the bill properly debated .
that is why they hustled it off to committee without a proper second reading .
that is why we went through the charade -
an hon. member :
on a point of order , Mr. Speaker .
the member is not on the topic .
Mr. Jay Hill :
i am being very relevant to the main issue at stake here .
for the hon. member across the way to take the issue so lightly points to the problem .
over here we have members who have grown up on farms and farmed year after year in western Canada .
i will briefly address Motion No. 41 put forward by my hon. colleague .
the motion would delete the exclusion clause from the bill .
we run into a problem here .
i support the motion as put forward , but we must realize it goes hand in glove with a motion to delete the inclusion clause .
one great argument put forward by government members both in the limited debate in the House and at committee was that when a clause excludes certain types of grain from Canadian Wheat Board jurisdiction , in fairness there must also be an inclusion clause .
hon. members from the opposition responded by saying that was fine .
however , there is so much resistance and so much fear of the inclusion clause in the grain sector that we have said , if that is the strongest argument of the government against bringing forward an inclusion clause that hardly any farmer would support , let us take them both out .
motion No. 41 is part of Group No. 2 and moves to strike the exclusion clause .
it must be viewed in conjunction with the subsequent motion to delete the inclusion clause .
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise once again on Bill C - 4 and to deal with the three amendments in Group No. 2 . One of them is mine and two are from hon. members of the Reform Party .
i promise to be relevant , as relevant as members on the government side have been .
i promise not to be boring .
i hope that will please the Chair .
i will clarify a couple of points .
i do not believe anybody on this side of the House necessarily wants to see the demise of the Canadian Wheat Board .
it is very important to recognize that .
we are simply saying that we have the opportunity to make this the best possible legislation available so that western Canadian producers are able to take advantage of new techniques and new opportunities within legislation .
the legislation as put forward does not allow that to happen .
it is simply a regurgitation of the existing legislation with some minor amendments .
usually when legislation is being proposed there is at least one segment of the society affected that would totally support it .
i asked a number of witnesses in committee whether the divisiveness among producers in western Canada would stop , whether they would be happy to go forward with the legislation .
to a person , including those in support of Bill C - 4 , they said it would not stop divisiveness , that it would not stop the anger with respect to the controls Bill C - 4 would place on producers in western Canada .
i will speak to the three motions put forward in Group No. 2 . The first one , the deletion of clause 2 , put forward by the hon. member for Peace River , says that the act is binding on Her Majesty in the right of Canada or a province .
whether they come from Prince Edward Island or from Vancouver Island , it is very important for elected members of the House to have the opportunity to put forward their opinions .
i did not see that happen in committee .
i saw people put forward their concerns and their views , but they were not listened to .
if they had been listened to , the amendments we are speaking to right now would have passed at committee stage .
it was an opportunity for me to be at a committee hearing for the first time .
i actually thought we could include better amendments that would make the legislation workable .
it did not happen for the simple reason it was a foregone conclusion .
the witnesses were in effect wasting their breath in speaking to us .
it would have been nicer if we had listened and taken their concerns under advisement .
the provinces that are being affected should be listened to , the people of those provinces should be listened to and the provincial governments of those provinces should be listened to .
it is important for Canadians to understand what it is all about .
there are three pillars to the Canadian Wheat Board .
the first pillar is that of pooling .
that is not being dealt with in this amendment .
the second pillar of the Canadian Wheat Board is monopoly .
we have talked a lot about monopoly purchasing and the selling of one commodity , particularly wheat .
we will get into that as well at a later date when considering other amendments .
the third pillar of the Canadian Wheat Board , which is not necessarily a bad one , is that of government guarantees .
the reason we have the Canadian Wheat Board is that the federal government guaranteed producers initial payments and adjusted payments .
the reason I mention this is that the contingency fund being proposed in the legislation concerns not only me but producers .
the reason it concerns producers is that there is an opportunity for the Canadian Wheat Board and the government to charge producers , whether it be per bushel or per tonne , whether it be $ 1 or whether it be 10 垄 .
we do not know that yet .
that will be struck by the board .
it will have the opportunity via a tax to have a contingency fund that could be in excess of hundreds of millions of dollars .
it could be half a billion dollars if that is the way the Canadian Wheat Board wants to operate .
the danger is that ultimately if there is a contingency fund in those numbers the Canadian Wheat Board or the government could say there is no need for particular guarantees from governments .
guarantees could be funded out of a contingency fund .
this is a very serious danger to the existing Canadian Wheat Board and certainly to producers themselves .
there are some advantages and disadvantages , but the majority of people who spoke to us , whether pro or against the Canadian Wheat Board , indicated their desire not to have a contingency fund .
i have talked to producers , as have other members on this side of the House , who had serious concerns about the contingency fund .
the government wants a Canadian Wheat Board which is subject to the controls of government , of its executive officer and of members of the board .
if 10 of 15 board members are to be elected it does not mean the Canadian Wheat Board will be accountable to producers .
it will still be accountable to the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board .
it is written in the legislation that the minister has the final authority and say .
we should not be confused by the fact that 10 of 15 members will be accountable .
it should be made a truly elected board by having 15 of the 15 members elected by producers .
it could be made a truly democratic process by having the board hire the chief executive officer .
that makes sense corporately and has to be done .
my amendment speaks to the exclusion clause .
as the member for Peace River indicated , it is a marriage between two clauses , an exclusion clause and an inclusion clause .
in Bill C - 72 , the predecessor bill , inclusion was never mentioned .
now it is in this bill .
when asked at committee why there was an inclusion clause , the answer was simple : if we have exclusion then we have to have inclusion .
it was not a good answer .
we asked people who appeared before committee if they would be prepared to give up their exclusion rights to get rid of inclusion .
we literally heard from dozens of organizations and only three did not want it .
almost unanimously they said that in order to get rid of inclusion they would give up exclusion .
the motion has been put forward to get rid of exclusion .
the motion should pass .
we will deal with inclusion when that motion is being debated .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , thank you for giving me the floor so promptly .
bill C - 4 is a major bill for western grain producers , so much so that consideration of the bill had to be spread over more than a year .
in its great wisdom and clarity of vision , the Liberal government had planned to have Bill C - 72 passed during the 35 th Parliament , but the early call for a general election on June 2 forced us to scrap everything that had been done .
this meant a considerable waste of money .
i would , however , like to emphasize that , on the agriculture and agri - food committee , we heard the views of scores of people .
the large majority of them expressed discontent with the wording of Bill C - 4 , which will , according to the Liberals , modify the Canadian Wheat Board Act from a to z .
in our opinion , this is a very tiny step forward , and as a result I can announce to you , to the great chagrin of the hon. member for Malpeque , that we will support this amendment to Bill C - 4 for a number of different and important reasons .
one of the reasons is as follows .
i would like to know - and from you directly , Mr. Speaker - why the Prime Minister gave responsibility for the Canadian Wheat Board to a minister other than the minister of agriculture .
is the new minister of agriculture too incompetent to manage the Canadian Wheat Board on his own ?
that is my question .
does the Prime Minister not have confidence in him ?
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans on a point of order .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the Chair would consider that to be a point of debate , not a point of order .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
so , the government , under the Prime Minister , gave responsibility for this bill to the Minister of Natural Resources , on the grounds that he comes from the west .
i have more fingers on my hands than there are Liberal members from the West in this House , so he did not have a choice if they were going to give it to someone from the West .
so he gave it to the Minister of Natural Resources .
i suggested to my friend from Malpeque that the auditor general , who is above all reproach and whose appointment was approved by all parties in this House , should go and root through the books of the Canadian Wheat Board .
the Liberals turned the suggestion down saying that a group of auditors from the west - one of the famous accounting firms like Raymond , Chabot , Martin , Par 茅 in Quebec - could do the audit .
in the West it appears to be Touche Ross & Co.
my Reform colleagues went at the Prime Minister himself on several occasions because it appears that he gets a lot of financial support from these groups of auditors .
when an organization like the Canadian Wheat Board has its books audited , only the invoices presented are audited .
the auditors find that it matches the invoice , but do not check if the invoice is valid .
do you follow me ?
i think that the Reform Party , the Bloc Quebecois and all the opposition parties in this House agree that the auditor general should audit the books .
i made some calculations .
the Canadian Wheat Board will be managing sales representing between $ 6 billion and $ 7 billion .
that is a substantial amount .
a 1 % error would cost $ 600 million .
that is quite a lot of money .
you will tell me that I am exaggerating .
i agree , 1 % is too high .
that is $ 6 million .
i am pretty sure that if one thousandth of the sales were poorly managed , western farm producers would lose $ 6 million without anyone noticing .
but the auditor general , with his flair , with his team and with his expertise , would figure out in no time that something is wrong and would not hesitate to single out individuals in his annual report or to point out any inappropriate spending .
then we could rub Liberals ' noses in it .
as I said , this is a step forward , but a very tiny step indeed .
the board of directors will include 10 elected members ; 10 western grain producers will sit on the board .
but five other directors , two of whom will be major players , will be appointed by the governor in council .
i take this opportunity to submit to the hon. member for Malpeque , who is running this debate for the government , that the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri - food should be consulted .
i am not asking that it be given a veto , just that it be consulted .
this brings me to the appointments in question .
this morning ' s papers report that the Prime Minister revoked an appointment made by his predecessor , Lester B . Pearson .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
on a point of order .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
i only have two minutes to go .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member for Bourassa .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
Mr. Speaker , I understand that my friend , the member for Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , can get quite worked up - I ' m not sure which hormones are involved - but I think we should stick to the point .
what Canadians want to hear is his position on -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
in the opinion of the Chair , the debate of the hon. member for Frontenac - M 茅 gantic was relevant and we will add that time to the hon. member ' s time .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
Mr. Speaker , I would be grateful if you were to allow me the two minutes I have left .
this morning , the Prime Minister expelled a Liberal senator appointed by Lester B . Pearson .
i will not name him out of respect for his children .
the fellow will earn $ 500,000 for doing nothing .
this is coming out of our pockets .
in my riding , I hear about these appointments all the time .
voters showed Francis Leblanc the door because of the treatment of the unemployed in his riding .
the Minister of Human Resources Development will get him to administer the employment insurance fund .
this did not -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the member for Bourassa on a point of order .
Mr. Denis Coderre :
Mr. Speaker , you know what I am good at .
if you want us to start rhyming off the names of members of the Bloc Quebecois who have demonstrated their incompetence rather than focus on the present debate , that is fine by me .
but the voters in my riding of Bourassa want to know what is going on with this bill and I would ask the member , who is perhaps not often in his riding , to stick to important issues , in this case the Canadian Wheat Board .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
in so far as the government will be appointing members to the board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board , debate concerning the record of the government ' s past appointments to previous boards is relevant .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
Mr. Speaker , you can see as well as I that the rookie member for Bourassa lacks experience and is doing everything he can to distract us , to keep us from criticizing the blunders of the Liberal Party , headed by the member for Saint - Maurice , who can sometimes be inherently devious .
no wonder the government -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
with respect , I think the hon. member for Frontenac - M 茅 gantic has gone a bit too far this time .
with respect , I would ask that his most recent remark concerning the hon. member for Saint - Maurice be withdrawn .
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien :
the member for Saint - Maurice , the Prime Minister , is not inherently devious .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
i am sorry , but the hon. member ' s time has expired .
resuming debate with the hon. member for Simcoe - Grey .
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to address remarks by two members opposite .
first to the hon. member for Brandon - Souris regarding his comments , I found them rather insulting and borderline prejudice .
for him to suggest for one moment that as members of Parliament we are not supposed to deal with national issues , with a $ 6 billion industry that this government backs and because we are from one specific area or another , those comments are nothing more than prejudice .
absolutely unacceptable .
i listened to my Reform colleagues .
i listened to the witnesses and I listened to Conservative colleagues .
what was best for the farmers was inclusion .
that is why it is there , not specific special interests groups that do not necessarily represent certain numbers of farmers .
that is what is best for the farmers .
that is why it stands .
with regard to the member for Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , he should hang his head in shame .
to insult the minister of agriculture completely unacceptable .
to sit here and question the integrity of the prime minister is also unacceptable , likely one of the respected politicians in the entire world and certainly in Canada .
those types of statements are completely unacceptable in this House .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
the minister responsible for the wheat board and the agriculture minister are not here .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member will know we do not refer to the absence or the presence of other hon. members .
the hon. member would also know that is not a point of order .
resuming debate .
Mr. Paul Bonwick :
Mr. Speaker , these types of shenanigans my Reform colleagues are pulling are completely disrespectful of this House .
they too should be completely ashamed of the tactics they use .
they are not only embarrassing themselves but they are embarrassing their constituents .
i suggest they reflect on their actions .
as I mentioned , the comments directed at our minister of agriculture and our prime minister are completely unacceptable .
again , the member should be extremely ashamed of himself .
he was asking some pointed questions with regard to why the minister of agriculture was not overseeing the Canadian Wheat Board discussions , the same questions he asked at committee .
he received completely detailed and very acceptable answers .
then he brings those questions to the House for no more reason than grandstanding and insulting members when he knows they are not here to defend themselves .
the Canadian Wheat Board is good for farmers .
the inclusion clause is good for farmers , despite what these colleagues across the floor are saying .
on that note , I request a answer from the member for Brandon - Souris .
are we not entitled to discuss issues relevant to Canada in an industry which encompasses $ 6 billion dollars or should we just sit here and remain quite ?
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like the hon. member to refer to Hansard because he asked the question -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
with respect , that was a point of debate and perhaps that debate would be best behind the curtains .
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to take part in the next grouping of motions that are before the House this afternoon .
specifically , we are looking at Motions Nos. 2 , 31 and 41 as has already been outlined by previous speakers .
as I listened carefully to the mover of two of those three motions , it was clear that on Motion No. 2 what the mover of the motion is seeking is the ability of a province to opt out of the Canadian Wheat Board .
what is beginning to become clear is now that we are past the words in the preamble , the support by the members in the opposition for the Canadian Wheat Board is like Liberal support on the prairies , a mile wide and an inch deep .
that is particularly true of some of the speeches that have been coming forward .
with respect to Motion No. 2 , clearly what is at play here would be , as the member for Prince George - Peace River pointed out , that a province such as Alberta could opt out .
obviously a move like that would totally cripple the Canadian Wheat Board .
we certainly would oppose any reference to an opting out provision .
it seems to me that some members of this House , in particular members of the Official Opposition , want to eliminate any reference to a contingency fund and so does our caucus , but I think we have different motives in mind .
what is at stake here is to delete any reference to the contingency fund and not to have any borrowing contingencies from the federal government .
in other words , the Canadian Wheat Board would stand or fall on its own .
we are not supportive of that .
we do support the wheat board and recognize that there needs to be government guarantees along this line .
in fact , we want to see the government guarantees be the same as they have always been for the Canadian Wheat Board .
this has not been a big drain on Canadian taxpayers to have had that kind of support .
it seems to us to be a very difficult argument to persuade western Canadian wheat and barley growers that a new , improved wheat board bill is going to be good for them and at the same time have significant increased input costs , costs of production , to maintain the contingency fund .
we tried during committee stage to have some estimate of how big that contingency fund might be .
we never did get a satisfactory response from government officials , although some people have put it as high as $ 575 million .
whether that is 10 % of the value of the Canadian Wheat Board , I do not know where that figure comes from , but it is from usually reliable sources .
we do not know and farmers obviously do not know how big that contingency fund is going to have to be or how much they are going to have to pay for it .
we certainly reject the idea of a contingency fund .
as I said earlier , we would like to see the Government of Canada continue to have the borrowing authority for the Canadian Wheat Board , more correctly , to be able to go through the government for its borrowing requirements on an annual basis .
the Canadian Wheat Board , it seems to me , is a classic example of farmers in this case banding together to create an entity which would allow them to do collectively what they could not do individually or separately .
because there has been a lot of chatter about the history of the wheat board and how it was invoked on an unwilling farm community in western Canada , I would like to quote from an eminent Manitoba historian , Gerald Friesen , who says that Prime Minister Bennett ' s cabinet was under enormous pressure to relieve the burdens of farmers and to judge by the leaders of prairie farm movements , the prairie preference was for a national wheat marketing board .
farmers supported the wheat board in the dirty thirties and they are still supporting it in the nebulous nineties as we saw from the vote last year , to the member from the Reform Party .
sixty - seven per cent , as a matter of fact , of the barley growers voted to have the board continue marketing their crop .
an hon. member :
what do you know about farming ?
Mr. Dick Proctor :
i represent some farmers .
i thought I heard a lot of chatter .
i know the difference between Motion No. 2 and Motion No. 5 .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
Mr. Dick Proctor :
with regard to Motion No. 41 , the Conservatives and the Reform propose to do away with the exclusion clause .
again , we see rugged individualists at work here far more in common with the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange and the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and the National Citizens ' Coalition than with grain farmers .
we think it is a simplistic solution to say that we do not want the inclusion clause , therefore we will take out the exclusion clause as well and we will all live happily ever after .
our preference in this caucus is to give the Canadian Wheat Board both options of exclusion and inclusion clause for the future .
we may all have our views about what the future holds for the Canadian Wheat Board , but no one can say with certainty what it will look like in five or ten years from now .
i think not to give those kinds of options to the board of directors of the future Canadian Wheat Board would be to hamstring it significantly .
in conclusion , it would be a democratic decision , including a vote .
there is certainly nothing wrong with that .
we say that farmers should be allowed to vote on inclusion clause and exclusion clause as the bill currently is , although we will have something to say on deleting a portion of the inclusion clause when we get to that portion of it .
Mr. John Harvard ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to address a couple of points and provide some information that might be helpful as this debate goes forward .
the hon. member from the New Democratic Party who spoke last wondered out loud about the size of the contingency fund .
he intimated that he could not get a proper answer as to how large the contingency fund might be .
it is a reasonable question but I think if people are in possession of the facts , they will understand that the answer to that is that no one really knows exactly how large that fund will be .
it will depend on the decisions made by the board of directors .
members have to remember that 10 of the 15 directors will be elected by farmers .
people from the Reform Party always have real difficulty in listening to facts .
if I could just proceed , the size of the contingency fund will depend on decisions made by the board of directors .
for example , how much use will they make of cash buyouts or the early cash pools ?
it depends on what the board of directors does .
if it does not use those options very often , it could be that the contingency fund will be quite small .
however , it could choose to use the extra tools which we are giving it , the tools which farmers have wanted .
one of the reasons for the bill is to give the farmers and the wheat board more flexibility .
if it chooses to use those options very seldom , chances are the contingency fund will be quite small .
with respect to the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Brandon - Souris , his proposal concerning the contingency fund would rob the board of one more flexible tool .
if we considered his motion , the only way that a contingency fund could be built up would be through the route of check - offs .
the way the bill is written now profits could be used from the sale of bonds , debentures , notes and other financial instruments to credit the contingency fund .
is the Reform Party saying " No , we should not give the board of directors those options .
let us get serious .
surely the board of directors should have as much flexibility as possible .
the hon. member for Brandon - Souris has proposed in his amendment to get rid of the exclusion clause .
what is the exclusion clause about ?
it has the same principle as the inclusion clause .
it sets down a set of rules for orderly procedures .
it does not want any rules or procedures .
the exclusion clause sets out a procedure .
the inclusion clause does exactly the same thing .
the bill is seeking orderliness , a set procedure .
if we talk in those terms to most farmers , they will understand that there is a need for rules so they will know exactly where they stand .
right now , if someone wanted to exclude a grain from the wheat board , what is the rule ?
it is all up in the air .
the bill addresses that issue .
it is the same thing with inclusion .
what rules are there to add a grain to the board ?
there are no rules .
that is what the bill is about .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
Mr. John Harvard :
i know that members of the Reform Party have trouble with facts .
they have trouble with information .
any time we try to bring facts to the debate , what do we hear ?
a whole lot of hollering from a bunch of yahoos .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
Mr. Jim Pankiw ( Saskatoon - Humboldt , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , coming from a bunch of crooks , that is not a bad comment -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , what we are debating now are the amendments in group No. 2 to Bill C - 4 .
the first amendment , as the hon. member for Prince George - Peace River has already pointed out , would take away the power to bind all western provinces to the Canadian Wheat Board monopoly .
Ontario has its own wheat board .
many Albertans , quite frankly , want to have that same type of board .
the board would have a completely elected body and it would give choice to the farmers .
they have to go through the token process of getting a Canadian Wheat Board permit to export but those are granted routinely .
many farmers in Alberta would be very happy to have that kind of situation .
that is the first amendment .
the second amendment which was also put forward by the Reform Party would remove the contingency fund completely from the legislation .
it is difficult to understand why these two motions were grouped together because they do not really relate to each other in any way .
the third amendment in this group was presented by the Conservatives .
it was also presented by Reform .
it would remove the inclusion clause , a clause that would allow the inclusion of grains other than wheat and barley into wheat board jurisdiction .
try to figure how that relates to the other two .
i am very concerned about the groupings .
the fourth amendment in this group would remove the president as an appointed member of the board .
the Freshwater Fish Marketing Board has demonstrated very clearly that we do not want the president appointed by the minister .
the president should be hired and fired by an elected board of directors .
that is the situation we should have within the wheat board .
the Freshwater Fish Marketing Board has a board much like that being proposed under Bill C - 4 with some members being appointed and some being elected .
a situation developed recently in which a former Liberal was appointed as president CEO of the board , much as a Liberal could be appointed as president or CEO of the wheat board when this legislation passes .
in that situation the board was so much against having this person running its marketing board that the board completely removed the power the president would have so the person it wanted to run the board would retain that power .
what those board members did will help them .
at least they will have the person they chose to run the board .
but there will probably be interference from this patronage appointment .
meanwhile the 2,500 fishermen who have their fish marketed through this board are paying for that salary , which is about $ 103,000 , plus all the perks that go with this patronage appointment .
that is the situation in the Freshwater Fish Marketing Board , which is what would happen if the proposed changes in Bill C - 4 go through .
that is the reason we have put forth our amendments in this grouping .
those amendments would at least make the president a position that required hiring by what we want , an elected board of directors .
under this legislation that position requires appointment by the minister .
the legislation also specifies a board with five appointees and ten elected members .
in a nutshell that is what is included in this group .
i will discuss the amendment related to inclusion and exclusion .
the letter failed to mention the various groups that have stated in committee and through letters to the minister that they do not want this inclusion clause in the legislation .
i will go through this list for the members opposite who should know if they have been paying attention to what has been going on with this legislation that in committee these groups have vigorously opposed the inclusion clause .
the first group is the Canadian Canola Growers Association , one of the largest producer groups in Canada .
the second is the Manitoba Canola Growers Association .
these two groups represent thousands of farmers from western Canada who are very happy having canola marketed on a completely open marketing system .
back in the early 1980 s we had a plebiscite on the inclusion of canola into the wheat board and it was defeated by a large margin even back then .
the mood of farmers now certainly is not for more inclusion under wheat board jurisdiction .
if the members opposite on the government side would just look at the polls that have been done , at the surveys that have been done , they would know that the mood in Canada today among western farmers is clearly toward having the monopoly completely removed from the Canadian Wheat Board .
i refer to the plebiscite in Alberta , a plebiscite which I think was well run .
it showed that 62 % of farmers in Alberta preferred a voluntary board or a dual marketing systems in wheat .
sixty - seven percent of farmers in Alberta preferred a voluntary board for the marketing of barley .
the Government of Saskatchewan , which wanted to get the results showing that the monopoly should be retained , found to its shock , even with the poll as it was done , that 57 % of farmers in Saskatchewan were in favour of voluntary marketing .
they were in favour of a voluntary board , a dual marketing system run by the Government of Saskatchewan , even though it wanted a much different result .
that is clear evidence .
in my own constituency of Lakeland I had a professional pollster out of Edmonton , a reputable organization , do a poll and in that poll there were about 700 and some people involved .
we were polling on different issues .
we had a response of somewhere around 250 farmers in that constituency and about 80 % favoured a voluntary marketing system .
i know that in my constituency farmers do not support the inclusion clause .
they do not support this wheat board monopoly in any way .
to finish the list , the Flax Growers Western Canada are strongly against the inclusion clause .
the Oat Producers Association of Alberta , the Alberta Winter Wheat Producers Commission , the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and its members polled do not support this inclusion clause .
the Saskatchewan Canola Growers , the Alberta Canola Producers , the Canadian Oilseed Processors Association , the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange and the Western Canadian Wheat Growers , being one of the larger associations with a completely voluntary membership , which has with it a pretty hefty membership fee -
Mr. John Harvard :
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
that is a point of debate .
Mr. Leon E . Benoit :
Mr. Speaker , I am really quite shocked that these members want to interrupt us at every opportunity they get .
that same Canadian Federation of Agriculture is against this piece of legislation as it is .
it wants some major amendments to this legislation before it will be put in place .
so if the member is going to refer to the Canadian Federation of Agriculture , he had better give the whole story .
it does not support this legislation as it is .
in fact , even the wheat board advisory committee is strongly against .
it said it wants this bill defeated if the parts of the bill that refer to cash purchases are not removed .
it does not even support it , if you can believe it .
in fact , the only witness who supported this bill , and even with amendments or with relatively minor amendments , was the current chief commissioner of the Canadian Wheat Board , Lorne Hehn .
he is the only one .
in committee I asked Chief Commissioner Hehn if he in fact was not in line for an appointment as president , CEO , and he did not deny it .
Mr. Clifford Lincoln ( Lac - Saint - Louis , Lib . ) :
he finds this very funny but I will refer members to section 489 of Beauchesne ' s where " crook " is not accepted as parliamentary language .
i would ask you to ask the member to withdraw , please .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member for Lac - Saint - Louis is quite correct .
the Chair ruled that we had had enough and that we were not going down that road any further .
resuming debate .
Mr. Clifford Lincoln :
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
with respect , I think the House should note that the Chair has a great deal of respect for the hon. member who has just made this point .
however , it is in the Chair ' s opinion that there are no words in and of themselves which are unparliamentary .
it is the context and use of the words which make them unparliamentary .
resuming debate .
Mr. Gilles - A .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to address Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act .
my colleagues in the Bloc and I agree with the government ' s intention to amend this act .
it is interesting to see that , finally , the government seems to want to give more decision making powers to grain producers .
i say seems to want , because the amendments to the act are being made by the government , not by and for the producers .
it would have been in order for the government to first seek a consensus among producers before making these amendments , but it did not do so , if we are to believe what we are hearing in this House .
i will not get into the technical aspects of the act , but I will raise the issues of fairness , honesty and patronage as they relate to the legislation .
i firmly believe , as do the majority of members sitting on this side of the House , that the Auditor General of Canada should have the right and the authority to look into the activities of the Canadian Wheat Board .
i sometimes wonder .
why are they opposed to the auditor general checking into the Bank of Canada ?
why are they opposed to him checking into the Canada Ports Corporation ?
i could go on and on .
these are corporations which are funded by us , the taxpayers .
i have here a few questions .
i also wonder how it is that our friends opposite did not pay attention to the Canadian Wheat Board mini - scandal over the revamping of Churchill Falls .
how is it that our friends opposite turned a deaf ear to the pleas of the mayor of Thunder Bay ?
how is it that the mayor of a city in Ontario is forced to turn to a member from Quebec for support ?
the mayor of Thunder Bay , like all residents of Ontario in the Lake Superior area , is wondering why the federal government invested $ 44.5 million on window dressing in that city .
why did this government ' s Department of Transport give $ 16 million to CN in compensation for selling off the Winnipeg - Churchill Falls section to Omni Tracks , which Omni Tracks operates on Hudson Bay Rails ?
CN received $ 16 million in compensation for this .
why is the Department of Transport investing over $ 14.4 million in a dust control system in the port of Churchill and $ 1.6 million in a system to unload trains ?
this unnecessary spending adds up to almost $ 50 million .
what purpose will it serve ?
instead of grain going to Thunder Bay , across Lake Superior and then up the St. Lawrence to Europe , it will go to Europe through Churchill Falls , a port that is not open 12 months a year .
this change , according to figures provided by the city of Thunder Bay , will send 700,000 tonnes of grain through Churchill Falls instead of through Thunder Bay , which will deprive Thunder Bay of $ 35,750,000 annually .
this pointless spending will cost 12 Thunder Bay employees their jobs .
in addition , this policy will cost Thunder Bay $ 1.7 million in taxes annually .
to put it plainly , the government is robbing Peter to pay Paul .
the experts - not me , but the experts - say that from a common point between Vancouver and Redford , Saskatchewan , and from Redford to Thunder Bay or to a port on the St. Lawrence , the cost per tonne of grain , of wheat shipped , differs -
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point or order .
the hon. member is talking about transportation policy .
what we are dealing with here are the motions in Group No. 2 . The member is not speaking to those motions .
i would request that you ensure he does .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the parliamentary secretary is accurate .
we are speaking to the motions in Group No. 2 and our remarks should pertain to Group No. 2 .
therefore I invite the hon. member to resume debate and ask that his comments be limited to that which is relevant to Group No. 2 .
Mr. Gilles - A .
Mr. Speaker , I understand your concern and your decision that I comment only on Group No. 2 . But seeing how fast the members opposite are moving this debate forward , with their objections , their points of order , etc. , Group No. 5 will only be discussed in two or three years .
pardon me if I go from one group to the other , but I will now move on to Group No. 2 .
as I way saying , it costs $ 76.33 a tonne to ship wheat from Redford to Vancouver .
why not ship the wheat through Thunder Bay and then through the ports in Quebec ?
this makes no sense , I cannot understand it .
i cannot understand it , unless this is part of a certain Plan B to isolate Quebec from Europe .
maybe that is the reason .
i cannot understand it .
i will stop here , even before the minute you gave me is over .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the member for Selkirk - Interlake has a point of order .
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I do not feel the Bloc member is speaking to the matter at hand either .
i would like to have the references to useless Churchill investments and whatnot stricken from the record .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
this is a very complex bill and it is a very wide - ranging debate .
the Chair will allow as much latitude as possible to all hon. members in the debate .
the hon. member for Saint - Eustache - Sainte - Th 茅 r 猫 se has one minute remaining .
Mr. Gilles - A .
Mr. Speaker , I am sorry if I irritated my dear colleague from the Reform Party , but , yesterday , I was looking at Reform Party members performing , and I can tell you that they too were going all over the place .
i am pleased to participate in this debate and to expression my humble point of view .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner ( Portage - Lisgar , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , having had that encouragement I would like to go on the record as saying that transportation probably is a very important part of the bill .
i would like to challenge some of the statements that have been made .
the second grouping suggests that the provinces should be eliminated from making decisions on the Canadian Wheat Board bill and transportation probably has a very big part to play in that regard .
i point that out because during the late 1970 s and 1980 s we moved tremendous amounts of grain to the Soviet Union and other east bloc countries .
we could move it for about $ 30 or $ 40 a tonne cheaper through Churchill .
they even offered to bring in icebreakers to move the grain out of that port .
for some reason there was enough clout either in Ottawa or somewhere else to defer all that grain down the St. Lawrence , which cost us an extra $ 38 a tonne to move .
i cannot comprehend why hon. members would object to that .
Ontario , for example , runs its board completely by itself .
it ships its grain in whatever direction it wants and sells it to whomever it wants .
it seems very strange that the bill would specific that provincial authority or provincial input should be outlawed .
that just does not make sense .
another thing I want to comment on for a few minutes is the contingency fund .
i do not know why farmers would support a bill with this type of fund when they have no actual control over it .
why would we want to put money into a fund that we cannot control ?
that seems to be plainly ridiculous .
they said that it would be from 5 % to 10 % of the gross amount of that cheque .
i do not know if Liberal members have not paid attention to the return on agriculture investment today .
the top investment money one can get from one ' s assets today is probably 1.5 % to 1.75 % .
if the board is to deduct 5 % as a minimum and up to 10 % , farmers will lose money selling their grain .
there is no way to make the contingency fund pay .
why would any farmer be so foolish as to sell his grain in that kind of market ?
it does not make sense .
i cannot understand why a person would want to take money out of his pocket and put it into a fund where the auditor general cannot even look at it to see whether it is invested properly .
a year ago I introduced a private member ' s bill to put the auditor general in control of the wheat board .
every member on that side said no way .
they did not want accountability .
that nice book the hon. parliamentary secretary to the minister of fisheries holds up in the air is a smoke screen .
it is not worth putting a match to it .
if members want to find out why they should look into the elections act to find out how many millions that auditing firm paid to the election fund of the Liberals .
it is very interesting .
i flew back to Ottawa in August to do some work .
i picked up the Hill Times , and what did I see ?
i saw a whole page ad by the Canadian Wheat Board telling western farmers how good it was .
how many western farmers read the Hill Times ?
it cost western farmers $ 3,200 to put that ad in the paper .
can you believe that , Mr. Speaker ?
i cannot believe it .
the Speaker :
well , if you have a tough time believing it , I am sure we would all have a tough time .
it being 2 p.m. , we will now proceed to Statements by Members .
statements BY MEMBERS
AVCORP INDUSTRIES INC.
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , recently my colleague , the Secretary of State for Asia Pacific , announced $ 4.4 million in federal investment in Avcorp Industries Incorporated based in Richmond , B.C. This investment is part of Industry Canada ' s technology partnership program which supports innovation in technology and job creation .
through companies like Avcorp , the government is promoting Canada ' s role as a leader in technology .
as a consequence economic prosperity is being fostered in B.C. and across this country .
the technology partnership program is proof that the government is creating jobs and is taking action to boost our economy in British Columbia .

trade
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , three years ago this government , along with all provinces , signed the agreement on internal trade .
this agreement laid out a framework and timetable for completing the agreement which would remove barriers to trade within Canada .
each province agreed that removing internal trade barriers would benefit that province .
yet this government has done little to complete the agreement .
one deadline after another has been missed .
studies have shown that a 10 % increase in internal trade would create 200,000 jobs and that the removal of trade barriers would increase average family income by $ 3,500 .
this afternoon my Private Members ' Bill which would lead to the completion of this agreement will be debated .
this bill would force the government to complete the agreement in areas where it has the consent of the majority of provinces , including at least 50 % of the population .
the bill is supported by the President of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , the President of the B.C. Chamber of Commerce and a list of others .
this afternoon we will see whether this government has any interest at all in completing the agreement which would do so much for Canadians .
* * *
personal BANKRUPTCIES
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi ( Bramalea - Gore - Malton , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , though Canada is experiencing firm economic growth , personal bankruptcies are at record high levels , reaching 79,631 in 1996 , a 22 per cent increase from 1995 , according to Industry Canada .
it is our duty to ensure that everyone , including women , students and self - employed Canadians , enjoy the benefits of Canada ' s strong economic growth .
one way we can come to the aid of honest Canadians currently facing a growing mountain of personal or small business debt would be to enforce tougher penalties for those who abuse the bankruptcy process .
to that end , the government should consider setting up a special investigation unit to stop such abuses .

AFRICAN INDUSTRIALIZATION DAY
Mrs. Maud Debien ( Laval East , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are celebrating today African industrialization day , as proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly .
in this resolution , the international community commits itself to supporting Africa ' s efforts to achieve faster growth and sustainable human development .
there is still much to be done to eliminate poverty , to promote democracy , to strenghten civil society , to enhance the status of women , to find solutions to the debt problem and to encourage the development of the African economy .
canada ' s efforts in these areas leave much to be desired .
canada ' s contribution to poor countries over the next several years will fall below 0.2 % of GNP .
in 1998 , Canadian international assistance will be at its lowest level since the 1960 s .
the Bloc Quebecois strongly disagrees with Canada ' s withdrawal from poor countries and especially from Africa .
we urge the government to respect its commitment to earmark 0.7 % of its GNP for official development assistance .

diabetes AWARENESS MONTH
Ms. Aileen Carroll ( Barrie - Simcoe - Bradford , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , November is Diabetes Awareness Month .
i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation for its efforts in raising awareness of this disease and for raising $ 3.5 million for diabetes research this past year .
the foundation was founded 23 years ago by parents of children with diabetes who were concerned that not enough research was being done to cure this disease .
since that time the foundation has awarded $ 28 million to research , making it the largest donor to diabetes research of any other health agency .
some of the leading diabetes research still takes place in Canada .
Banting and Best may have discovered insulin in 1921 , but today the work continues at universities in Edmonton , Montreal , Toronto and London .
the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation deserves our support .

festival OF NORTHERN LIGHTS
Mr. Ovid L . Jackson ( Bruce - Grey , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , on November 14 , 1997 Owen Sound ' s Festival of Northern Lights celebrated its tenth anniversary .
from a modest beginning as a display of Christmas lights along the Sydenham River , it has grown to one of the largest tourist attractions in northern Ontario during the holiday season .
the festival now features 170 displays and 11 kilometres of lights trimmed along the Sydenham River from the inner harbour to the heart of the city .
on November 14 over 1,000 people took part in the official opening of the festival .
two of its original architects , Marie and Cecile Walpole , were there to officially turn on the switch .
it was a moving ceremony and a tremendous honour to Ann Kelly and all those volunteers who have made this festival the pride and joy of Bruce - Grey during the festive season .

national CHILD DAY
Mr. Rick Casson ( Lethbridge , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , on this National Child Day I would like to bring attention to the plight of the children in Canada whose parents are finding it difficult to feed and clothe their families , a situation which the government has perpetuated through high taxes .
in many cases the troubles families find themselves in are no fault of their own .
families that work long hours , work more than one job still find that their after - tax income is not enough to properly care for their children .
the average family spends more on taxes than on food , shelter and clothing combined .
this causes a great deal of anxiety and pain to hard working Canadians .
this situation does not need to exist nor should it exist .
when will this government wake up , get its hands out of the pockets of hard working Canadian families and give them their money back ?
through inflated income tax , job killing , high EI premiums and now an almost doubling of CPP premiums , the government continues to take , take , take .
children are living in poverty in Canada because the Liberal government is taxing their families into the poor house .

literacy
Mrs. Rose - Marie Ur ( Lambton - Kent - Middlesex , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , some of us take reading and writing for granted , but for many it is a daily challenge .
Bob Croxford , who resides in Forest , Ontario , had trouble reading a newspaper or directions on a paint can .
but those days are now behind him .
turning to a literacy class at Lambton College in Sarnia , he worked tenaciously on improving his skills .
two years ago he started writing a book .
today in a special ceremony to kick off the Ninth Annual Read Up On It program , Senator Joyce Fairbairn and Mr. Croxford presented his book " The Unknown " to the National Library .
literacy problems affect nearly 40 % of Canadian adults with many living in fear of admitting it .
on behalf of the constituents in Lambton - Kent - Middlesex , we extend congratulations to Bob for providing inspiration to all Canadians .
* * *
minister OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS
Mrs. Francine Lalonde ( Mercier , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said that any unilateral declaration of sovereignty by Quebec would be contrary to Canadian constitutional law and to international law .
is the minister telling us right away that the federal government will refuse to negotiate partnership calmly and serenely , thumbing its nose at the interests of Canadians and Quebeckers alike ?
the wish of the sovereignist movement is clear : to obtain a yes for the sovereignty of Quebec in a democratic manner , along with the mandate to negotiate a partnership with the rest of Canada .
is the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs aware that , in his attempt to put fear into Quebeckers , he is at the same time making clear his disdain for the economic and political interests of Canadians and Quebeckers ?
he would do well to read the statement by the previous Minister of Justice , who called for recognition of the referendum vote and negotiation with a sovereign Quebec .
* * *
national CHILD DAY
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , today is National Child Day , a day to recognize the important role which children play in our lives .
one in five Canadian children live in poverty and many do not receive adequate and nutritious food .
kids who do not get enough to eat are tired , have short attention spans and do not learn to solve problems as well as their classmates .
it is for these reasons that the Canadian Living Foundation established its breakfast for learning program .
since 1992 this remarkable organization has helped over 1,700 community supported nutrition programs across Canada .
to date , over 18 million meals have been provided for kids in need which include the children at Cambridge Street Community School in my riding .
i thank the staff and volunteers at the Canadian Living Foundation breakfast for learning program and I congratulate them on a job well done .
i also encourage our government to make children ' s needs a top priority .
i join with my colleagues in congratulating all those who are celebrating their birthdays today .

criminal CODE
Mr. Gerry Ritz ( Battlefords - Lloydminster , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , a bill has once again been introduced in this House to repeal section 43 of the Criminal Code .
that section admits that parents and guardians may use corporal punishment if the situation warrants .
although opponents of section 43 would have us believe they have the interest of the child at heart , it is our responsibility to examine the motives and logic they bring to this debate .
the United Nations sponsored convention on the rights of the child has been mentioned as a document that prohibits corporal punishment .
our own charter of rights and freedoms has also been mentioned although the reference is less clear .
in either case the intention is to say to parents that special interest groups and politicians who hide behind their self - described expertise are much better qualified to raise your children than you are .
Canadians do not condone family violence but they are sick and tired of hearing the outrageous abuse of facts that come from government subsidized conferences held in foreign countries .
i urge all parents to love their children and to look critically at any statement that begins , the convention -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Churchill .

INDIAN AFFAIRS
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the following are the words of Ila Bussidor :
i dream of an eagle
forever coming to me with messages of strength
always in friendship and kindness .
i touch the great sacred bird of spirit .
he cares for me , each time I vision him .
he lets me carry him .
he gives me his sacred feathers .
he walks with me .
i am not afraid of him .
i believe he is my guardian .
the spirits of my father and mother
beside me in my times of pain .
Ila Bussidor is one of the Sayisi Dene who have survived the tragic cycle of discrimination , poverty and violence that saw the death of one - third of her people , a cycle of destruction that is a direct result of their uprooting by the department of Indian affairs .
night spirits are the spirits of the dead .
i urge the minister of Indian affairs to read this book , to meet with the Sayisi Dene of Tadoule Lake , to work toward compensation for the government ' s actions and to apologize to Ila and her people .
* * *
national CHILD DAY
Mr. St 茅 phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
today we are celebrating the fifth National Child Day .
this day was created in order to commemorate two measures adopted by the United Nations , the Declaration of the Rights of the Child , and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
that convention , which Canada ratified in 1991 , is aimed at ensuring the survival , protection and development of children .
recent statistics show that children under the age of 18 constitute 42 % of those receiving assistance from food banks , and that 20 % of Canada ' s children are poor .
in Canada , and in Quebec , the number of poor children is growing at the same astounding rate as the number of millionaires .
i am therefore inviting the government over there to reflect upon the consequences of the actions it intends to take for future generations .

HENRI - BOURASSA BOULEVARD
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
it was begun in 1994 and tripled the width of the boulevard over a distance of 8.5 kilometres .
funding for this project was provided by the federal and provincial governments and by the municipalities involved , that is , Montreal , Montreal East , Anjou and Montreal North .
as you can see , federal - provincial co - operation can produce worthwhile results and shows once again that federalism works .
this project meets objectives set for the movement of people and goods , and it also provides significant economic support for the industrial development of Montreal ' s east end .
when two governments put their shoulder to the wheel to carry out projects of this size for Quebec , we wonder why political parties are fighting to separate Quebec from Canada or , in other words , we understand why there is no reason for the Bloc to be in Ottawa .
* * *
national CHILD DAY
Ms. Diane St - Jacques ( Shefford , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to draw attention to National Child Day .
today , November 20 , is the day set aside for all children whatever their origin or their nationality and whether they are rich or poor .
today , for 1.5 million Canadian children , or more than one child in four , taking a step in our society where money means happiness brings fresh pain , which , unfortunately , does not go away .
for these children , the ray of hope they have each day as they get up is dashed , as their dreams are often under the shadow of a cloud .
their breakfast is often not enough to satisfy their hunger .
i would remind this House and the Minister of Human Resources Development that these children will be running Canada ' s economy tomorrow .
these children will remember tomorrow what you do for them today .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
canada POST
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , after seven months of collective bargaining at the post office and assurances from the minister that this is the best way to go , what do we have today ?
a strike at Canada Post and a shutdown of mail service right across the country .
we know the minister and the government can be counted on to defend the rights of management in the collective bargaining process .
we know the NDP and the Bloc can be counted on to defend the rights of the union , but we are here to uphold the rights of the long - suffering Canadian public who is sick and tired of strikes at Canada Post .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the parties are talking at this time through negotiations .
under the law of the land , workers have the right to strike and we have to respect that law of this land .
we would not take away the right to strike before a strike occurs .
now we hope that the parties will find a solution .
they were very close a few days ago , and I hope today ' s discussion will bring about a conclusion through these negotiations .
this has always been the position that this government has preferred .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , we support the collective bargaining process , but when it fails the government has an obligation to act .
this government claims to be concerned about the economy .
this strike will cost businesses millions of dollars .
it cripples the direct marketing industry at the worst time of the year .
it hurts the economy .
i ask the Prime Minister , in the name of economic common sense , in the name of fiscal responsibility , how many millions of dollars does the Canadian business community have to lose before the government will legislate workers back ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we have in the laws of Canada a provision that gives these employees the right to strike .
perhaps the opposition party does not want to have the collective bargaining process exist in our nation .
that is fine .
that may be its position , but it is not ours .
we know that when we give the right to strike , the right to strike can be used .
at this moment , I am urging the parties to sit down and find a solution in the interests of all Canadians .
the union has the prerogative to go on strike .
the Speaker :
the hon. Leader of the Opposition .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister upholds the right to strike .
when is he going to uphold the right of the Canadian public to its mail service ?
in Montreal , the Old Brewery mission serving 1,200 meals a day is going to have a mail campaign -
the Speaker :
the hon. Prime Minister .
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , since there was no question , there is no need for an answer .
i said , and I will repeat it , if they want an answer , yes , there is a strike because the Parliament of Canada has given the right to strike to this union .
that is in the law and we have to respect the law of the land by giving the two parties a chance to find a negotiated solution .
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday on CBC TV the Minister of Labour said he would not interfere with postal negotiations because 90 % of all collective bargaining in government sectors is settled without a strike .
that brings Canada Post ' s 10 year average to less than 50 % .
will the minister admit that Canada Post is not one of his success stories and legislate an end to this disruption ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the collective bargaining system has worked well in this country .
as my colleague indicated , over the last year in fact 94.5 % of the businesses under federal jurisdiction have been settled without a work stoppage .
what we want to have here , and what the prime minister has indicated , is to let the process work .
the strike is only a few hours old .
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , if the minister thinks that an average of a strike every two and a half years is a good record , I hate to think what his bad record is .
over 1,000 people in direct marketing were laid off prior to the strike actually starting .
tens of thousands more in direct marketing , charity organizations and businesses that depend on mail in the operation of their business will soon be joining them .
merry Christmas , Canada .
can the minister tell this House how many people need to be laid off and how much suffering they and their families have to go through before he will act ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the people of Canada have little sympathy for a strike or a lockout at any time , particularly this time of year .
what we must do is follow the law .
under Part I of the Canada Labour Code they certainly have rights .
this government is letting the process work .
what I urge my colleague to do is encourage the parties to get to the table , look in the whites of the eyes of each other , come up with a deal , a deal that is better for the people of Canada .
* * *
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , in his report , the director general of elections in Quebec says precisely what the Minister of Canadian Heritage would never admit :
option Canada was indeed a gimmick through which the Council for Canadian Unity could get directly involved in the referendum .
in the light of this damning report , could the Minister of Canadian Heritage stand up and tell us in unequivocal terms what Option Canada did with the $ 4.8 million supposedly spent during the referendum campaign ?
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we did the same thing Mr. Duhaime did with his funds .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Conseil de la souverainet 茅 du Qu 茅 bec headed by Yves Duhaime submitted a report of its activities , thereby clearly acting within the law , while the same can unfortunately not be said of the Minister of Canadian Heritage , who is twisting the facts as she did with the GST .
will the Prime Minister , who is responsible for the integrity of his government , state in this House that Option Canada did not violate in any way the Quebec referendum act , which was in effect at the time of the 1995 referendum ?
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is interesting that the hon. member should mention this act because I think it was declared unconstitutional and that it why there was no follow - up after the referendum .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage .
what distorted logic did the minister use to divert funds from the official languages promotion budget to a phoney organization whose role was to spread federalist propaganda during the last referendum campaign ?
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will simply remind the hon. member and anyone else interested in this issue , that the amount of the funds allocated to Option Canada is exactly the same as the amount given by the Quebec government to Option souverainet 茅 Qu 茅 bec .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , we would like to see the minister table a report that would confirm the transparency of the process , as the Quebec government did in full compliance with the law .
the same cannot be said of her and that is the problem .
the minister once said " If I am accused of fighting for my country , then I plead guilty '' .
in all likelihood , the money given to Option Canada was used to double the budget of the no side , which was in contempt of the Quebec referendum act in effect in 1995 .
are we to understand that , for this government , which has a holier - than - thou attitude and tries to lecture everyone , any -
the Speaker :
the Minister of Canadian Heritage .
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have never made excuses for fighting for my country and I never will .
if the hon. member wants to talk about costs , let us talk about the real costs of the referendum , as reported in Le Soleil on December 2 : " Government advertising aimed at Quebec ' s welfare recipients , $ 273,000 ; unveiling of the preamble at the Grand Th 茅芒 tre de Qu 茅 bec , $ 175,000 ; hiring - '' .

financial INSTITUTIONS
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Prime Minister .
banks have registered record profits over the past five years .
part of the reason for this is the service charges they require their customers to pay .
it is easy for the banks to strangle their customers .
this government does not require them to publish the figures that could explain such charges .
why not set up a parliamentary inquiry to determine how much of these profits were made at the expense of Canadians ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , if banks are making profits , the leader of the NDP can rest assured that we will tax them .
this government , in fact , levied $ 100 million in taxes on banks in its second budget .
this government has taxed major corporations , and this includes major financial institutions .
it is a good thing that the banks are stable , but we are ensuring for Canadian taxpayers that we are getting our share of the pie .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the issue is why banks are making obscene profits while Canadians are paying obscene service charges .
bank service charges are user fees .
they are regressive taxes feeding massive profits and they play a part in preventing over 400,000 low income Canadians from even having a bank account .
will the Minister of Finance introduce legislation requiring financial institutions to provide a lifeline account , assuring basic , affordable financial services to all Canadians ?
hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the banks have already published that and undertaken that in accordance with our instructions to them .
let me quote from a press release of December 4 , 1996 , when the leader of the fourth party said : " We welcome bank profits if they are earned through good management , sound long term investment and progressive participation in the Canadian economy '' .
why is she changing her mind ?

drug PATENTS
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , next Tuesday , in the Town of Fleurimont , a Pharmacology Research Centre will be inaugurated at the University of Sherbrooke .
this project would not have been possible without Bill C - 91 , which was passed in this House .
i would like today to ask the Prime Minister to clarify his government ' s position on this legislation .
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it was rather clear , I think .
we undertook to respect our commitments under international treaties , including with the World Trade Organization and also NAFTA .
we also received a report from a House committee suggesting that we review the regulations .
we are proceeding with this , but we will be maintaining the 20 - year period for patent protection .
hon. Jean J . Charest ( Sherbrooke , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , unfortunately the minister today is confirming the doubts we had , because his answer is unclear .
he speaks of the 20 - year period , but he leaves the door wide open when it comes to the regulations .
the Prime Minister knows how important this bill is for Quebec and for investments .
can the Prime Minister tell us clearly today that he will not be changing the regulations to do through the back door what he cannot do through the front door ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I said clearly that a House committee studied this issue and asked the government to review the regulations .
the legislation requires that we review the regulations in 1997 .
the legislation required that we review the regulations and also the act itself in 1997 .
so we are only doing today what the law as passed requires us to do for 1997 - 98 .

miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
this government writes the law .
it is time that this government wrote some law that is going to help the Canadian public right across the land .
my question is for the labour minister .
why will this government not put its foot down and get legislation in place to get these postal workers back to work now ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , what this government wants is a collective agreement .
it is unfortunate that we continually hear talk of legislation , talk that will do nothing but hurt the negotiations .
both parties are at the table .
let us leave them at the table to see if they can come up with a collective agreement that will be better for the people of Canada .
let us not be making statements that will hurt the negotiations .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , both parties have been at the table for seven months and the strike started yesterday .
this morning the office of the Liberal MP for Leeds - Grenville told a constituent that the government did not want to legislate the workers back because it would hurt the morale of the union members .
let us look at who is hurting here .
the Canadian public is hurting .
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Cardigan , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is unfortunate that they have to continue talking about something that does nothing but hurt the negotiations .
let us be constructive .
we have both sides at the table .
they want to come up with a collective agreement .
let us support both sides in order to come up with an agreement that will be better for CUPW , better for the post office and better for the people of Canada .

QUEBEC ' S PARTITION
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs .
yesterday , the minister said that when it came to the sovereignty of Quebec , they could not exclude the possibility that changing borders is the lesser evil .
this is clearly a statement in support of the proposal to partition a sovereign Quebec .
are we to understand that , by making this statement , the minister is becoming the moral support , the political representative and the chief leader of the partitionist movement in Quebec ?
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is typical of the separatist leaders : when they do not know what to say about something , they try to run down their opponent .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my supplementary is for the Prime Minister .
will the Prime Minister admit that the partitionist movement being led by his minister is rejected by the Quebec people and that his government should dissociate itself for once and for all from this completely irresponsible , not to say outright dangerous , movement ?
right Hon. Jean Chr 茅 tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the people of Quebec have voted twice to remain in Canada .
second , every time the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs writes a letter , the Parti Quebecois , the Government of Quebec and the Bloc Quebecois , being unable to reply in writing , try to insult him .

Mr. Speaker , for seven months this process has been going on and the results have been that there has been not bargaining in earnest but actually depending on the government at some point to legislate them back to work , like it has done time and time again .
when will the minister take some action and restore the postal service ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the only unfortunate thing is that these statements are doing nothing but hurting the process .
my hon. colleague talks about businesses under the federal jurisdiction .
i have indicated before that in the last year of the businesses under the federal jurisdiction , 94.5 % have settled without a dispute .
it is a good system .
the collective bargaining system has served us well in this country for years .
let it work .

the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Michel Guimond ( Beauport - Montmorency - Orl 茅 ans , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
yesterday , in Montreal , the Minister of Transport said that his government intended to become involved in public transportation , which is under provincial jurisdiction , as part of the struggle against greenhouse gases .
before he starts meddling in other people ' s business , why does the minister not give priority to saving VIA Rail , which is dying a slow death because the federal government lacks the courage to act to enable it to develop ?
this is something that is in his bailiwick , let him mind his own business .
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
my goodness , Mr. Speaker , I never thought that one speech in Montreal would excite the hon. member so much .
the fact is the reports of the federal government interfering in provincial jurisdictions in this area are totally wrong .
we have a collaborative approach with the various transport ministries across the country which work very well .
however , there is no denying that there is an urban congestion problem .
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of the Environment .
how does the minister justify the fact that her government is paying out hundreds of millions of dollars directly or indirectly to support the oil industry , when it is throwing only crumbs to support the development of renewable energy ?
hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. gentleman ' s information is factually incorrect .
since the late 1980 s the amount of direct spending by the Government of Canada in relation to the energy sector has dropped dramatically .
in our last two budgets , 1996 and 1997 , we substantially enhanced the amount of resources dedicated to renewable energy , energy efficiency and alternative sources .
the hon. gentleman should catch up with the facts .
* * *
canada POST
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it seems that we are the only party in the House that is concerned about this post office strike .
the minister tells us to have confidence in the collective bargaining process at Canada Post .
that process has led to a strike or a disruption once every two and a half years for the last 10 years .
so I ask the minister again will he acknowledge that the process is broken and legislate those workers back to work ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is most unfortunate that we have to continually talk about something that does nothing but hurt the process .
the member is criticizing a system that has been over 90 % successful in the last year .
the collective bargaining system has served us well over the last many years .
let it work .
let Canada Post and CUPW come up with a collective agreement that will serve Canadians well .
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) :
that is what encourages both sides not to co - operate .
will the minister not acknowledge that the process he is relying upon is broken and do something to fix it and do something today ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this process is under part 1 of the Canada Labour Code .
it has been updated periodically .
the process has served us well for years .
a process that has over a 94 % success rate is not a process that needs to be torn apart and then fixed .
the collective bargaining process has worked well .
please let it work .
* * *
INDIAN AFFAIRS
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development .
many voices have been raised to decry the sad history of residential schools for native peoples , which were set up to break their ancestral culture .
these schools almost wiped out a generation of native people , and the federal government has an enormous responsibility in this sad story .
when and how does the minister plan to publicly apologize to the native communities that were the victims of this tragedy ?
hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the stories of residential schools were explained and described very well in the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples .
it is a commitment of the government to respond to the royal commission as soon as possible , and we will do so .
* * *
international TRADE
Mrs. Karen Redman ( Kitchener Centre , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade .
last week I had the opportunity to participate in the business women ' s trade mission to Washington which involved 120 participants from across the nation .
what action is the government taking following this trade mission to ensure that women are meaningful participants in the export industry of Canada ?
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in thanking the hon. member for her question I should report to the House that she was part of a history making event , the first female entrepreneur trade mission in the history of the country .
i am also pleased to report to the House that the minister announced a women ' s trade summit would be held in Toronto in 1999 . Women are making a great contribution to the economy of the country .
* * *
canada POST
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , low income people , seniors and people who live in rural Canada are the people who depend on Canada Post to stay in touch with their friends and family .
we have an instance of a charity in Montreal that uses Canada Post to do its fund - raising so it can do its good work .
why is the government allowing all these very vulnerable groups and individuals to suffer because of its inaction ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , of course the government is concerned but we must let the process work .
as far as social assistance cheques are concerned they will be delivered by CUPW .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
this strike will cost Canadian businesses about $ 40 million a day .
how can the minister stand there and not do anything at all , knowing that hundreds of thousands , millions of Canadians , will suffer because of its inaction ?
when will the government legislate them back to work ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like these people to realize that we are protecting seniors .
in that way the government has reacted very well .
we have negotiated with Canada Post to deliver employment insurance and social security benefits that Canadians need .
i would like Canadians from coast to coast to know that we have organized the establishment of over 400 distribution sites so that social benefit cheques will be available to them .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , now a question from the only party in the House that sees the workers of CUPW as Canadians .
the current crisis facing Canadians and Canadian businesses is because the Minister of Public Works and Government Services has turned Canada Post into a cash cow with excessive dividends and demands for the government instead of quality postal service for all Canadians .
will the minister advise the House that the government will get its greedy little fingers out of the coffers of Canada Post so that bargaining between the management and CUPW will begin in earnest in an atmosphere of openness and fairness ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , at the moment that we speak and since last night talks have resumed .
canada Post is at the table with the union .
canada Post has a mandate to negotiate .
i am sure that with good will from both parties we will have a negotiated settlement as soon as possible .
* * *
communications
Ms. Wendy Lill ( Dartmouth , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , there is another area in which Canadians are being sidelined for profit .
that is telephone service .
since 1992 some local phone rates have increased by over 100 % .
thousands of homes are without phones because the rates have gone through the roof .
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is a very good question .
i know the member will be aware that Canada currently has the lowest telephone rates in the world both for local and long distance service .
she will also know that we have moved to ensure that basic service is made available .
we have asked the CRTC to ensure that is the case and that it is increasing telephone service across Canada .
Canadians will have access not just to basic telephone service but to the very best services the new technologies have to offer as well , as we become the most connected nation in the world .
* * *
airbus
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday the Ottawa RCMP Association president stated that the Liberal government singled out the police as scapegoats in the Airbus affair .
earlier the government tried to cover its tracks on this Airbus matter by placing a gag order on a golden handshake for former Staff Sergeant Fraser Feigenwald .
the rank and file of the RCMP are not accepting responsibility for political interference in the matter .
my question is for the Prime Minister .
will he live up to his shallow rhetoric on government accountability and tell the House once and for all who is responsible for this mess ?
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we have been through this many , many times .
the fact of the matter is that an investigation was done , hearings commenced , the Staff Sergeant resigned , and they stopped .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have repeatedly quoted from a document signed by Brian Mulroney as a means to protest their innocence .
how does the Prime Minister reconcile this fact with the fact that we have another letter charging that an innocent man has done something in a foreign land ?
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am deeply concerned at the suggestion the hon. member has just made .
it seems to me he is suggesting that the government interfere with an ongoing police investigation .
i would think that hon. member would be the first to complain if we were to do so .
* * *
francophonie SUMMIT
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister for International Cooperation and Minister responsible for Francophonie .
the Francophonie summit was held at Hanoi this past November 14 through 16 .
could the minister tell us how the summit turned out and if Canada attained its objectives ?
hon. Diane Marleau ( Minister for International Cooperation and Minister responsible for Francophonie , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to inform this House that Canada attained all of its objectives at the Francophonie summit in Hanoi .
most particularly , Moncton was selected to host the 1999 summit .
the Francophonie has elected its first Secretary General , Mr. Boutros Boutros - Ghali .
under the leadership of the Prime Minister , we succeeded in advancing the Francophonie in a number of areas , particularly the information highway , the permanent international criminal court and human rights .

canada POST
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have a little collective bargaining lesson for the Minister of Labour .
collective bargaining has four parts : negotiate , conciliate , mediate and a settlement mechanism .
canada Post and CUPW do not have a settlement mechanism ; they have a confrontation system .
when will the minister put a settlement mechanism in place and stop holding Canadians to ransom ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as Minister of Labour I am trying not to come up with statements that will harm the discussions between CUPW and the post office .
i want to see a collective agreement .
let the parties sit down and come up with an agreement that will be better for all Canadians : a Canadian solution to a Canadian problem .
* * *
railway TRANSPORTATION
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅 ( L 茅 vis , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
when I met with executives of Via Rail on November 10 , they confirmed their intention of having the Oc 茅 an and Chaleur trains back up under the Quebec bridge all the way to Sainte - Foy .
does the Minister of Transport find this a safe solution , and what does he intend to do with the L 茅 vis station ?
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as I have already stated in this House , no decision has been taken on rail service at the L 茅 vis station in the hon. member ' s region .
i must , however , inform the hon. member that Via Rail has asked CN to defer the decision until January 13 , in order to make holiday season travel easier for everyone .
* * *
ports
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
yesterday I asked the Minister of Transport what he knew about a complaint laid with the RCMP about alleged wrongdoings by Canada Ports police officials .
the minister told the House that he understood the investigation was under way and he could not comment further .
outside the House the minister changed his tune and said the RCMP were evaluating the complaint to decide whether or not to launch an investigation .
still later , an RCMP spokesperson in Halifax said that the force was assessing the nature of the complaint .
is there an investigation under way or not and , if not , why not ?
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have been quite consistent .
they are evaluating that particular complaint and will decide whether or not to investigate .
* * *
export DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , at a foreign affairs committee meeting earlier this month the president of the Export Development Corporation , Ian Gillespie , confirmed that the EDC was reluctant to sign a code of ethics championed earlier this year by the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
how could the Canadian government ask Canadian corporations to sign this code of ethics when crown agencies are unwilling to sign the code of ethics and play by the same rules ?
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
i will take it under advisement and report back to him .
* * *
CANADIAN HERITAGE
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , a recent survey found that nearly one in two Canadians would fail the citizenship examination given to immigrants .
this suggests that a large number of Canadians lack the basic civic knowledge required to understand and participate in Canada ' s public life .
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage .
what role does she think the federal government should play to ensure that history and civics are taught in schools across Canada ?
does she think that the federal government should develop national standards in these areas ?
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for Waterloo - Wellington for his question .
i know that in his past life he had a particular interest in heritage .
the statistics he quoted are of concern to all of us .
that is why at the last meeting of federal - provincial ministers of culture we agreed to establish a pilot program with the Canadian Council of Ministers of Education at its request because it said that we needed more material to teach Canadian about our own history .
* * *
canada POST
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , a million Canadians who want jobs cannot find them .
millions of others who have jobs basically have not had a pay increase in years .
meanwhile Canada Post has guaranteed lifetime employment to its 45,000 unionized members and offered them a 3 % pay increase over two years .
this strike will cost Canadians millions of dollars .
is this what the government and the Minister of Labour call fair ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , what the government calls fair is the collective bargaining system .
let the collective bargaining system work .
let the people in CUPW and the post office sit down and come up with an agreement that will be better for the people of Canada .
* * *
seal HUNTING
Mr. Yvan Bernier ( Bonaventure - Gasp 茅 - 脦 les - de - la - Madeleine - Pabok , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans .
the opponents of seal hunting are currently running ads in which hunters are seen performing unspeakable acts on these animals .
there are two possibilities : either this is fake footage , in which case it needs to be denounced for what it is , or these acts really were committed , in which case the perpetrators need to be prosecuted .
can the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans make a commitment to initiate an investigation in order to inform this House as to whether seal hunting is indeed being carried out in accordance with the standards and the law ?
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , clearly the seal hunt is being directed according to law .
the facts are that the total allowable catch for last year was not met .
there were 261 , 354 harp seals caught and 7,058 hooded seals .
we can assure the member that DFO is doing all it can to see there is no illegal seal hunt .
* * *
health
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) :
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wish the hon. member would confine herself to the facts when she speaks about the safety of children .
it is not fair to children or their parents to create misimpressions about these things .
we recently received and looked carefully at data about the safety of toys .
we satisfied ourselves that all the toys tested had levels of materials that did not pose a threat to the safety of children .
* * *
canada POST
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) :
yesterday the government ran out of time and now it is clear that it is out of ideas .
does the government have any clue how it will end the postal strike , or will it leave Canadians wishing that they had thrown the government out of office ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , again what we must do in this country is let the collective bargaining system work .
the collective bargaining system has served workers and management well .
let the people of CUPW and the post office sit down and come up with a collective agreement that will be better for all Canadians .

DAVID GUSSOW
the Speaker :
my colleagues , today is rather a special day for one of our table officers .
today is the last day David Gussow , Deputy Principal Clerk in Procedural Services , will act as table officer .
David will be leaving this week to take his well earned retirement after 25 years of devoted service on Parliament Hill .
he began his career at the Library of Parliament in 1972 and he went on to work in various capacities in the House , becoming a table officer here with us in 1990 .
i know , my colleagues , that you would like to join with me in recognizing David ' s long and successful career .
i want to wish you , David , your wife Margaret and your two children good health and much happiness in the years to come .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .

privilege
comments DURING QUESTION PERIOD
Mr. Joe Jordan ( Leeds - Grenville , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of personal privilege .
i must say that in between the tributes that we are about to pay I am troubled that I should even have to say this because this is a very honourable place in which we work , and I think everybody realizes that .
during question period the member for Edmonton North saw fit to refer to some sort of clandestine operation she undertook and then alluded to comments that one of the people who worked on my staff said .
that person is not here to defend themselves .
i fall short of saying that this is McCarthyism but -
the Speaker :
this is surely not a point of privilege .
we have one member saying one thing which is perhaps a point of view , an interpretation of the facts .
we have another member who I think was going to say that this did not take place .
if that is the case , then we have a matter of dispute of the facts .
i would hope that this type of thing would not occur , but it is not a question of privilege .
it is a point of information , surely , that he wants to pass on .
the point is well taken by the House .

business OF THE HOUSE
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to get the government House leader to provide the House with some information about the legislation that is coming forward in the House for the remainder of this week and for the balance of next week .
more specifically , I would also like him to let the House know how many days are planned for the debate on Bill C - 2 , the Canada pension bill .
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , let me begin by thanking the House leaders of all parties for their co - operation in trying to arrange what I believe to be so far an orderly program for this House .
that program calls for the business for the next week as follows .
tomorrow morning we will deal with second reading of Bill C - 17 , respecting Teleglobe .
in the afternoon I understand that there is agreement to deal with the report stage and third reading of Bill C - 7 regarding the Saguenay park .
on Monday I understand that there is also agreement to deal with all stages of the legislation on land mines that was introduced earlier today .
it is also my understanding that the House may sit into the evening to complete the said bill .
Tuesday shall be the final allotted day in the present period with votes on main and supplementary estimates and on the consequent appropriation bill or bills at the end of the day .
i am pleased to respond as well on Bill C - 2 .
next Wednesday and Thursday it is our intention to consider the report stage of Bill C - 2 respecting the Canada pension plan .
next Friday we will consider the report stage and third reading of Bill C - 10 , respecting certain international tax conventions .
this is the business statement at least as can be determined at the present time .

the LATE ROBERT THOMPSON
the Speaker :
my colleagues , we will now proceed to tributes to Mr. Thompson , who was with us .
he was a member of the Social Credit Party and also a member of the Conservative Party .
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Robert Thompson who came to this House in 1962 to represent his constituents of Red Deer , Alberta and to lead the Social Credit Party at a time of great political change .
he served in the House from 1962 until 1972 , a decade .
what a decade in political life .
in those ten years there were five general elections .
the Social Credit Party which Bob Thompson led in 1962 was a power to be reckoned with in the west and in Quebec .
press accounts of the day paint a picture of a new leader and a new party running against the establishment .
Bob Thompson served his country in Parliament and also in the Royal Canadian Air Force when Canada was engaged in pilot training during World War II.
he served humanity as an educator here and in Ethiopia .
he was a minister of education in the imperial Ethiopian government from 1947 until 1951 .
after his political life , he maintained his interest in teaching and public affairs .
in 1982 he prepared a model constitution for Canada .
his strong religious faith is reflected in his coat of arms , the motto being translated " In the will of God '' .
Mr. Thompson was made an officer of the Order of Canada in national recognition of his service .
his eight children and his widow Evelyn had less of his presence and time because of his public service .
today we mourn him , we honour his memory and we thank his family for sharing him with this House and with Canada .
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is with regret that we learned of the passing of Bob Thompson .
his career was rich and varied in service to others .
Bob taught school in Alberta before the war .
he was an officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force .
he went to Ethiopia in 1943 both as a teacher and as an air force officer .
during the forties and fifties he served with distinction as an educator in Ethiopia and in the Sudan before returning to enter public life in Canada .
he was the national leader of the Social Credit Party from 1961 to 1967 and was elected an MP for Red Deer in 1962 , 1963 , 1965 and 1968 .
when he retired from Parliament in 1972 , he resumed his career as a university teacher and administrator and completed his public service as a member of the parole board .
i served in this House of Commons with Bob throughout his parliamentary career .
i recall him as a man of substance and integrity .
he was at the centre of events at a time of unusual political tumult .
but even those of us with greatly differing political points of view came to respect and admire him for his sincerity and his personal high standards of parliamentary conduct .
i think it is fair to say that despite what a distinguished Canadian author called the distemper of the times , Bob Thompson was a leading parliamentarian without personal enemies .
he made a strong contribution to this House and to Canada .
therefore I wish to extend our sincere condolences to his widow Evelyn and to his family .
Bob will certainly be missed in terms of service to Canada .
once again , our sympathy to his widow and his family .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on behalf of the official opposition to pay tribute to an amazing Canadian today .
Robert Norman Thompson gave his life to public service in teaching , missionary work , elected political life and as a roaming emissary , specifically in Ethiopia .
Bob was active as a very young man in the Social Credit movement in Alberta .
he honed his political skills at the feet of William Aberhart .
this would stand him in good stead for his entire lifetime .
Bob , his wife Hazel and their children served in Ethiopia for years as missionaries .
Bob was a teacher who organized and helped set up the modern education system there .
he organized an air force training school and was the head of a leprosy mission , among other things .
Bob got things done .
when he arrived back in Canada , Bob took over the leadership of the federal Socred Party in 1961 and , as has been mentioned , he was elected to Parliament for Red Deer in 1962 and re - elected in 1963 and 1965 .
he then ran as a Conservative and was re - elected in 1968 .
in 1972 Bob left politics and moved out to the west coast .
he helped found Trinity Western University in Langley , B.C. He taught political science there and sponsored many Ethiopian students over the years .
it was at Trinity that I met Bob Thompson in the mid - 1970 s .
one strong memory I have of him was when I was involved in a terrible accident with the Trinity van .
when I was elected to this Parliament in 1989 , Bob became an instant adviser .
how I appreciated him as a mentor .
i mentioned the other day that Bob was fast , feisty and a fierce competitor when it came to political debate .
we had some wild and exciting political discussions which taught me a lot .
he was a wonderful role model to me and I appreciated that .
after Bob ' s wife Hazel passed away , he married a long time friend and fellow missionary , Evelyn Brant , in 1993 . Lew and I also married in 1993 , so we considered ourselves the twin couples .
Lew and I quickly fell in love with Evelyn and all enjoyed every chance we could get to have a visit when we were out in the Vancouver area .
just this past summer we enjoyed a wonderful visit , complete with Bob ' s giving me advice about my new position as a member of Her Majesty ' s Loyal Opposition .
it is a special memory that I will always treasure .
the world is a better place because Bob Thompson was in it .
thank you , Bob , for all you gave us .
thank you , Evelyn , and all Bob ' s children for sharing him with us .
bless you all .
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond - Guiral ( Laval Centre , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , both personally and on behalf of my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois , I would like to offer my most sincere condolences to the family of Robert Thompson , who passed away on November 16 .
Mr. Thompson was born in Duluth , Minnesota .
after World War II , he was involved in the reconstruction of Ethiopia , holding a number of senior positions within the Ethiopian government .
he earned particular renown as the director of the Ethiopian Air Force Academy , and subsequently as the deputy minister of education , a position he held for 16 years .
that same year marked his first election to the House of Commons .
he was to represent the people of Red Deer for 10 years , first as a Social Credit MP from 1962 to 1967 , and then as a Conservative from 1968 to 1972 .
once he left politics , Mr. Thompson moved on to a distinguished career as a professor of political science and vice - chairman of the board of governors of Trinity - Western University .
in 1975 he was appointed Canadian High Commissioner to Singapore .
we parliamentarians realize full well how demanding political life is , and what commitment and generosity it demands .
for this reason , we must pay particular tribute to the professionalism and devotion shown by Mr. Thompson throughout his entire political career .
his family and friends have every reason to be proud of him and of all his accomplishments .
hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I do want to add the voice of the New Democratic Party to those of others in expressing our sadness at the loss of Mr. Bob Thompson .
when I was first elected to Parliament in 1968 he was a member of the Conservative Party , actually sitting in the House roughly where the Conservative Party sits today .
i remember speaking to him .
i was only 22 years old and he was one of the more seasoned veterans , what I considered to be a very older person in those days , although he was probably only in his fifties at the time .
he certainly was a very wise and honourable member of the House and I really appreciated him very much .
he was very unique in many ways .
first , he was a teacher , but he was also a chiropractor , a combination we do not see very often .
he was a flight lieutenant in World War II with the Royal Canadian Air Force and then , as members have heard , he became involved in Ethiopia where he spent many , many years involved in education and in government .
he was also very unique because he was the Minister of Education for Ethiopia and later on , of course , a Canadian member of Parliament .
those are a couple of unique combinations and very rare indeed .
he was a very interesting man .
he returned to his country in 1960 , I believe , and became President of the National Social Credit Party .
that was an interesting time because the Social Credit Party had been wiped out in 1958 , the CCF was down to eight seats at that time and both parties were in the process of rebuilding .
the Social Credit Party did rebuild , came back with a stunning 30 seats in the House , with 26 from Quebec led by the deputy leader R 茅 al Caouette , who later split away and formed the Ralliement des cr 茅 ditistes .
Mr. Thompson persevered and stayed on and ran again in 1963 and in 1965 and was re - elected as a member of the Social Credit Party .
if my understanding is correct , he did not like the direction that his party was taking or the configuration of the party after the split with the cr 茅 ditistes .
he switched parties in 1968 and ran as a member of the Conservative Party in the same riding of Red Deer and , of course , was re - elected .
our party differed on many of the ideas and philosophies that Mr. Thompson held , but we respected him as a very honourable man who made a great contribution to the House and to this country .
i think we can learn a lot from his legacy .
with all sincerity , I wish to convey my condolences and the condolences of the New Democratic Party to his wife Evelyn , his eight children , to his many grandchildren and great grandchildren and his friends .
this country will surely miss him .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
the deputy leader of today ' s Reform Party , my colleague from Edmonton North , was indeed one of the people influenced by Bob Thompson .
very few people have influenced our nation in so many ways as Bob Thompson has .
how was it possible for one person to be an officer during the Second World War , a federal member of Parliament , the organizer of Ethiopia ' s boy scout group , a school principal , a deputy minister of education , a leader of a federal political party , chairman of the board of governors of a university , founder of a school for dyslexic children in my riding , an author , and on and on and on his influence goes .
yet , through all of that , he devoted much of his time to his family , his friends , his community .
his influence on me was significant .
Bob often shared his vast experiences with me even when I was a rookie candidate .
he advised me , he informed me when I was on the wrong path and as recently as a couple of months ago , he summoned me to discuss my position and responsibilities as opposition house leader and how to deal with the complexities of the unity issue .
i was proud to be asked to speak with him .
he was a sincere , knowledgeable and wise visionary .
as for me , I shall miss the greatest political mentor of my life .
thank you , Bob Thompson .
government ORDERS
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT
the House resumed consideration of Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts , as reported ( with amendment ) from the committee ; and Motions Nos. 2 , 31 and 41 .
the Deputy Speaker :
the hon. member for Portage - Lisgar has four minutes remaining in his intervention .
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner ( Portage - Lisgar , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to take the last four minutes and address the issue of exclusion costs .
the hon. member for Brandon - Souris moved this amendment to exclude both the inclusion and the exclusion clause .
you would wonder why this clause became an issue .
we were dealing more or less with the exclusion clause in Bill C - 72 and we did not hear too many complaints about the exclusion clause until an ill wind from the east brought up the idea of an inclusion clause .
we found out very quickly that this inclusion clause that was proposed for C - 72 would create a lot of problems .
now we see what this has really done .
the member for Brandon - Souris , and I think rightly so , has made an amendment to exclude both .
when we looked at the commodity groups or had them before as witnesses , they were dead set against this inclusion clause because their farmers that control the commodity groups would have nothing to do with the inclusion clause .
i was somewhat surprised why they were so hesitant or why they objected the most to this clause .
they explained to me that with the exclusion of the special crops from the wheat board , the commodity groups controlled completely the buying of the grain , the moving of the grain and the transporting of the grain across the ocean .
when customers want to buy some of the special crops like canola , sunflowers , canary seeds , they buy it on the basis that it is delivered right to their plants .
that relieves a lot of headaches for them .
they demand delivery .
when they buy a product , that product better be delivered on time or else there are huge fines or huge discounts .
the companies that control these special crops have a tremendous record of getting that crop to the destination .
this has always been the problem of the wheat board grains .
we do not want to just blame the board for some of these problems but the board grains are always on the basis f . o . b . Vancouver , Thunder Bay or Montreal and that is where it stops .
after that , it is up to the customers to try to find transportation to organize it , to bring that product to their plants or to their processors .
this has become a real issue as far as the Canadian Wheat Board grains are concerned , the delivery of those board grains .
customers demand that they have delivery on time because it offsets their production times .
it offsets the commitments they have made to the finished end users of their products .
i think this clause has to be removed .
if it takes the exclusion clause to go along with the inclusion clause , that has to be supported by this House no matter what because we do not want to ruin or hamper the special crops industries which have really been the survival of western farmers in the last decade or two .
if we should take away the special crops , farmers would all be bankrupt today and they would not be able to survive on just the wheat board grains .
it is sometimes hard to believe the issues that arise when some of these bills or amendments are dealt with .
it has made me a little wiser as far as the transportation of special crops is concerned .
i think we have to do everything humanly possible to either amend this bill to a point where it is acceptable by farmers or completely table it and forget about it until some other government will take the bull by the horns and give western farmers what they want , a choice that will make the system work .
as one of the Liberal members asked , how can we fix this inclusion and exclusion clause issue ?
it is very simple .
all we have to do is make the Canadian Wheat Board a voluntary institution and all these problems will be resolved by themselves .
farmers will take their product to the place where it is shipped , where it brings the best price , where it is delivered to the customers because they want to produce a product that is used and has benefited other countries as well as our own .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz ( Yorkton - Melville , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to propose a lawyer board at this time .
rather than a wheat board , I think we should have a lawyer board in Canada .
all lawyers ' services should be marketed through a central agency and this central agency should have its contracts approved by government .
it should apply only to the lawyers in Ontario and Quebec and these lawyers should not be paid directly .
all earnings should go through a central fund .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i do not believe this member is talking about the motion before us .
maybe he is proposing a new agency that the Reform Party might support , but we are really talking about the Canadian Wheat Board here and how to maximize returns back to primary producers .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
the Deputy Speaker :
order , please .
i noticed that the hon. member for Yorkton - Melville in his remarks did not seem to have ones that were immediately relevant to the bill , but I assumed that he was going to draw a parallel between the board he was discussing and the bill before us and indeed the clauses that we are currently debating in Group No. 2 . I know the hon. member will do that soon so that it will be clear to all hon. members that he is on topic .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz :
Mr. Speaker , anybody who was in this House for the last two days would know the relevance of what I am saying .
we are discussing the Group No. 2 amendments which apply to only three provinces .
they are very undemocratic .
they control only farmers .
i am drawing an analogy and I am going to continue .
it would prevent lawyers from making certain contracts because the lawyer may make too much money .
the board should not , however , be allowed to be audited by the auditor general .
if the funds are not being properly managed that should not become public .
how many lawyers would protest would not matter .
they would be forced to pool all their returns and distribute them equitably , except for those who could maybe manipulate the system and get outside it .
he would be kept there for five months even if it meant changing the law within an hour .
lawyers would be limited on where they could deliver their services .
lawyers would have quotas , limits on how many clients they could have .
if after 50 years of this lawyer board they thought it was an undemocratic lawyer board and the government felt some pressure to change it , the government could come up with a question that would have a predetermined outcome to keep control over lawyers by the board and the government .
what do we think lawyers would say ?
lawyers would probably say yes .
then the government would come around and say that means they want to have a lawyer board .
that is how fair the question was that the government asked .
why does it not pick lawyers .
why does it not start having a lawyer board and put control on them ?
there is something very seriously wrong here .
i am very concerned about this issue .
i have worked on it .
this morning I asked a Liberal member to table a piece of paper .
i do not have it yet .
i happen to know what is on it in any event , or I would not have asked for it .
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , that item was tabled this morning .
maybe the hon. member was not in the House .
the Deputy Speaker :
i think the parliamentary secretary is indicating that the document was tabled .
the hon. member can continue his speech .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz :
Mr. Speaker , the member is just trying to interrupt me .
i hope I get some extra time .
i was here when it was tabled .
in any event the point I am trying to make in relation to all this is that it is not fair .
it is as simple as that .
do you get the point I am trying to make , Mr. Speaker ?
it is undemocratic .
it is not fair .
that is the point we are trying to make .
i listened to my Bloc colleague this morning .
he began by saying he supported Bill C - 4 .
i thought everything they are saying contradicts the fact that they are supporting Bill C - 4 , very flawed legislation .
i began to ask myself why they were supporting Bill C - 4 .
could it be that it continues to guarantee the Canadian Wheat Board can determine that grain from the prairies will be shipped through the sea ports of Baie Comeau or Montreal rather than through the port of preference for the people in my constituency , that being Churchill ?
would he agree with a board controlled by the federal government that shipped products from Quebec through the prairies ?
i do not think he would agree with that any more than lawyers would agree to a lawyer ' s board .
nor would the Bloc want to have all of their products shipped through the prairies if that were not cost effective .
farmers in my area want more grain shipped from Churchill .
because it costs less , they would be able to put more money in their own pockets .
however , the Canadian Wheat Board controls their wheat and barley and the route by which it will be shipped .
i have something else to reply to from this morning .
i was shut down by the Speaker but I think it needs to be mentioned .
the member said that we were insulting the House by raising some of the points we have in relation to government controlling this and all that .
do members know the biggest insult ?
the people in my riding are saying it .
it is not that we rise on points of order and that the minister does not have courtesy .
one of the greatest insults to the House is that the government is not listening .
we have not had the minister responsible for the wheat board here one minute yet .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz :
i am sorry , Mr. Speaker .
i apologize .
the Deputy Speaker :
i know the hon. member is interested in the attendance of all members of the House , but he also knows that it is quite improper in debate to refer to the presence or absence of members in the House .
i know he would not want to breach the rules .
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz :
anyway , what is the bottom line on Bill C - 4 , the Canadian Wheat Board bill we have before us ?
the bottom line is that it does not solve the problems with the Canadian Wheat Board .
none of the proposals that have been brought in address the division , the problems or the big issues that concern farmers .
should the Canadian Wheat Board have the exclusive jurisdiction over grains like wheat and barley ?
farmers want control over their property .
how does the bill diffuse the division that exists ?
not one speaker on the Liberal side has addressed that serious problem .
it does not in fact .
without their help we cannot get rid of this discriminatory legislation .
if I lived in Quebec and hollered " separation " if you did not pay attention to what I want , I would probably get some attention .
surely to goodness we can have some fairness in the country .
if I was an aboriginal and I wanted to suddenly export all my grain , would the government suddenly listen ?
the bottom line is that it is not fair .
i showed the certificate earlier .
because of the inaction of the government the Canadian Wheat Board will be destroyed .
it is because the government has not addressed the serious problems that exist .
" property rights will be the focal point of the challenge .
however discrimination may prove to be the trump card '' , this person says .
this will be a very important case with regard to property rights in Canada .
the bill of rights , United Nations conventions , common law and international investment agreements concerning this issue all address property rights .
if we do not look at the amendments that the Reform Party is putting forward we will lose our wheat board for those who truly want it as a marketing agency .
there should be some concern about that .
i one to talk about process .
we were assured there would be many witnesses and those witnesses would be listened to .
it is a slam in the face to democracy .
it is important to listen to the witnesses and not simply to go through the formality .
listening means that we hear what is being said .
the parliamentary secretary to the fisheries minister sits here casting cat calls with a smirk on his face but not hearing what we are saying .
that concerns me greatly .
if the board were to become more accountable it might change the way it operates .
we are asking for that .
producers want to be assured that will happen .
i have many other remarks but I will have to wait to finish .
Mr. Antoine Dub 茅 ( L 茅 vis , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Reform member said that the government party is not listening , and he is right .
this government is truly not good at listening .
however , the member who just spoke does not seem to be terribly good at listening himself , because the Bloc Quebecois members who spoke before me all said we were opposed to the bill .
for at least two minutes , he got some mileage out of Quebec and the Bloc Quebecois by saying we were in favour of the bill , but that is not the case .
the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill .
on initial examination , certain provisions are interesting , but they do not go far enough .
there is mention of greater participation by representatives of agricultural producers , of wheat or grain producers sitting on the board of directors .
here I agree with the Reform Party member that the federal government is retaining too much authority over the administration of the Canadian Wheat Board .
in the end , the only opportunity for industry representatives , for producers , to manage the board is symbolic and somewhat meaningless .
i repeat , that is the position of the Reform Party , and on this point we are in agreement .
that is why , when it comes to the Canadian Wheat Board , we would not necessarily want to stand in the way of others , but this is not yet an issue that concerns us greatly .
we do not produce enough grain crops to be able to export .
what the Reform Party and other parties are saying is that the current situation , even if it remains unchanged in the bill , means we are not creating a large enough contingency fund for the Canadian Wheat Board .
when a problem arises , who pays up ?
the government and thus all Canadian taxpayers .
as we are still in a federal system and as Quebec represents 24 % of the population , it means that each time the Canadian Wheat Board has to pay out subsidies , the shortfall will have to be made up .
the situation is the same as in the case of the famous harmonized GST in the maritimes , where Quebec has received no compensation and has to pay its share to help the maritimes harmonize their tax .
it is the same situation .
i know that the Minister of Human Resources Development , who wants to make known his presence in the House , is trying to question me , but he is also distracting me .
this is why we in the Bloc Quebecois oppose the bill and I have a hard time understanding - and this is my closing point - all the arguments of the Reform members , or at least those of the last one to speak .
he gave the House the impression that we support this bill , when we oppose to it .
is it a problem of language ?
perhaps , but regardless , I want to dispel the misunderstanding immediately .
we oppose the bill .
i would just like to comment on something he said .
i found it - I was going to say in poor taste - let us say unpleasant .
it is as if he were saying that the Liberal government opposite did not listen to the people in his province or to those in the two other western provinces .
he said " Yes , but if I were in Quebec , this government would certainly listen to me '' .
he is wrong there , because one of the problems Quebeckers face with the federal government and the federal system is they are not paid enough attention .
if he thinks he is not paid as much attention as we are , there is a serious problem , because we have a very hard time getting Quebec ' s point across in the House .
in several the standing committees , we have a hard time getting documents in French .
this morning , we spent an hour explaining that the French version of a clause did not say the same thing as the English .
understanding requires two or three mental states : openness , receptiveness and a willingness to be convinced .
without these , a debate becomes a monologue and not a dialogue .
i will have the opportunity to talk about other groups of motions on the subject of this bill , because it covers a variety of aspects .
i will draw on my experience as assistant to Jean Garon , who was the Quebec minister of agriculture at one point in time .
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris - Moose Mountain , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to clarify one important thing for my colleague who who has just spoken .
the Canadian Wheat Board and the movement and selling of grain has never been subsidized , never since the beginning of the Canadian Wheat Board .
the contingency fund is not a subsidy fund .
it is a fund that the western Canadian farmer eventually pays if he does not pay it up front .
i want to make that clear .
when I began my study of this , I went back and read two very important books on the history and origin of the Canadian Wheat Board .
depending on the history book , the origin of the board and the purpose for its beginning are dubious .
but this is 1997 and we are soon going into a new year , soon going into a new century and we are still trying to move grain under a board which is completely out of date .
today there is a whole new generation of farmers .
these young people do not have just $ 20,000 invested .
many of them have $ 3 million and $ 4 million invested .
they know what is going on in the country and what is taking place with sales around the world .
they know when the Canadian Wheat Board is selling grain .
they know that they are being taken .
i want to say that all but two letters that have crossed my desk have stated that people are very afraid of this new bill .
why are they afraid ?
it is because of the inclusion clause .
western Canadians are afraid of the inclusion clause .
some may argue that if they want in or out , they have to have the same regulations .
they got out of the business of growing wheat for the simple reason that they did not want to be mastered by a wheat board which was made in Ottawa , not made in western Canada .
it is a real fear that they have .
the real fear of the young person who is coming on is what they are doing in the way of specialty crops such as the canola crop flats and so on .
some dingbat of an organization is going to give them the idea , let us include it and put it to some phoney vote , and I want to say phoney .
every person in western Canada would tell you that the latest vote was a phoney .
it was phoney because it was an all or nothing at all vote .
while those people will tell you that it was a major victory for the wheat board , it was a major disgrace for the wheat board .
they are going to kill themselves .
do not blame the Reform Party for that .
blame nobody but yourself .
we are the new era of transportation .
we have huge boats that come in the harbour of Prince Rupert .
most important , western Canada should now have the right to dictate where its grain is going and to what transport facility .
whatever brings the most dollars back to the farmers of the west , that is the route the grain should go .
if we can fill the terminals in Halifax and in Montreal by going through a cheaper route , then it is the God - given right of western producers to have their grain sent that way .
some hon. members :
right on , right on .
Mr. Roy Bailey :
we are not going to tolerate this .
if the government does not want to listen , then it had better start listening to a $ 6 billion industry which is being controlled from Ottawa .
they dictate the transportation route .
we have a new era also in communications .
most of these young farmers are on the Internet .
they know what is going on .
you cannot fool them anymore by Bill C - 4 .
i want to say this .
this bill , if not amended , is doomed to die .
maybe it will get passed in this House .
but as we go into the new year and into the new century , this type of ancient marketing , a monopolistic marketing on the international trade that we have today and unless a farmer is given some freedom , will self - destruct and nobody will be to blame .
that phoney document says that the Canadian Wheat Board , the document the government is so proud of , does not always sell grain in the best interests of the farmer .
that is exactly why were are here .
it is too bad the country cannot see and hear what we are trying to do .
we are trying to preserve an industry that is a billion dollar industry , although we do not have as many people involved in the industry .
we want to save it .
this government is going to destroy it by this bill .
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are here today to discuss Motion No. 2 .
i am having a great problem with everything in this bill .
let us take a look at the clause .
this clause makes the Canadian Wheat Board Act binding on the provinces .
this would block a province from making changes demanded by a majority of its farmers .
correct me if I am wrong , Mr. Speaker .
it was not quite two weeks ago , November 11 , when I happened to speak at a function on a day called Remembrance Day in this country of Canada .
i have to wonder just exactly what they fought for .
they fought to be independent , to be allowed to make their own decisions and to freely sell their products in this country .
everybody seems to be able to do that except western farmers .
in Ontario the board members are freely elected .
with this bill the board in the west will have ten elected members and five who will be appointed by the government .
they will be patronage appointments , including the president and the CEO .
the government needs positions in which to put its friends , relatives and defeated candidates .
farmers are not silly .
it will not take them long to realize that all the rats are not in the granary when they look at what the government is trying to impose upon them .
these are the people who have spent literally hours , more than many members of this House are willing to put in , trying to scrape together a living , only to have the government intrude in every facet of their lives .
we know that under socialism the object is that the farmer grows the product , keeps part of it and the government takes the rest .
under communism the government just takes it .
under liberalism farmers will not only buy product in order to seed the field , they will not only care for the product , they will not only cut it , harvest it and get it to the shipyards , but they will be told who they can sell it to , where they can sell it , at what price they can sell it and what route it will take .
they do not get a bit of help .
i have to wonder how long the farmers will put up with this .
i would suggest not too long .
this bill would block a province from making changes demanded by a majority of its farmers .
who the heck does the government think has spent the time to get the product ready ?
it sure as heck was not the government or any of its members .
the government refuses to allow not only farmers but the majority of citizens in this country to work for profit .
the government fully recognizes that the biggest threat to that side of the House is a farmer or any other businessperson who can stand up and say they are independent .
the government will do everything in the world to block any fashion of businessperson in this country from being able to say that because it knows full well that when a person can stand and say they are independent they no longer have to depend on the government .
yet that is one of the functions that we were taught very young in school .
when I went it was that the harder someone would work , the better they produce , the earlier they could retire .
it is bills like this that make that impossible .
today the harder the farmer works , the more he is penalized .
does that make any sense ?
it does not .
does it make any sense to the government opposite ?
yes , I see some nods over there that it does .
i have to wonder is the government in place to govern for the people or to the people .
i see over there it is to the people , not for the people .
again I have to wonder why our farmers , along with other parts of society , took up arms in order to protect a so - called democratic society .
we see today that it is a total farce .
there is no such thing in this country any more .
we have to look at some of the functions that farmers play .
these are the people who will feed the people and their families , but not as long as they are being driven out of business , not as long as they cannot get the best price they can for the product , not as long as they are told who they can sell to , when they can sell and how much they can charge .
this is not what farming was all about , yet farming was one of the basic institutions that built this country .
they will allow other parts of Canada to become independent and allow them to freely elect the members of their board who will make the decision on how they will make their livelihood .
they will do that but not out west .
god help us if we ever get that decision .
the farmer may be able to put a few dollars in his pocket when he goes to town so that he can afford to buy new clothes for his family for a change .
i have to wonder just how far this government is willing to go to make sure every facet of society is kept broke .
hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to participate this afternoon to put on the record what I think are the feelings of the people of the prairies , particularly Saskatchewan , in terms of some of these amendments .
i know some people watch the parliamentary debate on CPAC .
MPs follow it closely .
we have a member now from Saskatchewan , from Souris - Moose Mountain , who has said that people on the prairies clearly oppose the inclusion clause .
he said they fear for the inclusion clause .
there is overwhelming opposition for the inclusion clause .
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
hon. Lorne Nystrom :
i am glad that they rose to that bait and again showed that they clearly oppose the inclusion clause .
that is why the election results are very important .
we have some balance back in this Parliament , so this kind of misleading information will be challenged in the House of Commons .
i want to put on record , and let them yelp if they want , that here are some of the players that support the inclusion clause .
the Government of Saskatchewan -
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
hon. Lorne Nystrom :
they may laugh .
an hon. member : 38 % .
hon. Lorne Nystrom :
here is the Reform Party that does not have the guts to run in provincial politics in Saskatchewan , a government that has MLAs from all parts of the province , urban and rural .
it supports the inclusion clause and they said nobody does .
misleading of the House .
second , the Canadian Federation of Agriculture supports the inclusion clause .
is that an irrelevant organization ?
does it not speak for a few farmers across the prairies and in the province of Saskatchewan ? I am sure it does .
the people should be aware that the Reform Party is misleading the House and the Canadian people .
an hon. member :
there ' s some cheap barley in Ontario .
hon. Lorne Nystrom :
that is true .
now let them squirm and let them listen because they are being taken to task .
who else supports the inclusion clause ?
the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and the prairie pools .
reformers laugh .
the biggest company in Saskatchewan is the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool .
the wheat pools speak for thousands and thousands of farmers .
and the Reform Party says that nobody does .
the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool does .
finally , the wheat board advisory committee , whose members are elected by prairie farmers , supports the inclusion clause .
the overwhelming majority of people across the prairies and in the province of Saskatchewan are in support of the Canadian Wheat Board and they want an inclusion clause so that if farmers want more grains in the wheat board , they will have that right .
it is about time the Reform Party was taken to task .
the Reform Party is not telling the truth in the House of Commons and not reflecting its constituents ' views .
that is the party that said it would reflect the voices of its constituents when it was in the House of Commons .
it is not doing that .
the Saskatchewan government is supportive .
the Canadian Federation of Agriculture is supportive .
it has now been put to sleep for 10 years .
the Reform Party believes in referenda and in consulting people .
a while back a very clear question was put to the prairie producers .
it concerned whether or not they wanted barley marketed by the wheat board or outside the wheat board .
the prairie producers responded with 63 % who voted that yes , they wanted to keep barley in the Canadian Wheat Board , while 37 % voted no .
they responded to a very clear question .
the Reform Party is supposed to be reflecting those views in the House of Commons .
reformers are supposed to reflect the views of their constituents in the House of Commons or resign or be recalled .
why do they not reflect that point of view in the House of Commons ?
it was a clear question .
the National Farmers Union is also in support of the inclusion clause .
the farmers union itself , which has been very involved in these issues , thought the question was clear .
i wonder where the Reform Party comes from .
when it comes to really representing the point of view of its constituents in the House of Commons it just does not do it .
i assure the House that the people of Saskatchewan support the Canadian Wheat Board .
they have always supported the Canadian Wheat Board .
they want some collective clout in the marketplace and we will reflect that point of view here in the House of Commons .
i have another concern that was raised by the Reform Party , that there is no reference to provinces .
it has been said in the House with some of these rather right wing points of view that they would like the provinces to opt out .
now , of course , Reform Party members applaud these extreme right wing points of view , these friends of Conrad Black , friends of the Canadian grain exchange and of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation .
they listen to them instead of listening to the wheat pool of Saskatchewan , the farmers union or the federation of agriculture or the people ' s organizations .
they just listen to the people who have the money .
they want to destroy the wheat board .
they want a province to have the option of opting out of the Canadian Wheat Board like the province of Alberta .
of course , if that power is put into the act it will be the destruction of the wheat board .
so I certainly oppose that as well .
i am sure that Canadian farmers will also oppose that point of view .
here are some so - called farmers from British Columbia and Alberta who are campaigning against the Canadian Wheat Board .
however , I can assure members of the House that there is very strong support for orderly marketing and for the Canadian Wheat Board .
all the major credible farm organizations that support the board want the inclusion clause .
they want farmers to have the right to vote if they so wish to include other grains under the authority of the Canadian Wheat Board .
they also support the exclusion clause so that farmers if they so wish can vote to have a grain taken out of the authority of the wheat board .
why is the Reform Party against that democratic right ?
it is a right that the farmers want .
i know the truth hurts .
if we listen to the Reform Party we would think there was never a vote on barley or that the question was fudged on barley .
the question was very clear and there was a very clear answer .
i am very surprised that the Saskatchewan Reform members , in particular , are talking this way .
in Saskatchewan the yes vote for the inclusion of barley was higher than in Alberta and Manitoba .
why are Reform members not reflecting the wishes of their constituents in the House ?
why are they not listening to their constituents ?
why should they not be recalled ?
why will this very shy member from Souris - Moose Mountain not get up and say " the farmers in my riding voted to have barley in the wheat board '' ?
that is a bunch of bloody rubbish and he would know it if he used his two ears to listen to his people .
people are very supportive of that clause .
it is important that be put on the record .
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is very difficult to sit hear and listen to some of these things .
i would like the member who just spoke to come out and stand on the street corners of Hussar , Standard , Olds , Sundry or Didsbury and talk to the farmers I talk to day in and day out .
he would find out that what he is saying is not true .
what really amazes me is that they are not talking about freedom of choice .
it does not seem to me that they want it .
but then I have to stop and remember these people are of the old line governments and parties that figure they always know best and they want control .
it is as obvious as it can be .
if the government is not involved , it is no good .
that is the old rule , the old way of doing things .
that is in the past .
a very wise man said to me when I was elected in 1993 " There is one thing about it , you have now obtained power . "
i felt like sticking my chest out a little bit .
i had not had much power before in my life and now he said I have power .
he said he wanted me to remember one thing , " Please remember this on behalf of us .
when you go to Ottawa , the power you have received is the power to serve '' , not the power to dictate like they do behind closed doors .
there is legislation coming out from behind closed doors day in and day out .
it is brought in and presented to the House like Bill C - 4 , and all the little puppets will have their strings pulled and they will jump up and vote the way the party told them to vote .
that is the way they do it .
the Liberals will do what they are told .
they will vote the way they are told to vote .
if members were truly serving Canadians and were truly using their power , they would take the time before casting their votes to go out to the ridings of prairie farmers where the legislation has the most effect and talk to them .
the Liberals got rid of that panel and did not follow those recommendations because they did not suit their little cup of tea .
it is the same old story over and over again .
the Liberals , the NDP , and right down the line .
every old line party that has ever been here says " We know best .
that is something I am sick and tired of .
in 1993 when the Conservatives were in power they had the wisdom to open up the intercontinental barley market .
during that time farmers did better than they had ever done in the history of growing crops .
the wheat board did better than it had ever done .
that is good healthy competition .
that is why farmers are saying keep the wheat board but give us a choice .
i do not believe that is asking for too much .
i can hardly wait to go back home .
a Wild Rose constituent asked me when I expected the minister to rise in the House and announce that canola growers want to market through the board .
my constituent hit the nail on the head .
after all , canola growers have nurtured , researched and developed a former niche industry into an agricultural powerhouse .
the farmers did it .
canola producers did all this without any dictated government involvement .
now that it is to be such a success , mark my words , one day the government will want control of it .
the government ' s power is to dictate .
it has not learned the power to serve .
i challenge government members to do that .
i challenge every one of them when they vote on this piece of legislation to vote in the interest of the people it is affecting , prairie farmers .
god help me if I ever vote against any legislation that hurts the fishing industry .
i talk to fishermen whenever I get a chance .
come on out to Wild Rose .
stand on the street corners and talk to the farmers who grow grain .
ask them what they think about Bill C - 4 .
talk to them one on one .
then it might change some things .
the government ought to start thinking about the power to serve and stop the power of dictation .
the Deputy Speaker :
it is my duty , pursuant to Standing Order 38 , to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques - Employment Insurance .

message FROM THE SENATE
the Deputy Speaker :
i have the honour to inform the House that a message has been received from the Senate informing this House that the Senate has passed Bill S - 3 , an act to amend the Pension Benefits Standards Act , 1985 and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act , to which the concurrence of this House is desired .

CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT
the House resumed consideration of Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts , as reported ( with amendment ) from the committee ; and of Motions Nos. 2 , 31 and 41 .
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , once again I remind Reformers that they are obviously having a very hard time listening to the number of people who support the Canadian Wheat Board .
i would like to mention some of them .
they are the Government of Saskatchewan , the Canadian Federation of Agriculture , prairie pools , the Keystone Agricultural Producers , the National Farmers Union , the Concerned Farmers Saving the Wheat Board and members of the Canadian Wheat Board Advisory Committee who are elected from across the prairies to provide advice to the board ' s operations .
it is extremely important that Canadians do not get caught up in the usual Reform rhetoric that goes on and on about nobody representing the people of Canada except Reformers , that we will never have freedom unless we listen to Reform .
if we want to talk dictatorship let us talk about Reformers spouting they are the only ones who are here on behalf of Canadians and serving them .
i had to listen to the rather childish diatribe from the member for Saskatoon - Humboldt who said " I ' m a farmer , I ' m a farmer , I ' m a farmer " as if nobody else could understand what farmers go through .
numerous people in Canada know what farmers go through , what fishermen go through and what every other person goes through if they take the time to consider those people and to make themselves aware of their troubles .
i suggest that just once Reformers should take a look at the whole picture instead of their own narrow vision .
Mr. Dale Johnston ( Wetaskiwin , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , several things come to mind as an opener , not the least of which is that I too am a farmer .
i guess another thing that should be said is that the times , they are a ' changin ' .
it is a long time since my father and my father - in - law saw the birth of the Canadian Wheat Board .
a lot of things have changed since that time when farmers would haul most of their grain in the winter .
practically all the grain was hauled on sleighs .
the roads were bad during the summertime when they could only use wheeled vehicles and they did not have enough horses to pull a load of wheat through the muddy roads .
they hauled their grain in the wintertime , when they had time to do it as well .
they would haul about 100 bushels of wheat five , ten , twenty or whatever miles it required to get it an elevator .
most elevators were about 20 to 30 miles at the very most from farming communities .
the grain would be hauled in dribs and drabs by today ' s standards to the elevators where it would be loaded on to rail cars and shipped out in greater quantities .
technology has evolved now to the point where we have trucks that can hold two or three the capacity of old time granaries .
once they get the truck rolling it really does not matter how far they have to travel .
once it is loaded on the truck it can be destined for almost anywhere in North America .
the marketing of grain has changed immeasurably in the 50 , 60 or 70 years since the birth of the Canadian Wheat Board .
the Canadian Wheat Board is stuck in the 1920 s .
i listened with great interest to my colleague from the NDP trying to defend the system and all the people he claims support single desk selling .
i asked him to extrapolate his thinking a bit .
i would like to be in that position .
most people in the House would like to be in the position where they would have an absolute monopoly .
that is what we are talking about today .
farmers in western Canada have overcome drought , flood , hail , poor weather , too much rain , not enough rain , seed borne diseases , late yielding varieties and all sorts of things in the production of grain .
we are avoiding frosts .
we have better machinery than we have ever had to work the land , to cut the grain and to combine the grain .
it would seem oftentimes that we have more grain than we know what to do with , or at least what the Canadian Wheat Board knows what to do with .
it would seem production is not the challenge it once was .
the marketing of grain is of the utmost importance .
by introducing these amendments we are trying to put some flexibility into an absolutely inflexible Canadian Wheat Board .
the NDP member from Saskatchewan accused us of wanting to do away with the wheat board .
an hon. member :
hear , hear .
Mr. Dale Johnston :
it would appear our NDP friend from Saskatchewan would agree with that sentiment .
he has it wrong , as usual .
we want to have a flexible wheat board .
we want to have a board where we can be in or out .
why not have a choice ?
let me give my esteemed colleague examples of some things I am sure he supports .
what about co - ops ?
what about credit unions ?
what about pools ?
i am sure my friend from the more socialist party believes those are good things .
let us take a quick look at how they operate .
the boards of directors are elected .
some of those people are not even paid .
they may collect mileage to and from meetings .
they may get their registration fee paid to attend conferences and that sort of thing .
a lot of these people donate their time to the board .
they are elected by the members of the credit union , by the producers in the hog pool , or whatever it is , or by the people who are members of the co - operative .
they are accountable to the people who elect them .
those elected people hire an administrator .
the administrator makes administrative decisions and the elected board makes political decisions .
is there any resemblance between what I have just described and the Canadian Wheat Board ?
none whatsoever .
they are not even in the same ballpark .
we are asking for a completely elected board of directors that is accountable to producers , a wheat board farmers could be members of or excluded from and market their grain one way or the other .
my NDP friend from Saskatchewan said " it will not work if you are not all in it '' .
how does he know that ?
if it did not work because it was not a monopoly , if it will not work without being a monopoly then it must be a pretty poor system .
i think that anybody in this House would say that competition is good .
i am sure my hon. colleague feels very good about the fact that he ran against other opponents in the election and was victorious .
in that case he would say " Certainly competition is great .
we evolved immensely in agriculture in the 60 or 70 years since the dawn of the wheat board .
what we are trying to do is to drag the wheat board and proponents of same kicking and screaming into the 21 st century in a marketing system that answers the requirements , in fact the demands , of the producers .
i wish I could think of the member ' s riding .
the member for Qu ' Appelle likes to say these groups support the inclusion .
let us have a look .
the National Farmers Union , the National Foundation and three others we have listed here .
Mr. Speaker , because of time constraints I have 12 groups of people listed here ; Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association , Winnipeg Commodity Exchange , Canadian Oilseed Processors Association , Alberta Canola Producers , Saskatchewan Canola Growers Association , Canadian Federation of Independent Business , Western Barley Growers Association , Alberta Winter Wheat Producers Commission , Oat Producers Association of Alberta , Flax Growers Western Canada , Manitoba Canola Growers Association and Canadian Canola Growers Association all are vigorously opposed to the inclusion .
i think we will find certainly not the least of which should be added to that is the Reform Party of Canada .
the Deputy Speaker :
the hon. parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans I believe has spoken in the debate .
is he rising on a point of order ?
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i want to outline to the member opposite that the kind of competition he is talking about will be the same as Reformers running against Reformers in an election .
the Deputy Speaker :
i am afraid that the parliamentary secretary has an interesting point , but it is not a point of order .
resuming debate the hon. member for Saskatoon - Humboldt .
Mr. Jim Pankiw ( Saskatoon - Humboldt , Ref. ) :
how many Liberal MPs come from the west ?
we are here representing western farmers .
many of us are farmers and we are telling them plain as day we do not want this .
why can farmers not have the choice ?
wouldn ' t that be good ?
other marketing boards would spring up .
there would be competition .
the Canadian Wheat Board would be driven to get better prices , to find newer and better markets for farmers .
everybody would benefit .
why will they not understand that ?
well I can tell you why .
i see one Liberal member in the House .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
the Deputy Speaker :
tempting as it may be , and I have experience at this I assure the hon. member , to refer to the presence of members , it is improper to refer to the absence of members .
the way the hon. member is phrasing his remarks , he is clearly referring to the absence of certain members .
i invite him to comply with the rules and refrain from making such suggestions .
Mr. Jim Pankiw :
i am sorry , Mr. Speaker , I am trying to draw attention to the fact that they do not care .
they are not here engaging in the debate .
it is sad to feel that we are here trying to tell them why the farmers are asking for changes to the act , but it is falling on deaf ears .
they insult me and make fun of me for saying that I am a farmer and for representing the farmers in my constituency .
he had to put his tail between his legs and go to Regina .
people who live in Regina also are going to be impacted by this because what hurts farmers hurts every community in Saskatchewan and everyone in western Canada .
an hon. member : - Marxist - Leninist .
Mr. Jim Pankiw :
they continue to insult me when I stand up and attempt to defend the right of farmers to have a wheat board that they can participate in when they want , to have a wheat board that they can be elected to , to have a wheat board that is accountable to them and that they can be represented by and not a wheat board that is run by Ottawa under the dictates of Ottawa from Ottawa politicians .
how about having farmers run the Canadian Wheat Board and have farmers determine what is best for them ?
why force that upon anybody ?
there is the idea of an inclusion clause .
we grow a lot of canola on our farm .
what right does anybody have to tell me where I can sell it ?
what right does anybody have to do that to me ?
however , if canola is grown in Ontario , that is okay .
that will not apply .
they will be able to market it wherever they want .
if we apply the inclusion clause to canola in the west , then I am going to be bound to that .
i say - they can insult me all they want - on behalf of all farmers , we do not want that .
how much clearer can a guy be ?
an hon. member :
what about the barley vote ?
an hon. member :
say it slow for him over there .
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i want to correct the member .
he has given the impression to the House that I was suggesting or making fun of farmers .
in actuality , I have the utmost respect -
the Deputy Speaker :
order , please .
i think the hon. member recognizes that her point of order , while interesting , is really a point of debate .
resuming debate .
i think hon. members must realize that remarks are not intended to be personal to hon. members .
i hope they are not taken as such in a debate of this kind .
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Deputy Speaker :

Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to rise and address my comments to Group No. 4 of the amendments before the House .
i must say that it is exceedingly difficult for all of the members from whatever party and whatever point of view to address such a large group of amendments because they deal with so many different areas .
we have 16 amendments in this group that we are going to endeavour to try to adequately address and debate in a short 10 - minute intervention .
in light of there being 16 amendments in 10 minutes , I will have to confine my comments to just a few of them .
perhaps for the viewing public watching this debate at home with interest I am sure , I should note that Group No. 3 comprised Motion No. 3 and was dropped because apparently it had been brought forward at the committee and therefore was ruled out of order .
i did want to make the point when I put that motion forward that what it did was remove reference to the president as a member of the board of directors .
in other words , the president would not have served on the board of directors .
the Deputy Speaker :
the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans on a point of order .
Mr. Wayne Easter :
the Deputy Speaker :
i thought the hon. member was making a passing reference .
he did say it had been ruled out of order and I am sure he is not going to continue discussing the motion .
he is proceeding with his remarks , I am certain .
Mr. Jay Hill :
Mr. Speaker , I was just making passing reference to it for the sake of the viewing public at home who might not have known why we moved straight from Group No. 2 amendments to Group No. 4 .
on to Group No. 4 amendments of which , as I have indicated , there are some 16 , Motion No. 5 is an amendment put forward by myself on behalf of the Reform Party of Canada , the official opposition .
it calls a fully elected board of directors .
the rationale for this is that if this board is going to be put into place for the best interest of farmers , for the best interest of western grain producers , then certainly they should have the right to elect all of the directors to the board .
we have the situation in this legislation where the government and the minister still retain the right to appoint five directors , one of which will be the president and the chief executive officer of the board of directors .
we find that completely reprehensible .
we do not understand the inequity , the inequality in the system whereby the Ontario Wheat Marketing Board can have a fully elected board of directors to run the affairs of the Ontario Wheat Marketing Board and yet western grain farmers are denied that fundamental right of electing their entire board of directors .
we would certainly urge all members of the House in light of that to support Motion No. 5 and ensure that this bill is amended so that we have a fully elected board of directors .
motion No. 7 , also in this Group No. 4 , deletes the powers of the board of directors .
the bill , as it is presently structured , lays out different powers for the appointed directors and the elected directors .
of course , if Motion No. 5 is successful and passes and you have all 15 elected as they should be , then there would be no need to have a differentiation in the powers of those individual directors .
motion No. 9 ensures that the elected board and not the minister would have control over the hiring and firing of the president .
if farmers are to truly have a say in the way that the board operates , I think that this is fundamental .
during committee hearings , the witnesses who appeared before the committee , and time after time we heard this , the groups who appeared , as short as the list was and as confined as the time was allowed at committee , did make the point that they felt that the board of directors should have the power to hire and fire the president and the chief executive officer .
we had some of my hon. colleagues remark about that earlier and cite examples of the credit unions and the co - ops and other successful co - op enterprises where Canadians have seen fit to band together for their mutual financial best interest on a voluntary basis , but they retain the right to elect their board of directors and that board of directors then hires the administrators .
we see no reason whatsoever that this new structure , this new Canadian Wheat Board , would not have a similar process in place .
i would like to add to that and to the comments of my hon. colleague from Wetaskiwin who spoke a few moments ago .
i find it more than a bit strange that the more socialist people in this country , whenever a state run enterprise is under scrutiny , always fall back and say that it cannot exist in a free market economy .
it is in the best interest of the producer , but we have to protect that interest because if there were any competition , it simply would not survive .
in the long term interests of the farmers , in this case the western Canadian grain farmers , we need to ensure that the monopoly , the compulsory nature of the Canadian Wheat Board , is retained .
i find that somewhat puzzling , just as my hon. colleague from Wetaskiwin did , in the sense that there has been a longstanding tradition in western Canada as there has been across this country of enterprises that have not only survived but have indeed thrived in a free market economy .
he cited the examples of the co - ops , the pools and the credit unions which I am familiar with as I am from a rural area and was a farmer in my previous life .
nobody said when credit unions were put into place that Canadians would be forced to join a credit union .
no one said you cannot do your business at a bank because it is in your best interest to belong to a credit union .
imagine the open rebellion there would be in this country if everyone were forced to bank at the same institution .
the credit unions have done quite well .
they have filled a niche market and they continue to enjoy enormous support especially in the rural areas of western Canada .
motion No. 10 would ensure some minimum production level so that the vote of a hobby farmer would not totally cancel out the vote of a full time farmer , someone who is earning his living and has a lot more at stake with the business conducted and the decisions made by the Canadian Wheat Board than someone who is earning all or most of his income off the farm .
the rationale for Motion No. 11 is that once the initial elections have taken place , the minister ' s involvement in the election of the director should be limited if farmer interests are to be served .
the minister ' s control of the barley plebiscite earlier this year proved that at times when a minister is directly involved , he can structure a vote to ensure the outcome he wants .
motion No. 14 also refers to the hiring and firing of the president .
at the end of the day it is the board of directors that must retain that control over the president and the president cannot be beholden in any way to the minister or to the government of the day .
it is very difficult when we look at the way many of these motions are grouped to go through them in a singular manner .
i refer briefly to Motion No. 19 which ensures that the new corporation will have to adhere to the code of ethics guidelines for corporations .
the federal government initiated the signing of this code by Canadian businesses in September 1997 .
the code sets out standards for ethically , socially and environmentally responsible business practices .
however , the federal government did not instruct its departments and agencies to sign the code .
given that the wheat board markets extensively abroad we feel it is more than appropriate that the corporation become a signatory to the code in which it would commit among other things not to make illegal and improper payments or bribes and will refrain from participating in any corrupt business practices .
that is just a small part of the code .
it is interesting to note that question was put to the government by an hon. member during question period , that it is pretty hypocritical of the government to insist that businesses now adhere to this code when crown agencies themselves are not required to .
that is the purpose of that amendment .
i look forward to a return of the lively debate we have seen over the past hours .
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to take part in this interesting grouping as previous speakers have indicated .
motions Nos. 4 through 19 include a large variety of important items , the election of all directors , giving the standing committee some insight into the ongoing work of the Canadian Wheat Board , the equality of those who are elected and those who are appointed , the removal of the president and how we would proceed on that important note should it ever come to that , minimum production levels , which I will come back to in a short while , regulations respecting elections and the staggering of elections , which I think is an important point as well , the terms for the president , code of ethics and so on .
i did want to talk a bit about Motion No. 10 . This is a motion put forward by the previous speaker , the member for Prince George - Peace River .
i think I understand what he is getting at here .
he wants a minimum level .
in fact , he talked about the difference between a hobby farmer and a somebody who earns his living in farming and who should have the right to vote and who should not .
i want to go on record to say that this caucus will very strongly oppose that .
i heard a member from that party talk about two tier .
if there is anything that is two tier it is clearly this .
in this caucus we think that as long as a farmer is sending one bushel of grain to the wheat board that he or she should have the right to a vote on the election of the board of directors .
( 3 ) Directors shall be elected by producers on the basis of one vote per producer permit book
( 4 ) There shall be limits placed on the expenditures made by any candidate for election to the Board of Directors .
this is a very important aspect of it :
( 5 ) There shall be limits placed on the expenditures made by any third parties toward the election of candidates to the Board of Directors .
i want to elaborate on Motion No. 13 if I may .
if the wheat board is to have a board of directors , and we certainly go along with that , then it is essential that the majority of them are elected through free and fair elections .
that means , as I said before , one vote per producer holding a wheat board permit book .
it seems to me on Motion No. 10 that the Reform Party wants to see the large scale agribusiness farmers have more votes and more clout than their neighbours .
we say this is totally anti - democratic and we want no part of it .
fair elections also mean a limit on campaign spending by candidates just as in federal and provincial elections so that wealthy individuals do not have an unfair advantage .
fair elections mean the strict and transparent limit as to how much third parties can spend on elections and how much they influence the outcome .
we are reminded of the million dollars that the Alberta government poured into the barley vote last year to try to influence that one and fortunately to little or no avail .
as has been pointed out repeatedly , the wheat board is a $ 6 billion industry and certain corporate interests would love to get their hands on it .
western grain farmers do not want those folks with deeper pockets than the rest of us to influence these elections unduly on the board of directors .
we are also witnessing what could only be termed as a disgraceful media campaign by other friends of the Reform Party , the National Citizens Coalition , again to try to discredit the Canadian Wheat Board .
the coalition claims to be funded by ordinary Canadians , but we all know that it is bankrolled by the friends of the Reform Party and the the big business community in this country .
we know who is in line to be the next president of the National Citizens Coalition , a former member of the Reform caucus .
with those points , we think it is very important that the election of the new board of directors be done in a free and fair way .
we will be watching and hoping that the government will move to make some accommodation so that can result .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie ( Louis - H 茅 bert , BQ ) :
the first motion in Group No. 4 , Motion No. 4 moved by Mr. Borotsik , proposes that 10 out of 15 directors be elected .
there is a small problem , however , because this motion means that directors would be elected according to regulations made by the governor in council as set out in clauses 3.06 to 3.08 .
this eliminates what makes clause 3 attactive , which is that producers are appointed by other producers .
there is no longer a specific reference to their being elected by producers , as was the case in clause 3.02 .
this reduces the significanace of the representation by producers on the board of directors .
it is the same for the amendment deleting the paragraph about the maximum term of office of directors , and this is unthinkable .
we are therefore going to be voting against this motion , although we were very much in favour of greater representation by producers .
motion No. 5 would increase the number of directors on the board from 15 to 20 .
for the reasons I gave earlier , we will vote in favour of this amendment , which fits in with our wish for greater representation and a greater role on the board of directors for producers .
now , on to Motion No. 6 . I am certain that , had my colleague , Mr. Chr 茅 tien , been able to debate it , he would have done a splendid job .
an hon. member :
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie :
jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien of the Bloc Quebecois .
jean - Guy on this side , not Jean on that side .
Mr. Chr 茅 tien pointed out that the government does not want the president to be appointed by members of the board of directors but by the governor in council .
the Bloc is therefore moving that this appointment be considered by the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri - food .
we did not get the results we were hoping for when this bill was considered in committee , but we still believe in the strength of this committee and the interventions that must be made , and we think that the appointments should be subject to the approval of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri - food .
this brings me to Motion No. 7 . The proposed amendment would create a potential distinction between the powers , duties and functions of a director who is elected and those of one who is appointed .
at this point , we have little or no idea of what this amendment would mean in practical terms , and in the absence of information , we are abstaining .
in Motion No. 8 , the proposed amendment would set the board ' s quorum at two - thirds of the board members and a ratio of two elected directors to one appointed director .
if we keep looking at what it wanted at the grassroots level , namely , greater control by grain producers , farmers and people who have a major interest in this bill , we do of course support an amendment that would see a quorum of at least two - thirds of the board members , thus twice as many elected directors .
we therefore support this amendment , because it puts power in the hands of the board .
and as we want the amendments to increase the number of farmers to be agreed to , for reasons of consistency we support this motion .
this brings us to Motion No. 10 . Under this amendment , in the bylaws for board members , the governor in council should give a vote to producers producing a certain quantity of grain .
i listened with considerable interest to remarks made in this House on this motion .
however , the experience I have had in my riding of having many part time farmers and realizing that they provide strong and solid support to the agricultural community makes it hard for me to oppose their participation , however limited , in the Canadian Wheat Board .
if the Canadian Wheat Board is there to efficiently market a crop - I heard some colleagues say this morning that it was a bit of a monopoly , but it is not a monopoly when it is in the hands of the producers , in my opinion - it is appropriate for all these producers , even the smallest ones , if the Canadian Wheat Board is a good one , to be protected by a structure for the marketing of their crop .
for this reason we will vote against this motion .
this is a very subtle point , but basically the power is given to the people who have to do the administration , and not the minister .
i have been surprised to hear very little reference to increased federal government power over the Canadian Wheat Board where there is a possibility of some difficulty with the rules of international trade .
this amendment returns much more power to the board of directors , and moves the minister onto the back burner .
this may not be what our friends across the way are after , but I believe we must attain that objective if the Canadian Wheat Board is to be properly administered .
that is why we will vote for Motion No. 11 .
motion No. 12 is much like 11 . Moreover , in the motions that follow there are some things that overlap .
we totally agree with this motion , which reduces the federal government ' s power to appoint someone to this position for an indeterminate period .
you can see that the same logic has been followed from the start and there is an attempt to give more power to farmers on the Canadian Wheat Board and the board of directors , and thus to move it a little away from the control of the federal government .
as for Motion No. 16 , its purpose is to have the president implement measures no later than six months following the first election of the board of directors to include the Canadian Wheat Board as a signatory to the International Code of Ethics for Canadian Business .
this , I believe , is self - evident .
we will therefore vote in favour of this motion .
we shall do likewise for Motion No. 19 , which is a consequence , or at least a corollary , of Motion No. 16 , in which it is stated , as has already been mentioned , that the code of ethics governs the conduct of Canadian businesses abroad by ensuring that they do not exploit child labour and that they apply the same labour standards elsewhere as they do here .
what this means , therefore , is that the Canadian Wheat Board must act as a good corporate citizen both here and elsewhere .
now for Motion No. 17 , the amendment on the absence or inability to act of the president , I think that this is a routine matter , this is normal .
we will therefore vote for there to be a replacement when required .
finally , to address Motion No. 18 , where the amendment stipulates that the board members shall act in the performance of their duties with integrity and good faith , which I do not doubt .
we will therefore vote in favour of this statement of good intention .
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
these amendments have been grouped together , as a number of them work in conjunction with each other .
there are two areas in this legislation about which I am concerned .
one of the areas has been dealt with to a certain degree and we will get to it a little later when we debate the amendment with respect to the inclusion clause .
exclusion and inclusion are very serious components of this legislation and should be amended in order to improve the legislation .
the second area about which I have very serious concerns is the governing section of the legislation .
there have been substantial improvements put forward in this legislation which improve the existing governance of the Canadian Wheat Board .
for those who do not know , the current governance of the Canadian Wheat Board consists of a membership board , a commission if you will , with a maximum of five commissioners .
currently there are three commissioners acting as the head of the Canadian Wheat Board .
there is also an advisory board .
the advisory board is made up of elected representatives , but the advisory board has absolutely no power .
it is a eunuch .
it simply advises not only the commissioners but the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board .
as proposed , this legislation would improve that governance .
in fact , there would be 10 elected board members out of the 15 who will comprise the membership of the Canadian Wheat Board .
ten will be elected and five will be appointed .
in our motion we have proposed a change to make it a fully democratic board of 15 elected members .
there is no reason the government should have any objection to having a fully accountable board of directors elected by the producers .
a precedent has already been set with respect to this type of governance .
the Ontario wheat board has a fully elected board of directors .
it makes sense that a parallel organization , the Canadian Wheat Board , should have elected members .
the government will say because it has certain requirements and certain guarantees that are outstanding for the Canadian Wheat Board that it has to have five appointed members of which one is the chief executive officer .
that is absolute hogwash .
it is not necessary .
as part of governance there is a manager , a chief executive officer , referred to in the legislation as president .
the president under this legislation will be appointed by the government and the minister .
i can say from experience I have had in the House over the very short period of time that the government has not given us an awful lot confidence in those people it will be appointing to the position of chief executive officer .
there have been examples of people who do not understand the business of being appointed as chief executive officer .
this is the individual who is going to be taking a corporation from the year 1997 into the 21 st century .
here is an individual who has to have an awful lot of business acumen , understanding of the business , understanding of the industry , understanding of trade arrangements and organizations in order for us to succeed as western Canadian grain producers .
this cannot be a Liberal patronage appointment , which unfortunately has been shown to happen many times in the past .
i am very nervous of that situation .
there is no reason why an elected board of directors cannot have the confidence placed in them to appoint and hire a chief executive officer .
that is what these amendments speak to .
i talk about governance .
we have the board of directors and a chief executive officer .
i have some further concerns when we talk about the current commissioners who are now operating the Canadian Wheat Board .
they run under a very sheltered cocoon operation , obviously , having it as a monopoly corporation .
it runs basically the same way now as it did in 1943 .
` i am prepared to do it , be the chief executive officers , but the price has to be right ''' .
i have some concerns about that because , quite frankly , what has to be right has to be right for producers and Canadian farmers , not what is right for a chief executive officer or for a minister of the crown .
so that speaks to these amendments , where in fact we should have a fully accountable elected board of directors and an appointed chief executive officer by the board .
it obviously found its way to the amendments here .
that obviously means quorum , but when I read this I almost had unanimous consent of the committee .
however , the amendment is a legitimate and logical one .
it was an amendment put forward by the hon. member for Peace River .
it speaks to the actual election of the board of directors and the criteria people must achieve before they can register a vote for the board of directors .
i understand where the hon. member is coming from because there are large and small producers .
all producers should have a vote for the person they wish to have on the board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board .
we will not be supporting the amendment .
i appreciate where it is coming from and I understand why it is there .
it has merit but it flies in the face of democracy .
in wrapping up on this section I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries would like to be the CEO of the Canadian Wheat Board .
in a brief rebuttal , let me say that a number of organizations and people are still very concerned about the inclusion clause .
we will have a chance to speak to that in another category that is coming up .
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , earlier today in the Chamber the hon. member for Skeena started to talk about the Liberal approach to managing and controlling all aspects of our economy .
he referred to marketing boards that were set up by the Hon. Eugene Whelan .
he should be aware that when Eugene Whelan became agriculture minister there were already over 108 marketing boards in existence in Canada , mostly provincial .
when the member talked about it being a Liberal policy , it is ironic that the provinces with a long history of Conservative governments also had a long history of marketing boards .
there were 25 marketing boards in existence under the government of Bill Davis .
i want to ensure the member for Skeena knows what a marketing board is if in the future he wants to talk about it .
i thought I would put on record that marketing boards vary in practice but the principle is very simple .
it is a system whereby producers , in this case the farmers in case the Reform Party does not know what those are , pool their products , decide on a cost price formula , when and how much to produce , how much to sell and at what price .
as was not understood by the member for Skeena , farmers have democratic control over a marketing board .
they run it themselves .
it is not forced on them .
a marketing board for perishable products makes the most sense .
that is the difference .
the member for Skeena did not understand that marketing boards are mainly for perishable products in Canada .
some products can be stored in a bin for years but that cannot be done with a pound of butter or meat .
to produce a surplus of perishable products and assume that the market will take care of it is utter economic nonsense and wasteful .
" a marketing board is an efficient way of protecting domestic producers and assuring that there will always have a supply for domestic consumption '' .
the hon. member could have read that .
he also talked about rotten eggs .
again it showed a lack of understanding of the industry .
i challenge the member for Skeena to find another industry that did so well .
it is quite impressive when we remember that we are dealing with a perishable product .
it is interesting to note that the person he referred to , Eugene Whelan , was not responsible for the storage facility but only for the legislation establishing the board .
it is even more ironic that same person , Eugene Whelan , became the first agriculture minister in Canadian history not to have to subsidize the poultry industry .
it is interesting how the Reform Party throws in comments and does not recognize the importance of marketing strategies or , in particular in this case , the difference between marketing boards for perishable products and the Canadian Wheat Board .
the Canadian Wheat Board is guaranteed for all farmers .
to end my comments today , I wanted to say that the only rotten egg in parliament today was the member for Skeena .
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , that is a hard act to follow and I will try not to do so .
the issues are so wide ranging that it will be very difficult to touch on half of them in the time I have .
i am concerned about the fact that the amendments are not grouped in a way that would make debate a little easier .
the first motion I want to talk about is Motion No. 5 brought forward by the Reform member for Peace River .
the member for Brandon - Souris already talked about this amendment .
it was interested that he was quoted in a newspaper recently as saying he had found friends in the Liberals and the New Democrats but would never co - operate or find friends in the Reform .
yet here he is fully supporting the amendment of the member for Peace River .
i appreciate the change of heart on the part of that member .
i think it is progress .
the member for Brandon - Souris presented the case on Motion No. 5 quite well .
i think I can leave it at that .
he did a good job of explaining that amendment .
the next amendment I will talk about is Motion No. 8 which I put forward .
we think farmers will settle for nothing less .
we are to get a partially appointed and partially elected board .
depending on how quorum is set by the minister , I have concern that a quorum could consist of all appointed directors .
in a case where a meeting is called and for some reason the elected members cannot make it to the meeting , we have nothing to assure us that a board of only appointed members could make serious decisions about the future of the board or about operations of the company .
i do not think this amendment could possibly be opposed by government members .
it would ensure that we have a good quorum with at least two - thirds of the members , 10 out of the 15 , and that we have a ratio of at least 2:1 , two elected directors and one appointed .
that is very important .
we can then be assured that at least the elected directors will be there and will have their say at the meetings .
i encourage the government to support Motion No. 8 . It will be difficult to understand why It would not .
i will talk a bit now about Motion No. 9 . It concerns the hiring and firing of the president - CEO .
the way Bill C - 4 amends the Canadian Wheat Board Act the minister would appoint the person to the position of president - CEO .
it is very unusual for a president and a CEO to be the same person .
it is very unusual to have the chief executive officer whose job is to run the daily operations of the company also sitting on the board as its president .
it is extremely difficult to understand why the government would propose that type of a situation .
let us look at the background , at the philosophy of wheat pools , for example .
members opposite often refer to what pools offer and how pools operate .
if they looked at how pools and co - operatives operate they would know that no one but an elected board of directors would hire or fire the president of the board .
for example , delegates and directors of the Alberta Wheat Pool are elected by members who meet .
first they elect a president .
then the same board of directors hires the chief executive officer .
at any time they choose they can fire the chief executive officer .
these people would never be the same two people .
it is a situation which to some extent would involve a conflict of interest , having the chief executive officer who is to carry out the wishes of the board of the directors sitting on the board as president .
having one person filling both positions is extremely unusual .
if we look at the model set out by co - operatives and by the prairie pools we find that it is in complete conflict with what the government has done in Bill C - 4 , an act to amend the Canadian Wheat Board Act .
motion No. 9 in the name of the member for Prince George - Peace River is an extremely important amendment .
it is important that this is passed .
i hope members opposite will understand the importance of the motion , especially those who so strongly support co - operatives as I do .
let us learn from what we have seen in co - operatives .
there are several other motions that I want to talk about , but I will have to limit myself in that I only have a few minutes .
the next one is Motion No. 10 . It deals with who should vote and how many votes a certain operation should have .
we do not know how the voting will be set up .
that is a concern because it should be in the legislation .
that will not happen .
the regulation will be set after the bill is passed as it surely will be because the government will ram it through .
a member of the NDP said earlier that a farmer that grows one bushel of grain should have the same vote as a farm that has a permit book and may be the sole means of support of three , four or five families .
many farms have one permit book for several families .
that member said that a farmer who grows one bushel of grain should have one vote the same as a farm that supports three , four or five families .
it is nonsense .
it makes no sense .
a commercial farm would grow many times that .
it is certainly not a number that would eliminate any farmers who are anywhere near being commercial farmers .
another change that must take place in the voting arrangements is to make it so that farmers who do not have a permit book but who grow grains like wheat and barley that are under wheat board jurisdiction will have a right to vote .
why should they not be allowed to vote when it comes time to elect a director to the Canadian Wheat Board ?
the answer is very difficult to understand .
i have heard several members of Parliament from other parties say that is the way it should be .
if you do not have a permit book , you should not be eligible to vote .
of course that will all be determined in the regulations and we do not know what will be in the regulations .
maybe the government will see the error of its ways here and completely scrap this bill .
it might happen .
in my dreams it will happen .
i suppose it is not very likely .
this piece of legislation should be scrapped because clearly it is not going to do anything to improve the Canadian Wheat Board .
it is not going to make it any more accountable to prairie farmers .
it is not going to reduce the power and control of this government and of the minister .
i think that is another extremely important amendment .
since I am getting an indication that my time is up , I will say that I have so much more that I would like to say to these amendments .
if I have no more time , I will make some further comments when we get to future amendments .
it is important that there are members of the Reform Party who can really identify with the farmers who will be affected by this legislation to speak out on these amendments .
the Deputy Speaker :
order .
it being 5.30 p.m. , the House will now proceed to the consideration of private members ' business as listed on today ' s Order Paper .
private MEMBERS ' BUSINESS
agreement ON INTERNAL TRADE IMPLEMENTATION ACT
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to rise to speak to my private member ' s bill which I believe will do an awful lot to remove barriers to trade between provinces within Canada and between businesses within a province .
i will give some background to this bill , I will speak on what Bill C - 203 will do , I will talk about the importance to Canadians of implementing this bill , then I will do something very important and read from letters of support I have received from various institutions and individuals across the country .
it came into effect in July 1995 and I took part in the debate that preceded the passing of the bill .
i supported the bill .
i did not think it had gone far enough , I did not think it was strong enough , but I supported many aspects of the bill as did the Reform Party .
it was right to support it .
many of our concerns were very legitimate .
the agreement came into effect in 1995 , but what the agreement really did was set a timeline and a framework for future negotiations that would complete an Agreement on Internal Trade , that agreement which would remove most of the barriers to internal trade within the country .
the dates that were set have passed .
what we find is a situation where a piece of legislation which had good intent , which was passed by this government in 1995 , has had very little positive effect on its stated purpose which was to remove the barriers to internal trade within this country .
so it has not done the job .
a main part of the reason that it has not done the job is due to a couple of terms used in the agreement , particularly the term " agreement by consensus " between the provinces , the federal government and the territories , or between all provinces and the territories .
this term " agreement by consensus " has been interpreted by this group to mean " unanimous consent '' .
the way the provinces and the territories have been interpreting this term " agreement by consensus " is that every single province and each territory and the federal government must all agree to any change which would help complete the Agreement to Internal Trade .
that is a formula which is much more realistic and which will allow , I believe , the completion of this Agreement on Internal Trade .
with the completion of the Agreement on Internal Trade will come removal of most of the barriers to trade within this country .
i will talk a little later about the importance of that to Canadians .
back to a little bit of background , I have had people say : " With what you are proposing '' - not many , mind you ; they have mostly been from the Liberal Party - `` are you not letting the federal government be heavy - handed in this issue ? "
in fact , that is not the case at all .
it is not the case at all because again what I am saying is that only in cases where the provinces and the federal government and the territories together have not been able to reach an agreement could the federal government impose a settlement when we have had agreement of at least seven provinces , including at least 50 % of the population .
second , Bill C - 203 would apply only to cases where the proposal falls within the federal legislative powers as established by the Constitution Act of 1867 .
that is the part of the act that relates to the interprovincial trade .
particularly , we are talking about section 91 of the BNA Act of 1867 , which states that legislative authority of Parliament extends to the regulation of trade and commerce , and section 121 of the BNA Act which states that all articles of growth , produce or manufacture of any one of the provinces shall , from after the union , be permitted into each of the provinces .
clearly , section 121 of the BNA Act says that it is the obligation of the federal government to ensure free movement between provinces .
the federal government has abdicated this responsibility in particular for the last 80 , 90 years and it has allowed one barrier after another , after another , after another build up so that we do not have free movement of goods in this country anymore .
it has come to the point where people who run successful companies have come to me and said " It is absolutely ridiculous in this country when it is more difficult for me to move goods to another province than it is for me to do business with a company in the United States '' .
i have also had people who run successful companies come to me and say " I have stayed in Canada as long as I possibly can .
i want to be a Canadian .
i want to do business in this country .
it makes no sense .
it is costing Canadians an awful lot of money .
i will mention some of the studies that have been done which have shown the cost to Canadians .
the Canadian Chamber of Commerce stated that a 10 % increase in internal trade would result in 200,000 new jobs .
with unemployment hanging around 9 % , those 200,000 new jobs would be very important indeed .
of course , an increase in internal trade beyond 10 % would mean even more jobs .
the Canadian Manufacturers ' Association stated that removing these barriers to internal trade would mean $ 6 million to $ 10 million more being put into the Canadian economy .
that would have a huge impact .
i know I only have five minutes remaining , so I am going to skip over some of the things I was going to cover .
however , I am going to refer to two studies which I believe must be referred to when we are talking about the complete lack of success of the agreement on internal trade that was passed in 1995 .
a federal study leaked last May found that the agreement on internal trade only addresses 13 % of the thousands of interprovincial trade barriers faced by the 50 companies who were taking part in this government survey .
the study found that 56 % of the trade barriers could be addressed if the agreement were completed .
only 13 % had been removed , but 56 % of the barriers would be removed if the agreement were completed .
we have to wonder why this government has not been more serious about removing these barriers .
surely that alone should indicate that this government should implement this bill .
if it does not like the bill exactly as it is , then I say " Go ahead .
make the changes that you want to make to it , but put in place legislation which will implement the agreement on internal trade '' .
it is too important to Canadians to ignore .
last spring the Canadian Federation of Independent Business asked their members the following question :
should the federal government take steps to ensure that the provisions of the agreement on internal trade are enforced without further delay ?
i would like to refer to some letters of support which I received from important groups in Canada .
i sent a letter to a couple of dozen key institutions across the country and asked them if they would write a letter of support specifically for my private member ' s bill .
much has been made of the success Canadian businesses enjoy in a free trade environment within North America , and the opportunity to improve trade conditions in Canada is overdue .
that is from the British Columbia Chamber of Commerce .
from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , Catherine Swift , CEO , a letter written November 4 , 1997 in response to that same letter : " Thank you for your recent letter on Bill C - 202 , an act to amend the Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act .
small and medium size businesses in Canada have long supported the elimination of internal trade barriers and welcome your initiative on this matter .
" in your letter , you cited CFIB ' s recent mandate ballot survey which showed that 58 % of the respondents supported the federal government ensuring that provisions to the agreement on internal trade are enforced without further delay .
" i have attached the full text of the question as well as two earlier member votes on related topics to your information .
" please be assured that Canada ' s small businesses are supportive of your initiatives in this area '' .
they also expressed the importance of the barriers to internal trade being removed in this country .
so many of the letters really stressed their disappointment in the lack of action on the part of this government when it came to making some progress on implementing the agreement on internal trade , finishing the deal so that we have barriers to trade reduced and eliminated in this country .
we have the information from studies on the importance of removing these barriers to internal trade .
the industry minister has stated on several occasions that he thinks this is an important issue .
every single province and every territory in this country said that if the agreement on internal trade is passed , the people of their provinces would be better off .
that confirms the information that has been received from studies and from the responses I have received from the letters I have sent out on this bill .
i appreciate the time given to me to present my bill and to make some key points on it .
i look forward to the debate from other members on this bill .
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to speak on Bill C - 203 , an act to amend the agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act .
this bill serves as a timely reminder of how important trade is to Canada not only in international but in domestic trade .
from its very beginning , Canada has been a trading nation .
trade is the lifeblood of this country .
the well - being of Canadians depends on our ability to create and profit from competitive trading environments both at home and abroad .
it was for that reason that the federal government and the provincial governments during 1993 and 1994 negotiated the agreement on internal trade .
the purpose of the agreement was to create a framework for continued co - operative efforts among governments to open up the domestic market .
it established a set of rules and a work program aimed at ensuring the free flow of goods , services , people and capital and , more generally , governing trade and trade disputes between provinces and territories .
the agreement on internal trade came into effect July 1 , 1995 .
it is no secret that there are problems with the agreement .
from the start , the government recognized that the agreement was only a first step .
we have accordingly consistently sought to bring other governments to agree to make it a more effective instrument for economic growth .
the Minister of Industry has at every meeting on internal trade pressed his provincial colleagues to ensure the work mandated by the agreement was done within the deadlines set .
he has repeatedly challenged the other parties to the agreement to seriously consider ways to improve both its scope and the way it operates .
recent studies and reports by business organizations such as the chamber of commerce and other observers have underlined many of the weaknesses in the agreement .
they have pulled few punches in identifying the reluctance of various provincial governments to live up to the spirit or the letter of their commitments .
most of these observers have identified the decision making process and the agreement , that is , its requirement for a consensus as a major impediment to progress .
this bill reflects an attempt to address that particular issue .
the intent is understandable .
the bill itself , unfortunately , is neither realistic nor practical .
as most hon. members will recall , last year we considered and passed the Agreement on Internal Trade implementation Act which this bill proposes to amend .
the government introduced that legislation in 1995 because we were then and remain today firmly committed to making the agreement work .
the Agreement on Internal Trade and Implementation Act enables the federal government to meet its obligations under the agreement on internal trade .
that legislation was necessary to give the government the appropriate authority and specific tools to act within its own areas of direct responsibility .
however , it is most important to recognize that our Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act and the agreement on internal trade are quite different and distinct instruments .
the one is legislation by and for only one government within its own jurisdiction and powers .
the other is a collectively achieved accord on how all the governments that are party to it will exercise their respective powers within their own jurisdictions .
the agreement on internal trade was the outcome of a difficult process of negotiations between the federal government , the provinces and the territories during 1993 and 1994 .
the authority of the agreement on internal trade does not derive from federal legislation .
rather , the authority of the agreement on internal trade derives from the commitments , obligations and undertakings which all governments accepted when they signed it .
that is a fundamental point which the bill before us fails to recognize .
simply put , no one party to the agreement on internal trade can on its own amend that agreement .
that is what this bill is attempting to do .
there are therefore two main reasons why this bill is inappropriate .
first , it cannot accomplish what it wishes to do , which is amend the agreement on internal trade without the agreement of all the other governments that signed it .
second , it directly conflicts with the fundamental basis on which the agreement was negotiated , co - operation , joint action and national interest .
the Canadian business sector has a legitimate expectation that the agreement on internal trade should deal effectively with internal trade barriers and impediments .
it has a legitimate expectation that the agreement should also deal with the burden of extra costs imposed by conflicting , overlapping and duplicate regulatory requirements .
ordinary Canadians have a legitimate expectation that the agreement should make it possible for them to live and work wherever they can be gainfully employed or wherever they are able to provide marketable services .
all Canadians have a legitimate expectation that the agreement should make it possible for them to invest freely and conduct honest business freely throughout the country .
the agreement as it now stands does not deliver on those expectations .
it is only a first step .
the fact is that dealing definitively with internal trade issues is not a simple task .
it is easy to read through sections 91 ( a ) or 121 of the Constitution and conclude that what is needed is bold and decisive action by the federal government ; easy but simplistic and ultimately ineffective .
it is simplistic because unilateral federal action could not address some areas that are exclusively within provincial jurisdiction like labour mobility or local government spending on subsidies and other incentives .
it is ultimately ineffective because it fails to recognize how this country works best .
permanent , practical and effective change is best achieved when based on acceptance and co - operation among governments , not on the basis of legalism and coercion .
all governments in Canada must work together to ensure that the national economy is strong , efficient and producing new products , services , jobs and growth opportunities .
it is important to that end that all governments be pressed to make the agreement on internal trade work better .
while I cannot support this bill before us for the reasons I have outlined , I hope its message will not be lost by other governments and that the member opposite proposing this bill encourage in his own province that his own province be proactive and a leader in making sure that internal trade barriers come down .
in that regard , it is encouraging that the provincial premiers at their annual meeting in August directed their ministers and officials to complete the outstanding work of the agreement and to embark on a major expansion of the activity under it .
this government certainly can be counted on to continue to try to co - operate and work with others to strengthen and improve the agreement on internal trade .
we look to others to work with us and be proactive to make things happen .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is with great interest that I rise to speak to Bill C - 203 , the purpose of which is to amend , and I will come back to this in detail , the Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act .
i am glad to see you there , Mr. Speaker , because I am sure that this is a topic of great concern to you and that you will listen closely to what I have to say .
two topics seem to have you terribly worried lately ; obviously , the postal dispute , and the impossibility of delivering mail from your riding , as well as your inability to send out your seasonal greetings in the coming weeks .
i know that this concerns you greatly , and that internal trade weighs just as heavily on your mind .
what is the bill before us all about ?
i will read the bill ' s summary , which explains this very clearly .
this enactment will give the Governor in Council -
this enactment will give the Governor in Council the power to bring a proposal into force under the Agreement if , although not having unanimous provincial consent , it nevertheless has the consent of two thirds of the provinces that have at least fifty per cent of the population of Canada .
this would apply only to cases where the proposal falls within the federal legislative powers established by the Constitution Act , 1867 that relate to free interprovincial trade .
there are two parts to this bill : the first is the amending formula , and the second deals with the jurisdiction of the federal government in matters of interprovincial trade .
i will start with the first point .
right now , the approach is based on consensus , meaning that the agreement of all the provinces is needed before proceeding .
it strikes me as very appropriate to ensure that the parties involved agree before the rules affecting them are passed .
the big risk in the proposed formula is that the government would be imposing rules on the provinces with which they were not in agreement , and the odds are that , if these provinces were not in agreement , it would be because their citizens were not in agreement either .
when it comes to questions of trade , whether we are talking about opening up borders to international trade or about interprovincial trade , there is obviously very strong pressure to liberalize that trade , but at the same time there is also pressure to do so with respect for the particular characteristics of diverse industries .
there is , for example , the whole issue of the colouring of margarine , which is of concern to a lot of dairy producers .
we have to understand their concerns .
so , it is certainly not up to the federal Parliament to decide to impose rules without a consensus among the provinces involved .
so , I repeat , the current practice , a relatively recent one , is to obtain the unanimous support of the provinces .
however , no Bloc Quebecois member would agree in this House to this formula , which , in the case of interprovincial trade , would reduce the powers currently enjoyed by Quebec .
i have a warning , because I know the members of the government are listening carefully .
there is a danger in interprovincial trade .
this is my second point , and I will move to it now because it follows nicely .
the danger is that little by little the federal government - and the supreme court has given it all the tools it needs - will claim that many sectors of interprovincial trade are under its jurisdiction .
we are not concerned with the Criminal Code here , but I will explain how that would work anyway .
the federal government would introduce criminal offences in a particular sector to claim that it had jurisdiction .
whenever there have been disputes , the supreme court has always ruled in favour of the federal government .
this happened again recently .
there were a series of decisions recently - I will not look at all of them individually - which meant that everything was on the table if the federal government decided to go ahead and use this provision of good order or good government to take over areas of provincial jurisdiction with respect to interprovincial trade .
this is undesirable and I hope the federal government will not resort to this .
it knows very well that , because of the way the court interpreted the Canadian Constitution in its decision , there would be the potential for the federal government to centralize further .
therefore , as I was saying , there are two aspects to the bill .
the seven and fifty formula , which is unacceptable to a province such as Quebec , would also be inconsistent with the claims of a number of political parties , although in the case of the Reform Party , this is less and less obvious , that they support the unique character of Quebec , the new phrase we have been hearing .
this formula merely adds force to our argument that Quebec can been considered to have a unique character on paper , in a declaration with no constitutional value , but when it comes to introducing bills or making legislation , and so forth , that does not count .
this has symbolic value , it is a piece of paper that can be given to Daniel Johnson to parade around with in the next election campaign .
it is clear that if the Calgary declaration were sold under that angle , it would sell even less well than now .
that agreement is not out of the woods yet , but that is not what we are debating now .
now back to the second aspect , which states that the seven and fifty formula ought to be used for jurisdictions currently belonging to the federal government .
this is what I am explaining .
the problem is that the federal government is then going to claim that other areas of jurisdiction belong to it , where interprovincial trade is concerned .
we can pretty well bet that the supreme court would back it up , as usual .
there is an old expression in Quebec , with which you are very familiar , which says that the supreme court is like the Leaning tower of Pisa , it always leans in the same direction .
in the case of interprovincial trade , once again they are nibbling away at the powers of the provinces - in the case I refer to , the powers of Quebec - so that the federal government from the heights of its great wisdom here in Ottawa can declare that it is in the best position to ensure the proper operation of government .
they would say that good governance and law and order should be left with the federal government .
now , as far as interprovincial trade per se is concerned , it would clearly be desirable to further harmonize all kinds of existing regulations .
i am in a good position to comment on this , since I live in a border riding .
geographically , the riding of T 茅 miscamingue is in northwestern Quebec , on the border with Ontario .
naturally , we do a great deal of trade .
we have a very serious transportation problem .
there is all sorts of regulations , and trucking regulations in particular .
but this does not mean we should give the federal government the power to decide what would be best for these people .
hopefully , the provinces will step up negotiations to improve interprovincial trade , in the interest of businesses , individuals , workers and ultimately consumers .
in some cases , it is easier to trade with a foreign country , and the United States in particular , that between two Canadian provinces .
everyone agrees improvements are required , but certainly not along the lines of the proposals contained in the bill before us today , as it would not be in keeping with the amending formula Quebec wants , it would not give it a veto .
on the other hand , it would enable the federal government to avail itself of this means to help itself to more and more power in the area of interprovincial trade .
in the end , this would lead , once again , to a greater centralization of powers .
for these two very valid reasons , we cannot support this bill .
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to speak to Bill C - 203 .
the bill before us proposes to amend the powers of the government to enforce the agreement on internal trade .
under Bill C - 203 unanimous consent from the provinces will no longer be required to reduce interprovincial trade barriers .
internal trade is an area of great interest to me .
my background is in small and medium size business .
my family have been historically involved in small and medium size business .
our family and our region in Atlantic Canada prospered under more liberalized trade both with other Canadians and with people around the world .
currently 20 % of our national income and over 1.9 million Canadian jobs are created by trade among provinces and territories .
trade between the provinces totalled $ 314 billion in 1995 alone .
recognizing that internal trade in Canada is a vital part of our economy , I am distressed that since the internal trade agreement was negotiated and implemented it has received very little attention and even less leadership from the government .
working harder to eliminate interprovincial trade barriers might stop or at least slow the recent increase in the unemployment rate .
Canadian consumers , Canadian taxpayers and Canadians looking for work are paying the price for inaction on reducing internal trade barriers .
the initiative on the internal trade agreement was brought forward by the former Conservative government in partnership with the first ministers of the day .
in 1987 the partners reached an agreement in principle to negotiate an agreement on internal trade .
in the spring of 1993 negotiations began with a deadline of June 1994 .
unfortunately this agreement has not had the effect its originators had envisioned for it .
the current agreement is fundamentally flawed .
there continue to be differing rules for a wide range of goods and services and specifications for things as ludicrous as the colour of margarine to the standards that trades people must meet in neighbouring provinces .
self - governing professional groups have erected qualification and certification barriers that prevent mobility of the workforce between provinces .
the current agreement does not cover the $ 50 billion public procurement market involving municipalities , universities , schools and hospitals .
a recent proposal to open this market was vetoed by the British Columbian government .
since the agreement contains no enforcement mechanism , when a province wishes to break the agreement it can do so without fear .
the Liberal Party has in its past fought free trade .
now it cannot get enough of it .
this is not an issue of partisan politics as members of each party recognize the importance of bringing down these barriers and ensuring that we further grow the Canadian economy through liberalized trade .
since the Liberals negotiated the agreement they have continued to pass legislation that increases barriers to internal trade .
this represents a potential $ 350 million loss to Canadian taxpayers because of his ineptitude at the time he championed Bill C - 29 .
the former minister for international trade , now the defence minister , cautioned the member for York West in a letter dated February 23 , 1996 .
he told the minister " Bill C - 29 could have many adverse implications for Canadian trade without compensating environmental benefits '' .
the government is guilty of creating more internal trade barriers within the country , not eliminating them .
bill C - 29 created internal trade barriers and is inconsistent with our current international trade minister ' s philosophy du jour espousing the benefits of liberalized trade .
now the minister ' s trade policy contained in Bill C - 29 has brought the lawsuit from Ethyl Corporation .
it is one of three lawsuits now against the Canadian government from foreign companies under chapter 11 provisions of NAFTA .
not only did the government introduce Bill C - 29 but it also tried to push taxation barriers on the Atlantic provinces through the implementation of the HST .
tax - in prices would have done more to create internal trade barriers and would have cost more jobs in Atlantic Canada .
the motion put forth by the member for Lakehead is headed in the right direction as it asks for trade barriers to be reduced .
it has enabled the House to have a lively debate on the important issue of internal trade .
the motion on its own is too simplistic to completely address the barriers surrounding internal trade .
i fear that what is needed is leadership from the government on an issue that is all too important to be downsized .
the government has shown a propensity to downsize and offload responsibilities to the provinces in the race to fiscal responsibility .
we cannot offload or downsize leadership .
that is what I fear has happened with this important issue of internal trade .
furthermore , the motion asks the government to unilaterally change the internal trade agreement without consultation with the provinces .
it is this type of federalism that the Official Opposition has used at times to divide Canadians while our party , the PC Party , is trying hard to unite Canada .
the PC Party believes it is time to deal with this problem of internal trade barriers with a holistic approach .
the jobs at stake are simply too important for the federal government to sit on the sidelines .
we believe that free internal trade can be negotiated co - operatively with the provinces .
earlier this spring my party proposed making internal trade an integral part of something we call the Canadian covenant .
under the Canadian covenant the PC Party proposed forging a new and lasting federation with a new level of co - operation between the federal government and the provinces .
besides health care and post - secondary education , the covenant would have focused on interprovincial trade .
we support the establishment of a commission to regulate and enforce the rules of interprovincial trade .
we need to negotiate with the provinces to harmonize provincial standards in areas of corporate and business registrations , professional or occupational certification so that the costs of doing business in this country are not increased but in fact are reduced .
the PC also supports strengthening internal trade through the transportation procurement provisions .
in closing , interprovincial trade like international trade is vital to our economy .
the current government has focused too little time on improving trade conditions right here at home .
the Canadian Chamber of Commerce estimates that a 10 % increase in interprovincial trade will create 200,000 very necessary and important jobs for Canadians .
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to rise and speak on Bill C - 203 , a bill to amend the Agreement on Internal Trade Implementation Act .
i would like to congratulate the member for Lakeland for this initiative .
i would like to congratulate our government as well for making some early moves in the right direction .
as the parliamentary secretary indicated , more needs to be done , but I am very happy that we have started the process .
if we look at it from the point of view of economic efficiency , it does seem somewhat ironic that as we are breaking down barriers to trade internationally , we still do have some barriers to trade within our own country .
within that context I wonder if we could talk briefly about the brewing industry .
the brewing industry and the location of brewing plants in Canada has been one of those issues within the context of the internal trade agreement that has received some profile and some attention .
in my riding of Etobicoke North I have two very large breweries , a big Molson brewery and a big Labatt brewery .
i have many dealings as a result of that with the brewing industry .
they tend to have huge plants and they capitalize on some tremendous economies of scale .
in Canada the brewing industry has developed somewhat differently .
as I understand it , the reason that has evolved is that many provinces - including I suspect the province of Alberta , but I do not know that for certain - but various provinces have insisted that for the national breweries to do business in their province , they have restricted transport movements of beer .
it really has meant that the brewing industry has been required to set up brewing plants in very many of the provinces .
presumably some of the major breweries have established plants in Alberta .
again , I do not have those facts in front of me .
if the barriers to internal trade are removed for the brewing industry , it would undoubtedly mean that some of the smaller plants across the prairies , in British Columbia , in the maritime provinces and in Ontario would shut down and a lot of the production would be consolidated into megaplants .
i wonder if the hon. member for Lakeland would see that as a positive step and whether he would support it .
the Deputy Speaker :
if the hon. member for Lakeland speaks now , he will close the debate .
the hon. member for Lakeland .
Mr. Leon E . Benoit :
Mr. Speaker , I will respond to some of the issues which were brought up by the members who spoke .
i do not have much time obviously to spend on the response to any one particular member .
i will start by responding to the questions posed by the hon. member for Etobicoke North .
he asked what would happen to some of the smaller breweries if barriers to internal trade were removed .
he asked about Alberta specifically .
if the member wants to refer to Alberta , it would be important for him to know that the province of Alberta has led the movement to remove barriers to internal trade .
unilaterally it has made many of the changes which will be and should have been put in place by a completed agreement on internal trade .
Alberta has done it unilaterally because it feels that this issue is important to Albertans .
that is what my private member ' s bill would do .
it would lead to the completion of the agreement .
members who have called it simplistic obviously have not read it and thought it through .
it is simple .
it is a simple amendment , but it is not simplistic and it will do the job .
in terms of the breweries , many successful breweries are in fact micro - breweries , smaller breweries .
i cannot say for sure that some would not close down as a result of removing barriers .
however , every province , each territory and the federal government , when they signed the agreement on internal trade agreed that there would be a net benefit to the people of each and every province .
that brings me to the comments made by the Bloc member .
he was concerned that Quebec would lose its veto within the formula which would remove the unanimous consent requirement and put in place the consent of at least seven provinces having at least 50 % of the population .
his concern is completely unfounded .
in fact , the Government of Quebec signed the agreement on internal trade .
it agreed to a step by step process to complete the agreement .
all my bill would do would be to allow for the completion of the agreement on internal trade .
the concerns put forth by the hon. Bloc member are completely unfounded because Quebec has already agreed to it , as has every other province and territory in the country .
furthermore , I believe that Bloc members supported the implementation agreement which was introduced in 1995 and passed in 1996 .
this nonsense about Quebec losing its veto is completely unfounded .
it has already expressed the desire to have this agreement completed and that is all my bill would do .
it would put in place a more realistic formula for approval for each step in completing the agreement on internal trade .
the reactions of government members have been very vague in some ways .
however , they did say they were concerned because the agreement on internal trade was signed by all governments in Canada , so how could the federal government alone make this amendment .
i would ask the parliamentary secretary if the government has even attempted to consult with the provinces and the territories to make this change or a change like this .
the government has far more resources than I have in terms of coming up with a way of doing it .
i believe it will work , as do members of these institutions who have studied the issue in some depth .
they agree it will work .
i do not believe it is simplistic .
i believe it is simple .
the concerns the government has expressed are completely unfounded .
i will use some quotes from Liberal ministers in the last government to back that up .
one is from Alan Toulin , writing in The Financial Post , October 25 , 1996 .
he referred to the minister from Edmonton West hoping for agreement on internal trade in electricity .
she also raised the possibility that Ottawa would use its constitutional powers to manage the country ' s economic union .
that would mean a more active federal government , a role in bringing about deregulation for that minister and the Minister of Industry .
on February 25 , 1997 the Minister of Industry spoke to a group of Edmonton small business people at a small business conference .
he said that from his point of view it would soon be time for the federal government to consider alternative strategies .
to say that he was disappointed , angry or frustrated is not only how he felt but an understatement .
being this far along into the agreement with so little progress to show indicated to him that it was certainly time to re - examine the strategy .
i will close with that .
i had several quotes from constitutional experts .
i would be glad to table them if I am requested to do so .
i thank members for their input .
if government members do not believe my bill is the best way to go in this regard , I encourage them to come up with their own and I will support it wholeheartedly .
the Deputy Speaker :
employment INSURANCE
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , on October 24 , 1997 , I questioned the Minister of Human Resources Development about the fact that the matter of the use made of the surplus of billions of dollars in the employment insurance fund should be included on the agenda of the next federal provincial conference .
since then , there has not been a peep out of the federal government .
the minister told us that the agenda was not his responsibility , it was the Prime Minister ' s .
today , we have reached that point in the autumn when - and we can see it at the InfoCentres - in Shawinigan they are getting calls from all those who are dissatisfied with the employment insurance reform .
our riding offices are systematically flooded with calls from people who say they can no longer get through .
in this wonderful federal system , it used to be that each Canada employment centre could provide answers to those it served .
through some incredible coincidence , it was decided to centralize everything in Shawinigan , in the Prime Minister ' s riding , and nothing works any more .
there is no one to answer the phone .
people call and call , but the line is always busy .
this is example of the contempt shown by the Liberal government , which did not heed the message sent by the public during the last federal election .
several Liberal MPs from the maritimes lost their jobs here .
they were replaced by New Democrats or Conservatives because the public sent a clear message to the government that the employment insurance issue had to be reconsidered .
they know that the new program is not a guarantee of employment , but a guarantee that they will have increasingly less money when they find themselves between jobs .
they want to know whether the government is prepared to lower the requirement of 910 hours of work for first - time contributors , such as graduating students or women who re - enter the labour market .
would it be possible to lower this requirement to a more reasonable figure , so that people will not give up ?
would it be possible to change the fact that , at the end of every 20 weeks of collecting employment insurance , people will see their benefits diminish by 1 % ?
the clock is not set back to zero .
this means that in three years , seasonal workers will find themselves with 50 % , while a person who lives in another region and who does not have to rely on employment insurance on a regular basis will get 55 % .
is there any possibility that the federal government can promise to put this issue on the agenda at the first ministers ' conference that will be held in December , as requested by the Quebec premier and the other provincial premiers last summer ?
that would tell us something about this government ' s ability to show compassion .
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to respond to the hon. member ' s question by reminding him , and the Minister of Human Resources remarked on this recently , that the last federal budget and the main estimates already contain a great deal of information on the employment insurance account .
that said , there is no great mystery regarding the employment insurance account reserve .
a reserve is necessary since it makes it possible to apply more stable premium rates throughout the economic cycle , thus making it possible to avoid increasing them in a recessionary period .
in addition , the reserve makes it possible to ensure that there are sufficient funds to pay benefits when they are most necessary .
let us recall for a moment what happened in the last recession .
a $ 2 billion surplus in the Employment Insurance Act turned into a $ 6 billion deficit in two years and it was necessary to increase premiums by 30 % in what was already a difficult time for job creation .
that is no time to increase premiums .
consequently the government believes that it is wise to establish a reserve in the employment insurance account .
the size of the reserve varies continually .
it increases and decreases depending on the rate at which benefits are paid out .
the reserve is currently estimated to contain some $ 12 billion .
however , this amount is to be reviewed and the government will soon be announcing its decision in this regard .
it should be remembered that the funds are kept in an account in anticipation of future expenditures that might be incurred under the program .
the interest is credited to the employment insurance account .
as indicated in the main estimates for 1997 - 98 , interest this year totalled $ 345 million .
the employment insurance premiums of workers and employers make it possible to provide income protection .
that is very important for persons who unexpectedly lose their jobs .
the Deputy Speaker :

Friday , November 21 , 1997
the House met at 10 a.m.
prayers
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i wonder if you would ask for unanimous consent that we might table a committee report on Bill C - 7 .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the House has heard the request for unanimous consent .
is there unanimous consent ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
routine PROCEEDINGS
committees OF THE HOUSE
CANADIAN HERITAGE
Mr. Dennis J . Mills ( Broadview - Greenwood , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the first report of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage .
government ORDERS
telecommunications ACT
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Thornhill .
by November 30 , of this year , Canada will have deposited an Instrument of Acceptance in Geneva signifying Canada ' s commitment to one of the most important trade agreements of the 21 st century , the agreement on basic telecommunications .
as of January 1 , 1998 this agreement will open a global market of $ 880 billion to Canadian telecommunications companies .
Canadian telecom service providers and Canadian telecom manufacturers are the best in the world .
now they will have the opportunity to connect the world and build a new global information society by bringing Canadian ingenuity to the world .
canada was a key participant in the drive to liberalize the world ' s telecommunication markets .
at the end of the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations that established the World Trade Organization , it was recognized that there were serious gaps in the services component of the WTO and the General Agreement on Trade and Services covered many service sectors but did not cover some fundamental business enablers such as financial services or basic telecommunications .
after two years of negotiations an agreement was reached on February 15 , 1997 .
on that date , 69 countries with over 90 % of the world ' s telecom revenues agreed to liberalize their markets for the provision of telecommunication services .
as a result of the agreement on basic telecommunications , the ABT , there will now be multilateral rules for trade and investment in basic telecommunication services .
local and long distance telephone , cellular , data transmission and satellite services will be open to competition .
furthermore , Canada will now be able to resort to the WTO dispute settlement process should Canada ' s trading partners not implement their obligations to open their markets to Canadian companies .
each of the countries participating in the agreement has made specific commitments , setting out the terms and conditions under which foreigners are permitted to supply basic telecommunication services in their market .
for example , Canadian firms will now have full access to the U.S. market for the provision of basic telecommunication services .
the use of reciprocity tests by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission will be severely curtailed .
Canadian companies will be able to provide local telephone services in the member states of the European Union and in Japan .
all of Canada ' s major developing country trading partners have committed to allowing foreign competition into their markets and to allowing foreign investment of between 25 % and 49 % .
besides making market access commitments , the countries participating in the agreement on basic telecommunications have committed to follow the GATS most favoured nation national treatment and transparency provisions .
countries will no longer be able to treat one country ' s telecommunication services providers better than another .
this means that Canadian companies will be able to compete on a level playing field with other foreign companies in international markets .
for telecommunication services where countries have made market access commitments , countries will have to treat foreign companies in exactly the same way as they treat local companies .
so , a Canadian company in the European market will be treated the same way as a European company .
finally , any relevant changes to government policies , regulations or administrative guidelines must be notified to the WTO .
as well , countries must respond promptly to requests for information on telecommunications policies and regulations .
no longer will Canadian companies be stymied by walls of obscure foreign red tape when trying to enter telecommunications markets abroad .
this means that measures affecting trade in telecommunications services must be administered in a reasonable , objective and impartial manner .
licensing requirements and technical standards must be based on objective and transparent criteria and must not be more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service .
Canadian telecom companies will be able to obtain interconnection with local telephone companies in foreign markets under non - discriminatory rates , terms and conditions .
perhaps most important , all participating countries must establish independent regulatory bodies which are separate from and not accountable to the local telephone company .
in addition to opening foreign markets to Canadian telecommunications service providers , the agreement on basic telecoms will result in the world - wide market of $ 800 billion , which means the market will double or triple in size over the next 10 years .
this will generate a new demand for the products of Canadian telecommunications manufacturers as telecom operators around the world prepare for a new global environment of open markets and competition .
companies such as Nortel and Newbridge as well as dozens of small and medium size companies from Newfoundland to British Columbia have carried the Canadian reputation for high quality , competitively priced telecommunications equipment .
now this reputation should earn them a healthy share of this dynamic and expanding market .
Canadian manufacturers will also benefit from the recently concluded information technology agreement .
under the provisions of the ITA , tariffs on information technology products including computers semiconductors and telecommunications equipment will be eliminated by the year 2000 .
this means that a market of $ 500 billion will become tariff free and will allow Canadian manufacturers to compete abroad on the basis of their products and their prices .
they will be free from the market distorting effects of tariffs .
this government has promised to create jobs for Canadians and to make Canada a cornerstone of the global information society .
in successfully negotiating the GATS agreement on basic telecommunications , we have done both .
Canadian telecom service providers will launch into newly opened markets and Canadian telecom manufacturers will find that the demand for their products will double or triple over the next 10 years .
new opportunity translates into jobs for Canadians and a chance for Canadians to make their mark on the global information society of tomorrow .
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to speak on behalf of this bill .
i believe it is good for Canadian businesses and consumers , including those in Thornhill .
those worthy objectives warrant support of this bill .
the overwhelming goal of this government is to connect Canadians , to make Canadians and Canada the most connected country in the world and to ensure that Canadians have access to the information highway and the new economy it supports .
many steps have been taken .
this legislation brings forward the General Agreement on Trade and Services , GATS , which is the Agreement on Basic Telecommunications , ABT .
the legislation before us implements the terms and the provisions of those agreements .
i met recently with the the economic development officer for the town of Markham .
he told me that Markham considers itself a high tech capital of Canada .
the critical mass of companies in knowledge based industries is unsurpassed in this country .
the critical mass is some 700 companies .
i believe , on further exploration , people would find that many of those companies are involved in or are supporting the telecommunications industry which is finding its hub , its strong base , not only in Thornhill but throughout Ontario .
i can also say that I have met with the director of education for the York region board of education .
as well , I have met with the chair and the director of education of the York region separate school board .
i am pleased to report on the interest that students and their boards of education have shown in the government ' s SchoolNet program .
in fact , not only is there interest in ensuring that all the schools in Thornhill are connected , the program of having computers in schools is already firmly connected in the York separate school boards .
they have established a centre where old computers are refurbished .
to date over 400 computers have been distributed through the York region separate school board system as a result of the program of the Ministry of Industry which assists schools to participate in the program and the students to have access to the computers .
i know that the York region board of education is also very interested in participating in this program .
there is a need for our students to be educated and have those skills which will lead them to the jobs of the future .
this legislation will give Canadian business access to an $ 880 billion industry worldwide .
canada is at the forefront .
we are leaders in this technology .
i believe that opening competition in telecommunications services is not only an important part of the strategy which this bill provides , but we know that it is the best and the fastest way to build the infrastructure for a knowledge based economy .
the way to do that is through open competition .
we know that Canadians can compete and can also lead the world .
by creating the best environment for electronic commerce Canada can and will continue to be a world leader in this emerging field , generating increased investment in electronic networks and growth in such areas as electronic transmission , multimedia products and on - line services .
the OECD conference will be an excellent opportunity for Canadians to learn more about what Canada is doing , what opportunities there are for them and also about the impact on consumers .
the legislation before us today is a necessary step toward giving our telecommunications service companies the keys they need to the world market .
it is my hope that this bill will be received and unanimously supported by everyone in this House .
i believe it is in the interests of Canadian businesses , it is in the interests of Canadian consumers , it is in the interests of all in Canada who have an interest in economic prosperity and job creation .
i know that the people of Thornhill would want to see this bill passed expeditiously and implemented .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have listened to the hon. member and certainly there are parts of this bill which we can support .
perhaps overall it will improve the system .
however , one of the things that really concerns us is something which has confounded Canadian business , especially the telecommunications business , and that is that this bill confers additional powers of jurisdiction to the CRTC .
Canadian business is asking the government to get out of its face and let it do business .
we see sections of this bill which enable the government , via the CRTC , to get more into the face of Canadian business .
i would like the hon. member to comment on this , please .
Ms. Elinor Caplan :
Mr. Speaker , one of the things that this bill actually in the specific agreement excludes is broadcasting .
one of the reasons for that was the concern of this government to ensure the protection of Canadian culture .
in all agreements that have dealt with trade , we have made sure that culture was off the table and excluded , and the CRTC has been an important instrument in ensuring that Canadian culture has been protected and that industries know the rules .
while the CRTC , like any other institution , is imperfect , certainly we always must remain vigilant to ensure that Canadian culture is protected at the same time as our industries are encouraged to participate in a competitive environment and play on the world stage in a way that will create jobs and prosperity for Canadians .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the comments from the hon. member from the Liberal party .
the unfortunate aspect of it is that in Nova Scotia we saw recently the provincial government giving $ 12 million to AT & T to compete head on with our local phone company , MT & T .
i know my colleagues in the Reform Party do not like the idea of people on welfare and people collecting EI , but I am sure they would be quite adamant that huge rich multinational companies come into areas of the maritimes and literally coerce the provincial government into giving them money in order to set up shop to the detriment of workers and the company and management already there .
can she give assurances to this House today that this bill , or the agreements to these bills after the OECD , will not add to the detriment of working people already in those communities ?
as well , at the same time she talks about education for children , need I remind this House that it was this government that cut education funding to the Atlantic provinces and across this country to the tune of billions of dollars .
Ms. Elinor Caplan :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to respond to the member .
i believe that Canada and Canadians will benefit .
we will benefit in two very specific ways .
the agreement opens up a world market of $ 880 billion to Canadian telecom companies which are among the best in the world and which can compete .
that will mean more jobs and better jobs for people right across this country .
i believe that is what competition will do .
i believe we will see that right across this country and hopefully every region will see those benefits .
Canadian telecom services providers will also benefit from new markets on an equal footing with local and foreign competitors and Canadian telecom manufacturers will find a new demand for their state of the art products as new and exciting telecom operators around the world prepare for global markets which are open and competitive .
on the answer to the question on students , I made the point that this government is doing what it can in a very positive way to ensure the students have access to computer technology , supporting provinces in their local initiatives , and working directly with school boards to ensure the students have access to computers and the skills they need so that they will be able to take advantage of those new jobs in the future .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie ( Louis - H 茅 bert , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is with great interest that I take part in this debate on Bill C - 17 , an act to amend the Telecommunications Act and the Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act .
telecommunications in Canada are in constant evolution .
the standard communication networks are giving way to new technologies .
obviously , these new means of transmission through technological development also contribute to the globalization of trade .
in fact , state of the art communication services and technologies are leading to multiplication of trade outside the country .
this new context presents a daunting challenge for Canada , that of maintaining its international competitiveness , despite the threats to its traditional industry share of investments .
the disappearance of technologies associated with natural monopolies and the restructuring of telecommunications and broadcasting activities to meet global , rather than national , requirements , calls for a reform of government policies .
these must now set out new ground rules for telecommunications and broadcasting corporations .
the disappearance of the traditional boundaries between telecommunications , cable television and informatics heralds the convergence of information transmission services on a single information highway .
we are witnessing the disappearance of the natural monopoly with the introduction of indirect competition , which has come about primarily through the new transmission technologies ; direct competition will require complete deregulation .
in 1993 , international communications traffic reached 47.7 billion minutes .
this represents barely nine more minutes per person on a global scale , but 46 minutes if high income earning nations alone are considered .
the impact of this bill on the everyday lives of citizens will take the form of new job creation , since our industry is strong and can easily compete internationally .
according to the Federal Communication Commission , another advantage will be an 80 % drop in international telephone rates in a few years .
this bill therefore has two objectives .
the first is to bring Canadian legislation into line with Canada ' s international undertakings as a signatory to the February 1997 World Trade Organization ' s services agreement , commonly known as GATT .
the agreement takes effect January 1 , 1998 . The bill ' s second objective is to bring Canadian legislation into line with the new competitive context in the telecommunications industry .
with this bill , the government is giving more powers to the CRTC , as can be seen in sections 1 , 2 , 3 and 7 . Among its many powers , the CRTC will be able to issue telecommunications licences and to suspend or revoke a licence for non - compliance with the act .
as for section 46.6 ,
it provides for the implementation by the CRTC of a contribution mechanism , because the CRTC itself recognizes that a contribution fund must be created to provide services in regions where it is more expensive to do so .
this provision gives the CRTC legal authority to do this .
the fund will compensate the companies offering basic services for their actual costs .
the Bloc Quebecois believes there is an urgent requirement to design a reliable and transparent mechanism for supporting companies and their customers in regions where costs are higher .
with the new powers provided the CRTC under this bill , the government is ensuring that practices in Canada are in line with those abroad so that a clear and consistent process can be created to identify the players in the industry .
we hope that the CRTC will now be able to implement rules that guarantee a level playing field for everyone .
as for the Minister of Industry , he now has authority under sections 4 and 5 of this bill to issue licences for international submarine cables , and , under section 8 , to certify that telecommunications equipment is in compliance with Canadian standards .
it is also important to note that the government is responsible for the full implementation of Canada ' s telecommunications policy .
it must ensure that all Quebeckers and all Canadians have equal access to telecommunications services .
that is why the Minister of Industry has the power to issue directives to the CRTC .
finally , the Bloc Quebecois agrees in principle with this bill , which flows naturally from the telecommunications agreement .
the Bloc Quebecois believes that hearings are urgently required to define what is meant by basic telecommunications services .
what does the " affordability " of a basic service mean ?
for some , affordability is determined on the basis of the subscriber penetration rate , but this is not a significant measurement because it does not take the fall in the standard of living into account .
therefore , the Bloc Quebecois thinks there is an urgent need to determine what low income customers can afford to pay for this basic telecommunications service .
despite the liberalization of telecommunications , it is essential that these services remain affordable for everyone .
there is great public concern , and rightly so , about the impact of this on the release of personal information .
this bill opens the door to globalization in the area of communications , and the government has still not fulfilled its commitment regarding a law to protect personal information in the private sector and at the networking level .
the population is still waiting , and there may be very serious incidents if the government waits too long .
as far as privacy is concerned , both for the private and the public sector , and where linkage is concerned as well , Quebec is proud to have been both a laboratory and a model for this .
i am therefore suggesting , on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois , that the federal government do its homework and follow the example of the Quebec legislation which protects both privacy and linkage .
particularly after passage of this bill , data linkage must be protected by legislation .
in April 1997 , the parliamentary human rights committee called for adoption of legislation , but we are still waiting .
on September 18 , 1996 , the Minister of Justice promised it by the year 2000 , but we are still waiting .
also related to privacy , it appears that the new technologies will develop telephone communications between individuals and not places .
these new satellite technologies will be able to locate individuals wherever they are .
thus this becomes a control over individuals and society .
we must go beyond the industrial aspect and an analysis of profitability , for it is appropriate as well to question the values our society wishes to preserve .
in the field of telecommunications , the public is often left out of the debate , given the complexity of the subject , and I can understand this .
that is why the advisory committee on the information highway suggested , not all that long ago , that the federal government strike a national advisory committee on access reporting to the Ministers of Industry and Heritage and mandated to give advice on the new requirements relating to access and services deemed essential in a knowledge - based society .
this advisory committee should be composed of equal numbers of members from industry and the non - profit sector .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have a couple of comments that concern us about this bill .
i get back to the point that business has been wanting government to get out of its face and just let it do its business .
i find this particularly offensive when appointed bureaucrats are going to have such powers to wield over free enterprise business .
our party supports free enterprise .
the other comment I have is on the financial fund that is being set up .
this is another opportunity for the government to expand its patronage program .
it is going to give Liberal MPs simply another avenue to dole out government grants to Liberal - friendly businesses in their ridings .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
hon. members , there are a number of members who have indicated that they would like to respond in questions and comments .
if there are a number of people who indicate an expression of interest to comment , I would ask all hon. members to keep their questions and their responses short so that we can get a bit more debate .
response .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie :
Mr. Speaker , naturally there are questions , but we are here in this House to follow the debate , to follow events and to ensure that the bill covers as many aspects as possible .
we cannot liberalize unless there is an organization with a set of rules .
this means we have to keep an eye out , because there are things to monitor .
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to congratulate my colleague from Louis - H 茅 bert on her speech this morning .
all the questions she raised on this bill are topical .
those interested parties we met and the public all said so . Her questioning meets the expectations of the general public .
i hope the Minister of Industry listened attentively to the questions raised by the member for Louis - H 茅 bert .
i would like to ask her about the importance and the scope of this institution in her opinion .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie :
Mr. Speaker , first , this is an area where we have a significant , even comfortable , lead over other countries .
a third of research and development is done in telecommunications and information .
in this area , we are in a good position .
there are , however , minor effects that are sometimes not mentioned in this House .
i recently visited a school for severely handicapped children where the children have access to the Internet .
this is one instance of what a bill such as this can do for us , if we have an information highway across the country .
rural communities that sometimes lack services because of their remoteness and because of the cost will no longer be isolated .
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I hear talk in the House today about liberalizing trade , liberalizing this , liberalizing that .
when I hear the word liberalizing , I hear bigger government .
when I hear the word liberalizing , I hear steroids for the CRTC .
when I hear liberalizing , once again I hear bigger government and I hear more pork .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie :
Mr. Speaker , in response to the concerns my colleague expressed , I say that they and we will ensure that everything is done as transparently and as fairly as possible .
Mr. Dick Harris :
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the time .
what my hon. member has just said , the word liberalizing really strikes terror in the hearts of fiscally conservative free enterprise reformers in this House .
whenever they hear the words financial fund put forward in a bill by the Liberals , they just shudder at the thought that the Liberals are going to establish another lever to pull and use to pay off their Liberal friends , in particular in the communications business under this bill .
i did not see the numbers on the fund , but given the history of the Liberal Party we can imagine that it is not pocket change .
we want to be sure that the Reform Party is on record as saying that we have always opposed grants and handouts to business , as the business council and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and every major business organization in the country have opposed grants and handouts to business .
however , the Liberals choose to ignore this and establish yet another fund to use in a patronizing way to friends of the Liberal Party .
that is a comment which I think is quite in order in this debate today .
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie :
Mr. Speaker , from what I have read , and I do not have any figures either , the purpose of the fund is to correct the differences between remote populations and small rural communities , on the one hand , and more developed centres , on the other hand , and equalize the price to some extent so they can all enjoy the same benefits .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :

in my opinion the yeas have it .
pursuant to Standing Order 45 , the division stands deferred until Monday , November 24 , 1997 at the ordinary hour of daily adjournment .
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , on a point of order .
following the request for a recorded division , I believe that you would find consent to further defer the recorded division on second reading of Bill C - 17 until the expiry of Government Orders , Tuesday , November 25 , 1997 .

there is not unanimous consent .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , on a point of order .
when you read the numbers off , I assumed it was with regard to a previous bill .
i do apologize .
i do give unanimous consent .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
for the sake of clarification , the Chair would ask that we back up and start over again .

Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , again , there has been a sharing of information with all the parties , but I would ask you to seek unanimous consent so that the Secretary of State for Parks Canada might table a technical amendment to Bill C - 7 .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is there unanimous consent ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
hon. Andy Mitchell ( Secretary of State ( Parks ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to move a technical amendment .
essentially we are making sure that both the French and the English versions are consistent .
i move :
that Bill C - 7 , in the preamble , be amended by replacing , in the French version , line 6 on page 1 with the following :
" flore , ainsi que les ressources naturelles exceptionnel "
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
its purpose is to give heritage status to one of Quebec ' s most spectacular regions - the whole Saguenay River - while also promoting tourism .
the consultation process which then took place resulted in the project being expanded to include the St. Lawrence .
several years went by between the time the idea first came up , in the early nineties , and the time when the House finally votes on the legislation .
the bill includes new and interesting points which had not been raised before and which do not all reflect ideas put forward by those behind the project .
let us not forget that the park will be jointly managed by the federal and provincial governments , through a committee on which both will be represented .
for the first time , Quebec will maintain ownership of the seabed .
Lawrence marine park , the two levels of government have come to an agreement whereby Quebec will maintain ownership of the seabed .
this is a good step and a good result .
as a member of Parliament , I took part in the consultation process and a great of representations had to be made .
i think there are significant elements in the whole Lower St. Lawrence region , from Trois - Pistoles to 脦 le aux Basques , which incidentally is one the far extremities that will not be directly included in the park but could be considered as part of a whole system .
i think that , in the future , we should take advantage of the fact that the federal government has not yet met its targets for the year 2000 and may have a hard time meeting them as far as marine areas are concerned .
what is interesting about this legislation is that , if passed , it will make it possible to develop the necessary infrastructures and for centres on both sides of the St. Lawrence River and the Saguenay River to have a really significant tourist accommodation capacity .
for the Lower St. Lawrence region at least , this will help give it a stronger position as a tourist region .
in that sense , this is very desirable .
before I conclude I would like to remind the federal government that it is essential to have a logical plan of action .
so , we should promote an equally open attitude at the international level and take on an advocacy and a leadership role in promoting strict and stringent environmental rules to ensure that our part of North America is at the forefront and can provide this product .
there is nothing worse in the tourist industry than to offer a product that loses its appeal .
when a park like this one is established , it should be for 10 , 20 , 30 , 50 or even 100 years , and that is what we are trying to negotiate .
that is what will be happening in Kyoto for instance and in the ongoing negotiation process regarding environmental rules .
this has to be the basis for the federal government ' s position .
i will conclude by saying that establishing this park is a good thing , it is the result of an innovative approach that leaves the ownership of the seabed to Quebec , it was made possible by the participation of the people of the Saguenay and was spearheaded by a person who believed that joint management from a position of equality was possible in Canada .
having Quebec and Canada deal on an equal footing can give interesting results and today we have this bill to prove it .
let us now look at adding to Canada ' s marine areas as well as setting a goal for the year 2000 , and I am sure you will find on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River all the support necessary to add to this beautiful new park .

statements BY MEMBERS
scouting
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , this morning the governor general and the chief scout of Canada conferred scouting ' s highest awards on 20 members of the scout family of Canada .
i know my colleagues on both sides of the House will join me in congratulating the recipients of these awards .
as the member of Prince George - Bulkley Valley I want to pay special tribute to my constituent Tyler Douglas Edward Mauro , age 11 , who was awarded the Jack Cornwell decoration .
this award is given to individuals who have undergone great suffering in a heroic manner .
well done , Tyler .
you have shown great courage and determination in the face of physical challenges .
you have truly lived up to the Scout promise and the Scout law .

RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE
Mr. Eug 猫 ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , last week I had the honour of hosting the visit of presidents and managers for Ronald McDonald homes across Canada as they met in Ottawa .
i also had the pleasure of welcoming them in the House of Commons .
Canadians are thankful for such an organization which provides a home away from home to families of children being treated in hospital for cancer and other life threatening illnesses .
these establishments make it possible for seriously ill children to have their families with them at a critical time in their lives .
staying in a Ronald McDonald House also gives families an opportunity to talk with other parents going through similar experiences .
i extend heartfelt thanks to all volunteers , employees and managers of Ronald McDonald Houses in Canada .
your compassion and devotion are a big help in times of trouble .

MATAP 脡 DIA RCM
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , over 250 people from the Matap 茅 dia RCM got together at a forum on economic recovery and job creation .
i wish to congratulate Claude Jacques , the forum ' s president , for targeting economic problems and encouraging 13 workshop leaders to present concrete solutions to job creation .
in the Matap 茅 dia RCM , gloom is giving way to action .
the residents of the Matap 茅 dia valley have decided to rely on ingenuity , inventiveness and steadfast solidarity .
many young entrepreneurs are urging us to focus on the year 2000 , on new challenges .
the future belongs to the bold .
the people of the Matap 茅 dia valley are taking the challenge .

the ENVIRONMENT
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , global warming is a problem that every person , every country and every level of government in the world must deal with .
i rise in the House today to tell of a success story .
Toronto ' s outstanding progress in reducing greenhouse emissions is a model for the world and something that the House should be aware of .
according to the UN affiliated International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives , metropolitan Toronto is the world ' s leader in fighting global warming .
it tops the list of 150 cities in cutting carbon dioxide output between 1990 and 1996 .
Toronto and its surrounding suburbs achieved cumulative reductions of 7.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide between 1990 and 1996 .
that is a 6 % cent reduction .
the reductions were achieved using a variety of measures including landfill gas recovery , recycling initiatives , energy efficient street and land lighting and community water conservation programs .
this experience should serve as model for other cities in Canada and the rest of the world , showing that we can cut harmful greenhouse gas emissions , save money and create jobs -

airports
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government is downloading small regional airports throughout the country .
two airports have already been turned over in my riding and now a third is on the federal hit list .
some of the biggest users of the Fort Nelson airport are the federal and provincial governments , forestry workers , water bombers and American tourists on their way to Alaska .
fort Nelson is in the northeast corner of B.C. next to the Yukon border and hundreds of kilometres from any other towns .
the people of Fort Nelson are going to referendum December 6 to vote on whether they can afford to take over the local airport .
the population is only 4,500 , a small town with a big heart .
yet the federal government wants the town to pick up the tab for an airport that runs a $ 400,000 annual deficit .
why is Fort Nelson being forced to assume the cost of operating its airport but other northern communities like Whitehorse , Watson Lake and Yellowknife are not ?

WYE MARSH WILDLIFE CENTRE
Mr. Paul DeVillers ( Simcoe North , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr. Bob Whittam , retired executive director of the Wye Marsh Wildlife Centre .
the Wye Marsh Wildlife Centre located in my riding is a non - profit organization committed to promoting an understanding of the vital role wetlands play within the environment .
Mr. Whittam , affectionately known as Mr. Wye Marsh , was recently honoured at a banquet attended by more than 300 family , friends and dignitaries .
he has been the driving force behind the Wye Marsh Wildlife Centre through good and bad times .
were it not for Mr. Whittam ' s leadership , it is quite doubtful that the Wye Marsh Wildlife Centre would have survived a cut in federal funding in 1984 .
i again thank Bob Whittam on behalf of all citizens of Simcoe North for his tireless dedication and commitment in contributing to the Wye Marsh Wildlife Centre ' s success .
have a good retirement , Bob .

youth EMPLOYMENT
Ms. Marlene Catterall ( Ottawa West - Nepean , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to announce that tomorrow , November 22 , the Minister of Industry will be opening in Ottawa West - Nepean the first youth employment info fair at Algonquin College .
all day young people will be able to see displays by government departments , non - governmental agencies and post - secondary institutions .
even one of our own pages , Mr. Craig O ' Brien , will help us out by talking about the pages program .
i hope young people will take the opportunity to turn out so they can find out what government , the community and business are doing to improve their chances of getting a good job .
they can see what we are doing to improve their opportunities for post - secondary education and get the information they need to create a better future for themselves .

APEC
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wish to inform the House of an APEC success story in my own riding .
on Wednesday , November 26 officials from Dongcheng district of Beijing City in China together with Maple Ridge entrepreneur Bill Stelmaschuk will sign an agreement to open a reciprocal trade office between the city of Maple Ridge in my riding and Dongcheng .
these offices will be the headquarters of China International Investment Ltd. of North America , a partnership between government and the private sector .
it will open up multimillion dollar investment opportunities for Canadian and Chinese entrepreneurs .
initial joint ventures include the construction of an indoor family entertainment complex , shipping container sales and leasing , computer sales and vehicle and heavy leasing equipment .
i ask the House to join me in congratulating Bill Stelmaschuk and the people of Dongcheng for demonstrating through their actions that the entrepreneurial spirit is indeed alive and well in Canada .

veterans
Mr. Robert Bertrand ( Pontiac - Gatineau - Labelle , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is no coincidence that the interest for Remembrance Day is increasing everywhere in Canada and that there are more and more people at the ceremonies .
it must be pointed out that Veterans Affairs Canada has decided to go modern and has developed an excellent web site .
the number of hits this year increased by 238 % .
during a two - week period , 23,000 Canadians had more than a million hits on the Veterans Affairs Canada web site and accessed various items such as the Books of Remembrance and Veterans Remember , a collection of stories and radio interviews with veterans .
this site seeks to promote young Canadians ' interest in our country ' s military history .
furthermore , last Tuesday , young people hired by STEM - Net in Newfoundland and Labrador launched a new digital series by SchoolNet on Canada at war .
it is most fitting that the House acknowledge all Canadians , young and old , who continue to help us pay tribute to Canada ' s veterans and recognize their achievements and sacrifices .

aboriginal YOUTH
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the historic systematic abuse of aboriginal youth by residential schools goes unanswered by this government .
an apology is due .
it appears that lawyers run the department , as this Liberal government has yet to say two simple words : " we ' re sorry '' .
every day this government remains content to allow the full weight of this horror to burn in the minds and hearts of the countless victims is another day this government shares responsibility for this acts of ritualized abuse .
aboriginal youth were torn from their families and communities .
their language , culture , customs and values were suppressed .
the wounds of this abuse are still open and now is the time for healing .
the royal commission clearly states that recognizing our mistake is the first step toward a new relationship based on mutual respect .
an apology from this government would be one small remedy that would begin the healing .
anything less is unconscionable , unforgivable and unacceptable .

royal COMMISSION ON ABORIGINAL PEOPLES
Mrs. Nancy Karetak - Lindell ( Nunavut , Lib . ) :
i am pleased that the federal government will respond to this report in the new year and equally pleased to be on the committee that will look at the government ' s response .
[ editor ' s Note :
member spoke in Inuktitut ]
there is no doubt that the work of the commission will influence aboriginal policy and I thank all those who participated in preparing this report for their valuable work .

QUEBEC ECONOMY
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond - Guiral ( Laval Centre , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , where have all the scarecrows gone ?
until last May , the members opposite were constantly making inflammatory statements on the economic consequences of political uncertainty in Quebec .
this fall , however , our scarecrows have stayed out of sight , strangely enough .
it is true that there is a lot of good news .
with the socioeconomic summit launched by Premier Bouchard , there is a tremendous rise in new investments all over Quebec . It is said that economic growth will be greater than in France , Germany , the United States , Italy and Japan .
in spite of the economic disaster handed down by the provincial Liberals and of enormous federal cuts , the Parti Quebecois government is continuing to put Quebec ' s economy and finances back on track .
this has sent our economic scarecrows into hiding .
could it be that they have decided to do like the birds and fly South ?

justice
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is restorative justice week .
true justice makes things right rather than lamenting what is wrong .
true justice cultivates strength rather than perpetuating failure .
i believe restorative justice could be a great part of the solution for our justice system in Canada .
restorative justice views crime as a violation of the victim in the community , not solely a violation of the state .
as a result , the offender becomes accountable to the victim and the community .
under our existing justice system , offenders seldom are required to realize the harm they have caused .
restorative justice confronts the perpetrators with the personal harm they have caused and requires them to pay reparation and make real amends to victims and the community .
restorative justice offers victims the opportunity to regain personal powers and allows them the time to become more involved with the justice system .
it also gives them the power that was taken away when the crime was committed .
in one word , restorative justice puts victims at the centre of the justice system where they should always have been .
restorative justice should be studied by this House as an alternative to the current way of thinking about crime and criminal justice in Canada .

integrated MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES INSTITUTE
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( London West , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Industry recently celebrated the opening of the National Research Council ' s newest research facility , the Integrated Manufacturing Technologies Institute .
this institute will eventually house 140 scientists , engineers , technicians and support staff and will further enhance London , Ontario ' s reputation as a leading centre of research and development in Canada .
research programs at IMTI will be aimed at keeping Canadian manufacturers at the forefront of technological innovation and advances needed in our highly competitive global economy .
these programs will continue to position Canada as a world leader in our future knowledge based areas of concern .
i congratulate the NRC on over 80 years of improving the lives of Canadians by performing and supporting relevant research and development .

peacekeeping
Mrs. Rose - Marie Ur ( Lambton - Kent - Middlesex , Lib . ) :
on behalf of all Canadians , I would like to wish these officers well on their journey .
the officers leaving today will replace a contingent of 15 other officers who will be returning to Canada from Bosnia in a few days .
we are grateful that the officers returning have safely accomplished their mission .
they can be proud of their work with the United Nations .
i would like to officially recognize the humanitarian efforts of these officers who have worked hard to restore peace and order in Bosnia , with a respect for internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms .
we know we can count on the professionalism of these Canadian police officers to continue to serve the UN well and support responsible police forces in Bosnia .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
canada POST
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it used to be said that nothing could stop the mail , neither rain nor snow , nor sleet nor hail , but this Liberal government has stopped the mail .
this minister will not take a stand and the postal strike is paralyzing the country at the absolute worst time of year .
Canadians want to get out their holiday parcels .
it is the busiest time of the year for many businesses and charities are suffering because the mail is not moving .
how many more days , how many more weeks or how many more months is this government willing to allow this strike to paralyze our country ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am amazed that a party that indicates it wants less government now wants government to get involved and interfere in the collective bargaining process .
i ask the opposition party to let the collective bargaining system work for Canadians and have no government interference .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , this government has this unflagging trust in this collective bargaining process , the process which has brought our post office four strikes in ten years and has not brought a resolution to this current dispute for seven months .
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am amazed that the opposition , a party that wants less government , wants government to move in right away and interfere with the collective bargaining process .
let the system work .
let both parties do what they are doing , sit down and come up with an agreement .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , charities are being hurt the worst .
take , for example , the Old Brewery Mission in Montreal , a homeless shelter .
it has had a $ 700,000 mail campaign for fund - raising stopped dead in its tracks by this strike .
they are facing debt and they are struggling to pay for the 1,200 meals that they deliver to the homeless each day .
this charity and the homeless that depend on it are paying the price for this government ' s inaction .
how many such causes is this Liberal government ready to sacrifice while it keeps making these lame excuses ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is hard to imagine this party criticizing the Minister of Labour for protecting the collective bargaining system in an attempt to gain short - term political gain .
shame on the opposition .
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , small and medium size businesses are the engine of this economy .
for weeks the effects of a mail strike have been looming over their heads .
now we are into the third day of a full - blown strike costing the economy hundreds of millions of dollars a day .
how many more millions of dollars will small businesses have to lose before this government legislates the post office back to work ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , under the collective bargaining system the parties have the right to strike .
it is unfortunate when we get to this point , but it is the right under part I of the Canada Labour Code and we must adhere to the laws of the land .
Mr. Jim Hart ( Okanagan - Coquihalla , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the minister continues to defend a system that history shows has failed .
four strikes in ten years .
there have been seven months of failed negotiations .
meanwhile , small and medium size businesses are losing millions of dollars during their busiest season , not to mention the collateral damage of lay - offs and lost jobs .
i will ask the minister again , when will the government come to its senses and order back to work legislation ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are going through a process , a process that has worked well for this country .
my colleague mentions the process and the number of strikes that have taken place .
over the last year , 94.5 % of the companies under the federal jurisdiction have been settled without a work stoppage .
in the seven months of this year , there have been fewer days lost than that .
* * *
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the acting Prime Minister .
the bad odour surrounding the Option Canada affair is getting worse .
this organization had nothing but a fake headquarters , its financial statements and minutes are mysteriously unlocatable , and its administrators mere figureheads .
all that we do know about this organization is that it is a creation of the Council for Canadian Unity .
can the Acting Prime Minister tell us how , under such conditions , Option Canada was able to receive $ 4.2 million in funding from the Minister of Canadian Heritage ?
hon. Andy Mitchell ( Secretary of State ( Parks ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this hon. member and hon. members from that party have asked this question over and over again in the House .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Junior Acting Prime Minister is not very well informed about the responses by the Minister of Canadian Heritage , because they are far from clear .
the Acting Prime Minister , the Minister of Canadian Heritage , the administrators of Option Canada , and those on the Council for Canadian Unity are unable to tell us why and how the money was used .
can we have an explanation of how it can be that all of these people involved to varying degrees with Option Canada have suddenly been struck with collective amnesia ?
hon. Andy Mitchell ( Secretary of State ( Parks ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , two years ago during the referendum in Quebec , the citizens of Quebec voted to stay in Canada .
this party has never been able to accept that verdict .
they continue to fight a battle of two years ago .
* * *
the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister .
canada ' s ambassador in environmental matters , John Fraser , added his voice to that of all environmental groups in denouncing the minor Regina agreement on greenhouse gases .
he calls on the federal government to honour its earlier agreements .
is the government committed to reviewing its position and agreeing to that proposed by the Quebec government , as its own ambassador of the environment is suggesting ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as the Minister of the Environment said here in the House of Commons , the government is currently consulting all interested parties in order to prepare Canada ' s position for the conference coming up in a few weeks .
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , what we want to know on this side of the House is whether the government is prepared to set the example , as it did in the case of the anti - personnel mines , and to sign the Kyoto agreement even though the United States and other countries might refuse ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as the minister said in this House , we intend to propose a position for Canada that reflects the best interest of the people of Canada and elsewhere .
this is what we will do at the conference in a few weeks .
* * *
tags
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government appears to be sticking by its decision to end the TAGS program in Atlantic Canada by May 1998 .
i want to ask the minister of human resources why the government persists in doing something that it knows will create a veritable explosion of legitimate and justifiable anger in so many Atlantic Canadian communities .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are conducting right now an important review of the post - TAGS situation .
i have asked one of my very senior and trusted officials to look into the situation .
this gentleman is meeting with the provinces , the fishermen , the associations and the communities .
we will be looking very carefully into the post - TAGS situation and the government will behave appropriately .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , talking about appropriate behaviour , I wonder if the minister could tell us why we have been able to access a document that shows that the human resources department , in collaboration with the RCMP , the PCO and Treasury Board , has hired a consultant , Stonehaven Productions , to train senior managers on how to deal with , and I quote : " life threatening , explosive , dangerous situations after the end of the TAGS program '' .
why is the government conspiring against the legitimate anger of its citizens and planning to end the TAGS program while going through the sham of this review , instead of changing its mind and doing the right thing ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am going to look at this very bizarre way of addressing the situation .
we are well aware of the situation in Newfoundland and in the maritime provinces and in Quebec as well .
this is why we have brought forward this important program for crisis and emergency situations .
we are conducting an important review of the post - TAGS situation and we will take the appropriate decisions .

marine ATLANTIC
Mr. Bill Matthews ( Burin - St.
Mr. Speaker , Marine Atlantic is presently phasing out its headquarters operation in Moncton , New Brunswick .
i would like to ask the government what guidelines or instructions it has given Mr. Morrison of Marine Atlantic in carrying out the relocation process and if indeed he has been instructed to relocate Marine Atlantic headquarters in Newfoundland and Labrador ?
Mr. Stan Keyes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
marine Atlantic is an important vestiture within the Atlantic community and Marine Atlantic serves our country well on the east coast .
i want to inform the hon. member that the file on Marine Atlantic is presently being examined by the Minister of Transport to look at all the permutations and possibilities for Marine Atlantic ' s location in Atlantic Canada .
Mr. Bill Matthews ( Burin - St.
Mr. Speaker , I am sure that the parliamentary secretary must realize that the only purpose for Marine Atlantic now is to provide a very important and essential service to Newfoundland and Labrador .
there are no other operations for Marine Atlantic .
i would like to ask the parliamentary secretary , has Mr. Morrison of Marine Atlantic been instructed to locate Marine Atlantic headquarters in Port aux Basques , Newfoundland , the centre of Marine Atlantic operations in Newfoundland and Labrador ?
Mr. Stan Keyes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am sure the hon. member can appreciate that no one is going to be directing anyone to do anything until all the discussion takes place , all the input is made from the various stakeholders and all the concerned entities who are affected by the Marine Atlantic organization are consulted so that a decision will be made in the best interests of east coast Canada , in the best interests of Marine Atlantic and the people it serves .
* * *
the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , we now know , courtesy of Premiers Klein and Tobin , the government ' s position on fossil fuel emissions that it is going to take to Kyoto .
it will be 1990 levels by the year 2007 .
why did the Prime Minister choose to whisper this to the premiers instead of informing the House ?
we cannot get the government ' s position in this House .
is it because there is going to be an economic hit of $ 33 billion ?
who is going to pay for this ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I think it is important that instead of relying on speculation and piecemeal press reports we await the development of a position that takes into account all the points of view on this issue .
the effort has been to develop a position which reflects all interests , and that is what we will do .
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is rather humourous and absurd that our prime minister ' s sole position is to produce less gas than President Clinton .
that is their whole goal over there .
however , it is tragic that in doing so they are prepared to accept the loss of 40,000 jobs , a lower standard of living and the destruction of some economic sectors .
again , who is going to pay for this position ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of the Environment has made it very clear that our intention is to bring to Kyoto a position which reflects Canadian interests in general .
we are consulting with all stakeholders .
the provinces are very much involved in this process .
at Regina , just 10 days ago , a conference was held to ensure that the position reflects their interests as well .
that is what we are going to do .
* * *
inmate SECURITY RATING
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Solicitor General .
on October 31 , 1997 , in a letter to the president of the Conseil des travailleurs et des travailleuses du Qu 茅 bec , Quebec ' s Solicitor General Jacques Chamberland indicated that a new inmate security rating scale was under development .
since we know that a process to review security ratings was initiated more than two years ago , can the minister tell us when the new policy will come into effect ?
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , in fact I have met with the president of the union on questions of safety very often .
we will be acting on those recommendations shortly .
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , in the same letter , the minister said that there was a level of danger and risk attached to working in Quebec ' s penal institutions .
how can the Solicitor General justify the fact that , in Donnacona , from December to March , outer towers may be unmanned after 8 p.m. , which means there will be no supervision outside ?
hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , these are penitentiaries and there is a safety question because they are facilities designed to deal with that .
that is the reason we have introduced a number of safety features , very successfully , having to do with ion scanners , detectors , two - way radios .
any number of safety features have been introduced lately and it is very important for the protection of our employees .
* * *
KREVER INQUIRY
Mr. Maurice Vellacott ( Wanuskewin , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , today Canada ' s foremost expert on the tainted blood scandal , Justice Horace Krever , submits his final report on this , the worst public health tragedy in Canadian history .
the current health minister is the very same minister who blocked Krever in the courts , withheld vital documents from Krever and obstructed Krever at every turn .
given the deplorable record of the Minister of Health in obstructing the Krever commission , how can Canadians have any faith that this minister will heed the recommendations in Krever ' s report ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member is profoundly wrong .
the Government of Canada went to the federal court at first instance in order to assert important principles having to do with findings of wrongdoing against former federal officials .
our position prevailed .
we were found to be right .
we then dropped out of the litigation and it went to the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada without our involvement .
the hon. member is wrong .
as to the Krever report , we have been awaiting it a long time and we look forward to receiving it today .
Mr. Maurice Vellacott ( Wanuskewin , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , forgive me for my scepticism on this matter .
two days ago on the floor of the House this minister could not even keep a straight face when he postured about keeping commitments with respect to Canadian health .
Randy Conners and a number of others have died .
these are precious people who have died while this minister obstructed Justice Krever .
given this health minister ' s obstructionist record , how can Canadians have any faith that he will implement Krever ' s recommendations ?
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , how will Canadians who are watching this performance have any respect for a political process when a member of Parliament refuses to accept fact and insists on trafficking in fiction ?
that is nonsense .
we did anything but obstruct the Krever commission .
we look forward to the report and as soon as we get it we will continue with his recommendations in our work of ensuring that the blood system is the best blood system in the world .
the Deputy Speaker :
i remind hon. members that it is useful for the Chair to be able to hear the questions and the answers .

canada POST CORPORATION
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister responsible for the Canada Post Corporation .
in spite of the minister ' s untimely statements that special legislation would be passed in case of a strike , it seems that the two sides are still negotiating and might reach a settlement in the next few days .
can the minister tell us about the progress made and will he reaffirm his commitment not to get involved in the postal conflict and let the two sides negotiate in good faith ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to inform the hon. member and the House that negotiations are continuing .
we hope they will continue through the weekend and that a negotiated settlement will be reached , so that by Monday all Canadians will get their mail .
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the threat of privatization is hanging over Canada Post like a dark cloud .
if the government has nothing to hide regarding this issue , will the minister tell us when he will release the full report prepared by TD Securities on Canada Post , in April ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , on several occasions , my predecessor , myself and other members of the government have clearly said that the government has no intention of privatizing the Canada Post Corporation .
as far as we are concerned , all necessary documents have been made public , as required .

the SENATE
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the prime minister has showed that he has finally had enough .
he raised the attendance bar for senators to 2.2 % , and Senator Thompson tripped over it .
does he have any intention of raising the Senate attendance bar even higher , say to 5 % , to 10 % or how about a mind boggling 20 % ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I see the Reform Party is endorsing the position taken with respect to Senator Thompson .
we appreciate its support .
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , getting kicked out of the Liberal caucus is more of a reward than a punishment .
now the senator does not need to fight any feelings of guilt for missing the caucus meetings while he is wasting away in Margaritaville .
the prime minister claims the right of appointing senators .
will he do Canadian taxpayers a favour and give senators who collect their salary but do not show up for work a dis - appoint ?
hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my hon. friend is asking for an amendment to the Constitution .
it is a very interesting suggestion .
i would say that hopefully if some day we have an elected Senate it will not be , as Reform requests , election for life but will also involve the potential of unelection through the decision of the public .
at least we know now that the hon. member has confirmed the position of another colleague of his when it came to policy .
the member for Athabasca said on another matter , and this applies here : " Our position is unimportant '' .
that is the Reform position on everything .

employment INSURANCE
Mr. Paul Cr 锚 te ( Kamouraska - Rivi 猫 re - du - Loup - T 茅 miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
everyone agrees that EI premium rates are much too high , and that a large percentage of premiums is diverted away from its primary purpose , which is the protection of unemployed workers .
what is the government waiting for to announce a significant reduction in EI premium rates ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I met the Minister of Finance several times this week .
i am very pleased to tell the House that rates will be reduced from $ 2.90 in 1997 to $ 2.70 on January 1 , 1998 , meaning that we are going to accelerate the process in order to introduce on January 1 , 1998 the rate we had forecast for 1999 .
this is the fourth year in a row that this government has lowered EI premium rates .
* * *
employment
Mr. John McKay ( Scarborough East , Lib . ) :
the economy is creating jobs at twice its normal rate .
yet not all Canadians are participating in this economic recovery .
the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 9.1 %
would the finance minister tell Canadians why this rate is so high while other parts of the economy are prospering .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the unemployment rate has come down substantially since we have taken office .
there is no doubt that the Canadian economy continues to feel the trauma of the recession of the early 1990 s .
given the kind of news the minister of human resources has just announced , every single year since we have taken office unemployment insurance rates have come down .
this represents a tax cut of $ 1.4 billion .
at the same time the unprecedented clean - up of the ballot sheet has led to a lowering -

APEC
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , British Columbia is very happy to host the APEC summit , but Canadians are not happy when trade is done at the expense of human rights .
some of the worst abusers of human rights are coming to British Columbia .
this issue has been swept under the red carpet .
we want to know whether the prime minister is going to publicly bring up the issue of human rights at the APEC Summit .
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
the government is helping to sponsor the people ' s summit which will be dealing with human rights and other issues of concern to the member and all Canadians .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Canadians are fed up with human rights being chatted with a whisper behind closed doors , as the prime minister has done before .
Canadians want this government to stand up to its convictions and talk about human rights publicly .
again , will the prime minister publicly debate and call for a public discussion on humans rights at the APEC summit ?
hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the member will probably know that in the case of Indonesia , the leader of the east Timorese people , Noble Peace prize winner Mr. Jos 茅 Ramos - Horta , last night on the National said : " Canada should welcome Indonesian President Suharto with dignity but also take a hard line on human rights .
they can have a face to face dialogue with him , firm but non - confrontational '' .
i would submit that is an indication of what we are trying to do .

aboriginal YOUTH
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on the anniversary of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples report to say shame on this Liberal government .
the minister of Indian affairs says they need yet more time to respond .
there has been enough time to read 50 compelling and damning pages of systematic and ritualized physical , sexual and emotional abuse of aboriginal children in residential schools .
my question is clear .
all else aside , will the government say two words to begin the healing , two words , we ' re sorry ?
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
i just want to report to him that there were 440 recommendations in the RCAP .
the report is not on the shelf .
rather it is one of the most important tools we have at our disposal .
what we are going to do is in the Speech from the Throne and the government will act as soon as possible .
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples report recommends that the Metis people of Canada have the right to be acknowledged under section 91 ( 21 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 .
will the Liberal government acknowledge support of this recommendation ?
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to remind the hon. member that the government should not table a response just for the fact of tabling a response .
we want to table the right response .
we are working with the provincial governments and the aboriginal peoples .
i will quote Mr. Phil Fontaine who said in the Calgary Herald " I am confident at least at this stage that the government is serious about doing something '' .

international TRADE
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade .
what will the government do to address the issue ?
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government is very concerned about activities going on across the border because trade has actually doubled over the last 10 years .
we are in the process of upgrading all our transporter areas so that the problem will be corrected .
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of International Trade .
having our exporters ' products checked for compliance at the border is a non - tariff trade barrier that has resulted in damaged products and mixed up orders .
some of the 53 - foot drop trailers have ten to a dozen drops on them .
all the products do not always get reloaded .
will the minister insist that a U.S. custom official or a USDA officer check for compliance at the point of delivery rather than at the border ?
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would dearly love to .
i could only tell my hon. friend we are aware that increased trade back and forth with the United States has brought on an additional burden at border crossings , and we are taking measures to correct it .

rights OF CHILDREN
Mr. Joe Jordan ( Leeds - Grenville , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , yesterday was National Child Day .
upon reflection this may explain some of the actions in the House yesterday .
research clearly shows that early and aggressive intervention to improve the quality of life of our young people pays huge dividends for the children , their families and society .
an hon. member :
when are you going to stop taxing them ?
Mr. Joe Jordan :
this may not be important to the Reform Party but it is important to Liberals .
could the minister outline to the House and indeed all Canadians , because I think Canadians care , what programs -
some hon. members :
sit down .
the Deputy Speaker :
the hon. Minister of Health .
hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , there is no question that early intervention is critical to children .
as chair of the national children ' s agenda -
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
the Deputy Speaker :
order , please .
it is difficult for the Chair to hear the answer .
there may not have been a question but there was a statement .
it is normal when a member gets cut off before the end of a statement that the minister gets to answer the statement .
i invite the hon. Minister of Health to resume his answer .
hon. Allan Rock :
Mr. Speaker , I was saying that it is obvious early intervention is crucial if we are to provide children with a future .
as the chair of the national children ' s agenda I am very much aware of that .
i can tell the hon. member of one initiative that we have in partnership with provinces and communities that is working very well .
it is called community action program for children .
every week 30,000 Canadian children in 750 projects in 500 communities across the country are the direct beneficiaries of volunteer hours spent with those kids to improve their lives .
that is just one example of what we can do for children .
* * *
aboriginal AFFAIRS
Mr. Mike Scott ( Skeena , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , Greg Twoyoungmen , chair of the Committee Against Injustice to Natives , has been scathingly critical of the department of Indian affairs in Alberta .
he has publicly highlighted the absolute failure of the minister to protect the interests of grassroots aboriginal people .
now we find the department of Indian affairs has blatantly tried to buy Mr. Twoyoungmen ' s silence by offering him a high paying job .
why is the department of Indian affairs engaged in a seedy underhanded attempt to buy off its critics ?
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the answer is that we are not doing such a thing .
* * *
research AND DEVELOPMENT
Ms. H 茅 l 猫 ne Alarie ( Louis - H 茅 bert , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Finance .
the Canadian effort in research and development is limited to a paltry 1.64 % of GDP .
for a long time , the Bloc Quebecois , in its platform , and other stakeholders have been calling for the government to gradually increase granting council budgets .
is the minister going to act on the requests made by the Canadian Consortium for Research and increase by 50 % his total investment in granting councils over the next four years in order to reduce the gap separating us from our main trading partners ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , if the member took a look at the previous budgets , she would see that there were cuts at the very beginning , but that we have since increased the budgets .
if there is enough flexibility , if finances allow it , we intend to continue along that line .

tags
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
how could the minister expect Canadians to take him seriously when he says that the government is working on plans to help out the affected communities after TAGS is finished and we know he is telling the RCMP and his own officials they should get ready for the fact that they will be doing nothing ?
the minister now has a copy of the leaked document before him .
will he explain why the government is making plans for a social disaster in fishing communities instead of preventing the end of assistance for fishing communities and the people in those areas ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have never asked the RCMP to do the sorts of things he said in his question .
i understand that some of our officials need some training to be able to cope with confrontational situations and to handle more difficult situations on an individual basis .
it has happened not only in relation to TAGS but across Canada .
this is the way it works .
our government is doing the right thing by conducting a review of the post - TAGS situation .
we are not particularly worried because we trust Canadians and we know Canadians behave properly all the time .

finance
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
he wants to and should be auditor for that board .
my question is for the Minister of Finance .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , that is not the auditor general ' s position .
in any event , the auditor general ' s position will be clarified .

telemarketing
Mr. Ian Murray ( Lanark - Carleton , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry .
Canadians have become alarmed at the victimization of vulnerable people by fraudulent telemarketers .
could the parliamentary secretary assure the House that the amendments introduced to the Competition Act will be effective in ending this deplorable practice ?
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , telemarketing scams are estimated to be in the $ 4 billion mark .
tough new measures have just been introduced in the House in Bill C - 20 . The bill will attack telemarketing scam artists .
the bill will crack down on criminals by amending the misleading advertising provisions of Canada ' s Competition Act .

CIDA
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the minister in charge of CIDA is mismanaging her department .
she is using budget cuts to absolve herself of her responsibility to ensure accountability at CIDA .
now more than ever CIDA needs the Aid Effectiveness Advisory Committee that it asked for in 1994 to manage CIDA budget cuts .
if she is planning to give her senior officials the tools they need to ensure accountability at CIDA , why did she refuse to establish this committee ?
hon. Diane Marleau ( Minister for International Cooperation and Minister responsible for Francophonie , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , since we brought in some very strict and very big cuts to CIDA we have done a lot of work to streamline the administration at CIDA .
the hon. member is asking us to put in another layer of bureaucracy .
somehow it does not seem to sit well with what they usually tell us .

exports OF DEFENCE GOODS
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs , or rather the Deputy Prime Minister .
since 1990 , it has been standard practice for a detailed report to be tabled before this House on exports of Canadian defence goods .
this year , the report has still not been tabled , more than six months after the usual date of publication .
while the government is boasting of being an agent of moderation and a great pacifier in the international community , what is it concealing from us by delaying the publication of this report ?
hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , this has to do with the tabling of a report .

Mrs. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is addressed to the Minister of Natural Resources .
Devco ' s chairman , Mr. Joe Shannon , pretends to be working hard to modernize Devco .
one of his projects has been to rip up the rail track used to haul coal away from the mines .
in the name of efficiency trucks are now used instead .
i am sure it is the desire to modernize that has led Mr. Shannon to pursue this project .
i am sure it has nothing to do with the fact that Mr. Shannon is the owner of one of the largest trucking companies on Cape Breton Island .
while the House has heard many stories about Liberal patronage , it is rare to find an example this blatant -
the Deputy Speaker :
order , please .
Mr. Gerry Byrne ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member has made a very specific allegation but in a very roundabout way .
the chairman and the entire board of directors of Devco are actively pursuing the revitalization of this crown corporation .
i am pleased with the work they are doing under difficult circumstances .
facing an international environment for these types of markets is a difficult process .
they are doing a very good job .
we support them fully and I encourage the hon. member to do the same instead of making silly accusations .
* * *
taxation
Mr. Gerry Ritz ( Battlefords - Lloydminster , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the finance minister is deaf to his colleague ' s admission the other day that the Liberals are " very familiar with the fact that our income taxes are very high '' .
will the government do the responsible thing and bring tax relief to millions of working Canadians who have been impoverished by bracket creep , or the one million small business owners whose small business deduction remains unchanged for 15 years ?
where is the tax relief for all Canadians from the government ' s insatiable tax appetite ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , perhaps the hon. member missed the announcement by my colleague , the Minister of Human Resources Development .
let me repeat it .
as a result of his announcement that the employment insurance premiums will drop from $ 2.90 to $ 2.70 , we have just provided Canadians with a tax cut of $ 1.4 billion .
the Deputy Speaker :
order .
that will bring to a close the question period for today .

class OF 1988
the Deputy Speaker :
while I am on my feet , I would like to remind members of a very important anniversary .
nine years ago today , the brilliant and very distinguished class of 1988 was elected for the first time to this House .
i want to congratulate all my colleagues on this very happy anniversary occasion .
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , on a point of order .
i was just wondering about your comment .
were you talking about the brilliant class of 1988 including the 211 Conservatives who were elected at that time ?
the Deputy Speaker :
i was talking about the brilliant members of the class of 1988 who are here in the House celebrating the anniversary .
i am sure the hon. member would not to confuse the issue .
the Deputy Speaker :
i have notice of a question of privilege .
* * *
privilege
Ms. Bev Desjarlais ( Churchill , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of privilege concerning a press release issued by the member for Dauphin - Swan River , dated November 19 , 1997 .
Beauchesne , citations 64 through 70 , make it clear that reflections on a member of Parliament that make it impossible for that member to fulfil their duties properly comprise a breach of privilege .
on November 18 , at the Standing Committee on Transportation I introduced an amendment that would ensure the employees of the Canadian ports that they would not be subjected to undue hardship as a result of changes to Bill C - 9 .
reform did not introduce an amendment that would protect these employees .
yet the member for Dauphin - Swan River did a press release which he inaccurately headlined " Liberals and NDP oppose protection for ports employees . "
such misrepresentations make it impossible for me to fulfil my duties as a member of Parliament .
the actions that I took at a committee of this House , actions which are a matter of record , are deliberately misrepresented to the public by a fellow member of that committee .
this is not a matter for debate or question of interpretation or of nuance .
it is a case where I am accused of not doing something that the records show I did .
i move that the -
the Deputy Speaker :
i have listened carefully to the hon. member ' s comments which strike me as being in the nature of a complaint .
i understand that sometimes in either debates in the House or press releases or in statements outside the House , members may say things about one another that are considered by the other to be inaccurate or a misrepresentation .
the normal method of dealing with such things is through either making a speech in the House , as the hon. member has done on this occasion , or by sending out another press release or whatever steps the member may think appropriate .
however , I do not believe this constitutes a question of privilege and I certainly do not believe that the statements made , however offensive the hon. member may have found them , are in any way impeding her ability to carry on her duties as a member of this place .
that is the test of a question of privilege .
i will consider the matter closed .

Mr. Speaker , how can we be asked to rise and stand for a man who represents justice in a country like China when he was the butcher of Tiananmen Square ?
how can we do that ?
the Deputy Speaker :
i think the hon. member has the right to remain at his seat , should he wish to do so .
it is entirely appropriate , when a foreign guest is here in our gallery , that the fact of his presence be recognized .
that is what the Chair did and I think that is entirely appropriate .

the Deputy Speaker :
i do not think this is a point of order .
hon. members are free to stand , or sit in their seats , as they wish .
there is no obligation on members to stand or do whatever .
i think the matter is closed .
the guest is here and I do not believe there is any point of order arising out of it .

divorce ACT
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank you for the opportunity to introduce this bill and thank my hon. colleague from Skeena for seconding it .
sadly , all too often marriages in Canada end in divorce .
unfortunately , children are frequently the casualty of these breaks - ups and they are further hurt when custody is awarded to only one parent .
this bill would provide for automatic joint custody unless there is proven neglect or abuse .
children need the love and support of both parents and our laws should reflect that .

Mr. Speaker , the fourth petition requests that Parliament amend the Criminal Code , the Bail Reform Act of 1972 and the Parole Act to reflect society ' s abhorrence of violence .
the petitioners ask that the sentencing of violent offenders adequately protect the victims of crime and society as a whole by removing the offender from society without early release .
they also request that agents of the crown be held accountable for their actions in allowing dangerous criminals to walk free and that the criminal justice system finally recognize the rights of victims over those of the criminal .

questions ON THE ORDER PAPER
Mr. Paul DeVillers ( Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , today we will answer Question No. 12 . . [ Text ]
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver ) :
with regard to phase 3 of the Pacific Rim national Park , which was to have been proclaimed a national park in or around 1975 , ( a ) what is the reason or reasons phase 3 has never been proclaimed a national park ; and ( b ) what is the target date now for proclaiming phase 3 of the national park a national park ?
hon. Andrew Mitchell ( Secretary of State ( Parks ) , Lib . ) : ( a ) The proposed Pacific Rim national park lies within areas currently subject to comprehensive land claim , or treaty settlement , negotiations .
where proposed national parks are affected by aboriginal claims , government policy precludes proclamation of these parks until the claims are settled .
pending settlement of these claims , however , such parks may be proclaimed as national park reserves .
this allows the proposed park area to be administered in the interim pursuant to the National Parks Act .
( b ) The treaty claims affecting Pacific Rim are currently in negotiation and have no specific timeframe for conclusion .
when settlements have been reached , the goverment will move expeditiously to proclaim all three components of the proposed Pacific Rim national park , not just phase 3 , as a national park .
Mr. Paul DeVillers :
Mr. Speaker , I move that the other questions stand .
the Deputy Speaker :
is that agreed ?
some hon. members :
agreed .

Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
earlier today I asked the Minister of Finance a question and he responded to that question , saying that I had misquoted the auditor general .
i would like to give the Minister of Finance an opportunity to clarify his position as quickly as possible -

is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
( motion agreed to )
the Deputy Speaker :
the House heard the proposal of the chief government whip .
when shall the bill be read the third time ?
by leave , now ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to have an opportunity to once again address the House on this important piece of legislation .
first , let me thank all the members of the House for their support of this bill on second reading , as well as their support today in expediting the processing of this important piece of legislation .
i would also be remiss if I did not take a moment to thank the members of the standing committee on heritage .
they have examined Bill C - 7 and gone through an examination clause by clause .
i wish to thank the members of the committee who have undertaken that and brought this bill back to the House .
i am thoroughly convinced and I know that members as they have examined this bill understand that it is a critical step , a very important step in protecting a very critical ecosystem that is in existence at the confluence of the Saguenay and St. Lawrence rivers .
as we have seen through the process both in the development of this piece of legislation in terms of the co - operation of the various partners , the various levels of government , today we are demonstrating with the passage of this bill a good level of co - operation between the federal and provincial governments where we see a bill where we have an important common objective of respecting and protecting an important ecosystem .
we see a good example of our ability to work together for the good of all Canadians .
however , it is also important to remember that the government cannot , in and of itself , take total credit for this .
all the various stakeholders and interests in that area have worked hard with government to structure this marine park in a way that works not only to protect the ecosystem in that area but works to enhance the communities there and the economy is there .
this is a good example of a grassroots , community based initiative and one that can and should be replicated as we move forward on other initiatives .
all Canadians can be proud as stewards of their marine environment .
this legislation will give us the opportunity , the tools and the structure we need in this particular area to make sure that the protection of the ecosystem takes place .
in this case particularly in terms of the beluga whale .
marine ecosystems are dynamic , three dimensional and ever changing and their stewardship requires the collective action and goodwill of all stakeholders .
as I mentioned earlier , we are seeing this with this legislation .
as members know , a big part of the mandate of Parks Canada is stewardship .
we are required , as an organization on behalf of all Canadians from coast to coast , to not only ensure that our special places , be they marine conservation areas , national parks or historic sites , are available for Canadians today but we have a very important responsibility to make sure that those special places remain unimpaired for the enjoyment and use of future generations .
we have that responsibility to our children and to our grandchildren , as we have the responsibility to take what was passed to us by the previous generation , our parents and grandparents , to ensure that their wise decisions in protecting national parks from the previous century as we have moved through the 20 th century , are continued and that we continue with that legacy and that stewardship .
the concept of marine conservation areas which is a relatively new one is going to be part of that process .
we are developing a system of marine conservation areas across Canada .
we have identified 29 specific ecosystems in all our oceans as well as in our Great Lakes and we are in the process , as we are with this piece of legislation , of protecting those areas .
i think it is important to note at this time that we are the first country in the world proceeding in this manner .
we are the first country that understands and recognizes in a tangible way our obligations to protect our marine ecosystems .
together we will all strive to ensure the sustainability of these critical marine ecosystems .
this legislation and the structure in the park that it is putting in place will provide many opportunities for local residents , community and business interests to derive economic benefits from the establishment of this marine conservation area .
just as we saw co - operation between the various levels of governments , the business community and the community at large to establish this park , so too will we see those types of partnerships come together to make sure that this park has both the protection of the ecosystem as well as the generation of new economic development primarily through tourism in this important area in the province of Quebec .
we welcome the opportunity , as a federal government , to work with those partners and to explore the opportunities as they come forward .
the unprecedented support for this bill in this House demonstrates clearly the common concern that we all share in the protection of our natural and cultural heritage .
i am pleased to see that type of support .
it represents clearly how deeply Canadians feel about our special places in this country and what type of responsibility and expectations they have towards us , as Parliamentarians , to ensure that we carry out that stewardship in an appropriate way .
we all feel our own places are special .
i urge my colleagues to continue to support this legislation and to provide support for this bill at third reading .
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) :
when the Reform Party critic from Kootenay - Columbia spoke on November 4 on this bill , he raised certain issues of concern .
i quote from the Reform member for Kootenay - Columbia :
the legislative process that we entered into in this House is very important .
all steps in the process are very important .
in this case the committee work will be a very valuable part of putting this important legislation in place .
it is important for people on both sides of this issue to have an opportunity to express themselves so that we as members have a clear understanding as to where their concerns are .
what we suggested is that the committee must take a look at the flexibility of the legislation and the impact on potential tenants .
the committee members unanimously defeated the call for witnesses .
the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage effectively gave it the old rubber stamp .
the committee did not do its job .
it did not do due diligence .
the rubber stamp was unanimous by all other parties .
as far as the member for Kootenay - Columbia stated on November 4 , 1997 , once again the Liberal government is using the House as a rubber stamp .
today we now have the committee acting like a rubber stamp .
some of the concerns raised by the Reform critic are , for example , the implication for commercial and sports fisheries on the St. Lawrence .
what are the implications for other users of the river ?
it is absolutely essential that the people who are using the area for its marine life be consulted .
what are the implications because of the overlay of the park regulations ?
if we consult generally speaking we can avoid any confrontations and avoid taking unnecessary steps .
most important is what precedent has this bill established for future parks .
parks cannot be established in isolation or in a vacuum .
consultation is required in order to ensure that they work well .
at second reading the member for Kootenay - Columbia said that it is imperative the committee ask all the questions and ensure those questions are debated at committee and answered before coming to a final conclusion .
this was not realized .
i reject the rubber stamp process and therefore have some concerns about the balance of this legislation .
it would appear that all the other parties at the committee are unwilling to do their jobs .
all the same , this would not stop Reform from voting in favour of the establishment of the park .
parks are an important issue to the Reform Party .
reluctantly and in spite of the flawed process I am recommending to my colleagues that we vote in favour of the park .
in conclusion , on a personal note as a Canadian I am proud to see that Canada will have the first marine national park in the world .
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to speak to Bill C - 7 at third reading .
first of all , I would like to thank my colleagues on the heritage committee for their quick and efficient consideration of this bill .
i would like to thank the Parks Canada and justice department officials who worked on the drafting and presentation of the bill .
members will recall that this bill implements an agreement signed in april 1990 by the Government of Quebec and the Government of Canada .
the marine park project was launched in 1985 , and on June 3 , 1988 , the governments of Canada and Quebec agreed to meet to discuss the establishment of a marine park in the Saguenay region and they finally agreed on the objectives in 1990 .
both governments conducted public consultations to set the park boundaries definitively .
an advisory committee was then set up , bringing together representatives from the following organizations : the affected RCMs , the scientific community , the Union qu 茅 b 茅 coise pour la conservation de la nature and the Coalition pour le parc marin du Saguenay - Saint - Laurent .
this committee was to advise planners about how the project was perceived in the region as well as about the contents of a park development proposal .
this committee and the officials representing the ministers concerned by the project were able to bring to light what was involved and the interest of the local people in creating a marine park .
in April 1993 , the governments announced what the boundaries of the marine park would be and , at the same time , launched the public consultation process on the development proposal .
the two governments have agreed to harmonize their involvement and that of their various departments and organizations .
they have agreed to share current and future infrastructures , installations and equipment for the marine park .
the two governments have established a harmonization committee made up of four members , that is two for each government .
the committee must harmonize Canada and Quebec ' s initiatives , primarily as regards the following : planning ; research ; management and programming of activities ; consultations with interested individuals and groups ; integration of planning and development efforts ; terms for the sharing of existing or future infrastructures , installations and equipment ; implementation schedule and exchange of personnel ; communications and the organization of seminars , symposiums and fairs ; protection of aquatic fauna and flora ; and , finally , public safety .
on June 5 , 1997 , Quebec ' s National Assembly passed Bill 86 .
however , since the park will be jointly managed by the federal and provincial governments , the Quebec legislation can only come into effect once the federal bill has been given royal assent .
this is why I ask hon. members to pass the bill at third reading today , so as to establish a marine park that will increase the level of protection afforded to ecosystems in part of the Saguenay fjord and in the northern estuary of the St. Lawrence River , for conservation purposes , while also promoting its use for educational , recreational and scientific purposes by current and future generations .
the bill will also help promote local tourism , attract infrastructure spending and result in the creation of permanent jobs in the park .
i am delighted to see that the process is about to be completed .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the hon. member for Burin - St.
George ' s would like to speak on the bill .
is there unanimous consent ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
Mr. Bill Matthews ( Burin - St.
Mr. Speaker , I thank members for their consent .
it must be Friday .
i would like to add my congratulations and gratitude to all those who have worked tirelessly to bring this project to fruition .
on behalf of my colleague from Chicoutimi , I would especially like to congratulate all the stakeholders in the vast region affected by the establishment of this marine park , including the municipalities that have promoted the idea of the marine park .
congratulations on making the park a success .
this process involved in the establishment of the Saguenay St. Lawrence Marine Park will be a model for the development of other marine conservation areas for years to come .
this marks the first time two governments acting within their respective jurisdictions jointly established a park .
it is probably the park that underwent the largest consultation process ever held in this country .
the process led to increasing the proposed boundaries of the park by approximately 40 % .
this consultative process also allowed the people who will be affected by the park to share their views , concerns and ideas .
throughout the debate we have heard about maintaining the ecological integrity of our ecosystems .
this party believes that the project goes a long in doing just that .
the Progressive Conservative Party has always played a leading role in the protection of our environment and the development of both terrestrial and marine parks .
i am happy to state that we will continue to do that .
this marine park is an excellent illustration of Canadians becoming stewards of their marine heritage and working together toward the common goal of maintaining the area ' s ecological integrity and ensuring its long term sustainability .
when we were in government , we recognized the importance of conserving our national marine areas .
many members will know that there are four natural regions for national marine conservation , the Arctic Ocean , the Pacific Ocean , the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes .
this is also the first marine conservation area on the east coast and I look forward to the development of the remaining nine marine parks in the Atlantic region .
too often people think that conservation means no development , or in the case of fisheries , no fishing .
conservation and development should not be seen as being working at cross purposes , but working together hand in hand .
national marine conservation areas are meant to , and I quote : " represent the diversity of our nation ' s marine ecosystems , facilitate and encourage marine research and ecological monitoring , protect depleted of endangered species and populations and preserve habitats considered critical to the survival of these species , protect and maintain areas critical to the life cycles of the economically important species and provide interpretation of marine areas for the purposes of conservation , education and tourism '' .
in closing , I once again want to thank members for their unanimous consent to allow me to speak and I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the efforts of our colleague from Chicoutimi who has worked tirelessly over the last 12 years to make this park a reality .
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui 猫 re , BQ ) :
this bill is of particular interest to me , because I come from the Saguenay and I grew up in this very special environment , which is the envy of many tourists who come to our beautiful area .
the establishment of this new park confirms the significance of this resort area , where people can admire one of the most magnificent features of Quebec ' s landscape , the Saguenay fjord , where a mighty river flows .
we have waited a long time for this bill .
the idea of a marine park was first introduced twelve years ago .
in 1988 , Canada and Quebec agreed to join forces to discuss the establishment of a marine park .
better late than ever , we could all say .
nevertheless , without all these overlapping areas of federal and provincial jurisdiction , Quebec , as a sovereign nation , would surely have launched this project in a more timely manner .
anyway , as good citizens , we must act within the rigid federal system and make the most of it .
therefore , I must recognize again , as I did in the speech I gave on this bill on November 4 , that under the agreement concerning the required legislative or regulatory measures to be passed , both levels of government , which signed the deal on April 6 , 1990 , agreed for once to act within their jurisdiction .
we all remember that this unique project came from the grassroots and finally made it to our legislative institutions .
local and regional communities that have actively cooperated in creating this marine park are being called upon to become closely involved in its management .
as members of the coordinating committee , representatives of local and regional communities will be able to closely follow the implementation of the master plan for the marine park .
i have already expressed this concern , and I call on each of these representatives to be very careful in ensuring that protection of marine resources will be in keeping with the spirit of Bill C - 7 that we will be adopting shortly .
in addition , as the member for that beautiful region , I am especially concerned about the employment situation .
i believe that job creation and environmental protection are not incompatible .
there has to be a balance .
in this respect , I would like to point out that the federal government has up to now concentrated all its investments in this area on the sites which it owns , namely wharfs and the shoreline .
i believe that as an extension of this legislation , the federal government should demonstrate its good faith and provide the necessary funds for the construction of the highway between Baie - Sainte - Catherine and Petit - Saguenay , a highway that the population has been demanding for 25 years .
today , a great number of tourists follow the river and take the ferry between Baie - Sainte - Catherine and Tadoussac without going inland along the Saguenay fjord .
i therefore call on the Liberal government to take immediate action to meet this important need for infrastructure so that the park can become an engine for the development of the tourism industry in our region .
i do not have to remind you of the record high unemployment rates in our area over the last several years .
this initiative is a way of returning to the region the taxes paid by the local people and of alleviating the cuts in employment insurance that have hurt so many of them .
i would like to add that the situation is the same in the case of the wharfs at Anse - Saint - Jean and Petit - Saguenay ; these belong to the federal government and are in urgent need of investments .
so the time has come for the government to invest in all this infrastructure in support of the goodwill expressed with the passing of Bill C - 7 .
the park is part of two major geological formations .
the Saguenay fjord and the north shore of the St. Lawrence belong to the old basement of the Canadian Shield made up of crystalline rocks from 600 million to 4 billion years old .
four billion years ; it gives one pause for reflection .
mankind is pretty insignificant , when all is said and done .
the Logan fault , which more or less follows the St. Lawrence valley , is a major nonconformity separating the rock formations of the Canadian Shield and the Appalachians .
the Saguenay fjord is a deep gash in the Canadian Shield , a series of fault lines in the earth ' s crust .
all these faults and breaks in the earth ' s crust led to the breakdown of part of the continental shelf .
a series of glaciations carved out the entire St. Lawrence River system as we now know it .
the Saguenay River has the peculiarity of being a freshwater river , fed by Lac Saint - Jean , and a saltwater river , fed by the tide waters of the St. Lawrence .
the uniqueness of this ecosystem has led to the presence , in the Saguenay River , of species of flora and fauna that may be found nowhere else .
so it is easy to understand why this region is of such interest to the scientific community .
in fact , the marine park is in an extremely diversified and rich environment .
the aquatic wildlife found in this park includes several species of plankton , some of which are plants while others are animals .
this underwater vegetation provide a habitat for many kinds of fish .
and to make things more interesting , we also find two species of aquatic mammals , the beluga and the common seal .
this explains why so many visitors are overhelmed by the exceptional beauty of the region and its many assets .
furthermore , I would be remiss if I did not point out that this is an extremely significant region in the history of North America , because it is here that Aboriginal and European civilizations converged .
for thousands of years , the confluence of the Saguenay and St. Lawrence rivers has been a centre of human activity seeking to benefit from this exceptional marine environment .
today , the mouth of the Saguenay is once again becoming a centre for encountering and discovering marine life .
like the explorers and hunters of past civilizations , present - day visitors can experience the great sensations that contact with marine mammals can provide .
in returning to its roots , our society is rediscovering its love of the sea and retracing its history .
to conclude , I wish to thank the numerous local organizations , local and regional communities , environmental groups and native peoples involved and the scientific community for supporting the establishment of this marine park .
i especially wish to thank G 茅 rard - Raymond Morin , the MNA for Dubuc , and his predecessor , Hubert Desbien , who have always promoted with courage and determination this huge tourist project , which will be a driving force for the economy of our region .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
i am proud to speak in support of this initiative and to recommend that the final report be accepted by the House .
all Canadians will benefit from the preservation of this unique marine ecosystem .
i wish to acknowledge the work undertaken by the House Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage to expedite the passage of Bill C - 7 .
the wisdom and guidance shown by the committee chair , my distinguished colleague from Lac St. Louis , deserves recognition from all members of the House .
i congratulate all committee members and associates for their invaluable insights , comments and level of co - operation .
aboriginal participation was ensured and input from all stakeholders was accepted .
the public participation process incorporated throughout the conception of Bill C - 7 and in the evolution to the final report before us today is a fine example of what can be accomplished when Canadians agree on a challenge and together strive toward a common purpose and achieve a just conclusion .
as I sated at second reading and shall mention again , the degree of intergovernmental co - operation serves as a hallmark which I hope can be applied to future endeavours between federal and provincial governments .
i would be remiss if I did not draw attention to several matters raised in a previous debate regarding Bill C - 7 , by participants during the years of marine park development , and through recent consultations and correspondence received by the New Democratic Party .
i acknowledge and accept , as mentioned earlier in my speech , the wisdom and guidance demonstrated by my distinguished colleague from Lac St. Louis .
his ability to expedite the progress of Bill C - 7 and to ensure implementation without further delay is a credit to the House and a fine reference to Parliament ' s ability to serve Canadians in a positive manner .
i call upon my colleagues , the hon. Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Secretary of State for Parks , to acknowledge and commit to the following requests submitted by concerned Canadians .
to have asked for further consultations , to have called for numerous amendments and to have requested various forms of additional review would have resulted in unnecessary and detrimental delays .
i call upon members of the House to acknowledge and include in the consideration of further marine park projects the following language in the preamble and purpose of future bills :
that the preamble shall include such language as to reflect a desire " to conserve and to maintain the integrity of the natural ecosystems within the park ' s boundaries '' .
i do not intend to portray Bill C - 7 as ignoring this principle .
nor do I call for an amendment .
i wish to convey to my colleagues an opportunity to strengthen the underlying purpose for establishing marine parks , which is to conserve and preserve our natural heritage for this and future generations .
the following addition to the purpose of future marine park bills will assist in a successful marine parks program and increase the level of protection of marine ecosystems for the benefit of present and future generations :
this will be done by preserving and maintaining the integrity of natural ecosystems within the park boundaries , and in particular by protecting and aiding the recovery of species and populations designated at risk .
i ask my colleagues to acknowledge these requests so that they may be included for consideration in future noble park efforts .
i thank the House for the opportunity to speak on these matters .
i will voice again the support of the New Democratic Party for the acceptance of the final report , Bill C - 7 .
on a personal note , I hope that the same co - operation exists when it comes time to debate park status for Lawler and McNabb Island in the beautiful harbour of Halifax , Nova Scotia .
Mr. Guy Saint - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to rise in the House of Commons in support of a bill to establish a new marine park in Quebec within the marine area conservation network .
on behalf of all Canadians , I would like to thank the members of the House of Commons who are present today as well as those who were here before for their co - operation which will result in passage of this major piece of legislation .
canada can be proud of its vast experience in the vital area of protection of its heritage resources .
the bill is aimed at improving , for conservation purposes and for the benefit of present and future generations , the level of protection given to the ecosystems found in the Saguenay River fjord and in the St. Lawrence estuary , while promoting their use for educational , recreational and scientific purposes .
this approach is in line with the government ' s position with regard to the protection of ecosystems and sustainable development .
as with the amendments to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act , this bill shows the government ' s willingness to work for the conservation of marine natural resources through the development of legislative and policy measures that respond to global environmental concerns .
this bill is also tangible proof of the government ' s commitment to sustainable development .
it is a positive contribution to the efforts made to protect Canada ' s biodiversity and to preserve the quality of our natural environment for the benefit of present and future generations .
this bill provides for a complete legislative framework for the management of the federal government ' s responsibilities .
its purpose is to complete but not overlap the current federal legislation , including the Fisheries Act , the Canadian Environmental Protection Act , the Migratory Birds Convention Act , 1994 , the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act , the Navigable Waters Protection Act and the Canada Shipping Act .
on December 12 , 1996 , both governments tabled their respective bills .
the federal bill died on the Order Paper when the last federal election was called .
however , the Quebec National Assembly adopted Bill 86 on June 5 , 1997 .
the provincial legislation will come into force when the federal legislation is promulgated .
now , it is incumbent upon us to honour our commitments and to create a great marine park in Quebec .
i wish to thank all members of the House , whether they belong to the Bloc Quebecois , the Liberal Party of Canada or the Conservative Party .
i urge every member of the House to join me in supporting this bill .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
questions and comments .

private MEMBERS ' BUSINESS
DONKIN MINE
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or , NDP ) moved :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to thank you , the members of this House , for engaging in debate on my Motion No. 136 , requesting that the Government of Canada take action to see the Donkin Mine in Cape Breton be developed under crown control , specifically , that Donkin be opened under the control of Devco , the Cape Breton Development Corporation .
i ask this House to allow me to briefly give a bit of background regarding the history of coal mining in Canada .
many members know that our country ' s thriving coal industry is a source of significant benefit to the national economy .
many industries are involved in the transport and use of coal and all those which supply services , labour and equipment to mining operations rely directly on the coal fields for a large part of their income .
all of these industries and the individuals who work for them contribute to Canada ' s tax base .
their wages come from coal and their wages fuel the economy .
over 73,000 men and women are employed in the coal industry in Canada today .
for example , coal is the single largest commodity transported on Canada ' s railways and loaded at our ports .
the Coal Association of Canada estimates that ever dollar spent in coal production generates $ 2.36 in related industry and from income respending .
every direct job created in coal production supports an additional 3.7 jobs in the rest of the economy .
the National Energy Board of Canada predicts that Canada will generate 46 % more electricity in the year 2005 than in 1998 to meet the demand caused by an expanding population and an expanding economy .
furthermore , the forecast says that the amount of electricity generated from the coal will rise by 70 % over current levels .
it is true that Canada has a number of options to meet its power needs in the next century .
there is the potential for hydro development in Newfoundland , Quebec , British Columbia , Manitoba and Alberta , but the sites are in remote and environmentally sensitive locations , making them costly to develop and placing them in conflict with aboriginal communities which have claims to the land .
plants that harness ocean tides such as the one opened on the Annapolis River in Nova Scotia in 1984 , one of the first of its kind in North America , can also be looked to for inspiration when we consider how our country can meet its changing and expanding energy needs .
but the fact remains that one of Canada ' s most abundant economic resources available for the production of electricity is coal .
coal mining today is not the industry it used to be .
gone are the solitary miners working the coal face with pick and shovel .
gone are miners lamps from paraffin soaked rags ready to spark off explosions of the firedamp gas leaching from the stone walls around them .
today , mining is highly mechanized and heavily regulated .
canada can be proud of an industry with some of the world ' s safest mining conditions and progressive environmental management .
the picks and shovels have been replaced by automated systems that have dramatically improved the efficiency of mining .
one machine now does what many men used to .
few people make these connections between the light switch in their bedroom , the electricity for their TV and the coal mines deep beneath the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean .
if and when people think of coal they think of soot , of miners with blackened faces , of harmful emissions that would damage our already fragile environment .
let us face it , there is a serious question about the pollutants that are produced from burning coal .
but just as today ' s miners work in conditions that would have amazed the men who worked underground in the last 200 years , so too has the way in which coal was burned being changed and improved .
clean coal technologies can reduce emissions that would hurt the environment , especially the gases that dump acids into the ecosphere , sulphur and nitrogen oxides and carbon residues that have been linked to global warming .
technology cannot solve all of our problems , but it can certainly help .
let us not forget that we are building on a natural resource , naturally occurring coal , so that there is none of the environmental damage caused by processing or refining the product before it can be used .
another sea change in the industry has been the huge reduction in the number of coal mines across Canada .
in the 1930 s there were 400 small coal mines .
today there are only eight companies operating a total of 29 mines .
one of those eight producers is the crown corporation called Devco , the Cape Breton Development Corporation .
i can say with pride that Devco employs the best miners in the world .
they are men who have mining in their blood who belong to families that have seen grandfathers and fathers and sons go underground just as my father and grandfather did .
they are men who fought the vicious excesses of the private coal companies and who were trampled by the horses of the police and the army who acted as the private security guards for the coal company .
not many people outside Cape Breton know that we have a unique holiday .
on June 10 every year we remember Davis Day , the day when a miner was shot by company police after a peaceful demonstration .
we have a long history of struggle , of fighting for fair wages and safe working conditions , and we will keep on fighting .
my preamble stresses the important role these men have played in Canada ' s history and the important role I hope they will continue to play in the future .
those Cape Breton miners are today looking to their crown corporation .
they want to continue to do what Cape Bretoners do best , work hard and work honestly in the craft that has defined the economy of my island for centuries .
they want to provide the power to run the computers , fax machines and office buildings that keep the new economy moving forward .
they want to do their fair share .
Devco was founded in 1967 by an act of Parliament and is wholly owned by the government .
all of its $ 325 million in assets are located on Cape Breton Island and Devco remains the largest producer of coal in eastern Canada .
with over 1,300 employees it is also one of the largest industrial employers in the region .
at present , Devco operates two collieries , Phalen Mine and Prince Mine and all of the supporting infrastucture that enables Devco to take Cape Breton coal and sell it around the world .
in 1996 - 97 Devco sold 2.4 million tonnes of coal which yielded revenues of $ 167 million .
it is apparent that Devco ' s contribution to the national coal industry is significant .
its contribution to the Cape Breton economy , which sees an extra $ 200 million a year thanks to Devco , is huge .
Devco is one of the few large employers in industrial Cape Breton and jobs supported indirectly by the corporation ' s activities employ thousands more .
when we look at the economic climate on my island it becomes pretty clear pretty quick that Devco ' s success and Cape Breton ' s success are one and the same .
four hundred and fifty people work at the Prince Colliery , eight hundred at Phalen .
imagine the impact on industrial Cape Breton ' s already skyrocketing unemployment rate , a rate that is currently in the range of 35 % to 40 % , if Devco ceased to exist .
it would take thousands and thousands of jobs with it .
even with the mines operating there is an expectation that 300 men will retire from Devco over the next three years , not to be replaced .
meanwhile all of our young people are leaving , there are no jobs and even their parents are joining the unemployment line .
it takes time and money to train miners and the will to renew and rejuvenate the workforce simply is not there .
i will provide the House with a background of Devco ' s history .
the Cape Breton coal fields were taken under crown control in 1968 when the Dominion Steel and Coal Company , better known as DOSCO , decided to conclude its decade - long attack upon the people of Cape Breton by abandoning the island altogether .
realizing the chaos this would cause , the government stepped in .
initially Devco was supposed to supervise the slow shutdown of the coal industry over a 15 - year period while it would help the workforce find new jobs in new fields .
then the oil crisis loomed and suddenly Canada needed the Cape Breton coal miners again just as it needed them during the first and second world wars .
now , instead of phasing out coal production , Devco was put in charge of drawing up a 20 to 25 year plan that would promote a stable industry which would benefit both Cape Breton and the rest of Canada .
now 25 years later there are just two mines operating in Cape Breton and the same Liberals who promised a stable industry when in government and in opposition are now back making plans on how they can shut down the coal fields .
despite this , Devco has become more efficient and more effective .
management and labour have worked together to make Devco deliver the goods for as little money as possible .
both the United Mine Workers of America and Devco ' s management deserve credit for this .
for example , in Prince mine , the deeps - the main shaft leading from the surface down to the coal face - have been realigned to make better use of the coal deposits .
meanwhile , Phalen mine has been plagued with problems caused by rock and gas outbursts , heavy roof conditions and flooding .
these problems have all increased the cost of Devco coal , despite the hard work of the employees who worked overtime to get the mine back into production .
in many ways we are back to where we started in 1968 , but the reasons Devco should exist are even more valid now than they were then .
there is hope .
there is a contingency plan in case the problems with the Phalen mine become so severe that it has to be closed early .
the contingency is the Donkin mine .
Donkin is the future of Devco and Devco remains the future of Cape Breton .
it is not often that I agree with the Liberal government , but today I am happy to stand and endorse the then minister ' s statement .
Donkin is a huge coal reserve beneath the Atlantic .
in 1981 Kilborn Engineering estimated that there were 1.4 billion tonnes of mineable coal off Cape Perce .
the mine itself has already been built , at taxpayer expense .
two gun barrel smooth tunnels and engineering studies have been completed by the Government of Canada .
the geology looks good and the quality looks even better .
an annual production of 3.8 million tonnes is feasible once Donkin goes into production .
selective mining could be undertaken during a trial period with , say , 500,000 tonnes mined annually .
that could be expanded once it is clear that a profit can be made .
Donkin is the gold mine of coal mines .
it should be opened by the same people who built it , the Cape Breton Development Corporation , acting in the interests of the people of Canada .
our government has made substantial investments into the coal industry and today , by committing to opening Donkin as part of Devco , we can start the process that will see Canadians getting a return on their investment .
not only have the taxpayers already paid to build Donkin , Devco also has most of the assets it would need to open the mine sitting idly at its abandoned site at Lingan .
there is $ 8 million worth of equipment , ready to be used , sitting and rusting .
Canadian taxpayers have already spent $ 88 million on Donkin .
mining experts from the union today are saying that current conditions could mean reduced capital requirements , which in turn would mean increased profits .
here is a quote from the report " The Donkin - Morien Mine :
building the Mine of the Future '' : " Production of 4.507 million tonnes per year is considered possible and economically feasible '' .
i repeat that it is the gold mine of coal mines .
Devco was right when it said in 1992 that Donkin mine is a valuable asset for the long term .
the Donkin tunnels give us access to the great riches of the Sydney coal field , a great Canadian asset as important as the Alberta tarsands or Newfoundland ' s Hibernia .
as we once again begin to talk of the new energy sources , be they the planned Sable pipeline or the nuclear reactors this government is keen to give China , it is critical that we do not forget the resources that have always been the backbone of our energy grid .
in time of war and crisis -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
with regret , I must inform the hon. member that her time has expired .
Mr. Gerry Byrne ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a great privilege to rise in the House and join my colleague from across the way .
i rise to address the House on Motion No. 136 which calls on certain limitations to be put on the development of Donkin mine in Cape Breton as a crown corporation .
i would like to begin by thanking the hon. member for Bras D ' or for her interest in the issue and the future of the Cape Breton Development Corporation , also known as Devco .
as a member from Atlantic Canada , I welcome the opportunity to debate this motion .
we are concerned about the long term economic health of Cape Breton and about the future of its young people .
i would also suggest the hon. member and this government share a common will for Cape Breton , to achieve long term economic success and social progress across the Island .
that is why our government continues to support the work of the Cape Breton Development Corporation which the hon. member knows is a federal crown corporation .
the Government of Canada has set a clear and reasonable goal for Devco .
as a coal mining company that is in the business of providing jobs and other economic benefits to Cape Breton , we expect Devco to become commercially viable on its own right .
we believe that commercial viability is the best way to ensure the tradition of coal mining continues in Cape Breton and that Devco maintains its position as a major employer within the region .
the need for Devco to succeed cannot be overemphasized .
the corporation continues to contribute more than $ 150 million to the Cape Breton economy through wages , pensions and the purchase of goods and services .
it is the largest coal producer and one of the largest industrial interest in eastern Canada , employing approximately 1,700 people .
the economic spinoffs from Devco ' s activities are felt in virtually every community of Cape Breton .
i am pleased to inform the House that Devco has embraced the government ' s challenge to become commercially viable .
it has taken steps to overhaul its operations , to introduce new technologies , to improve productivity and the labour relations found there and to better manage its business .
the corporation ' s five year business plan approved by the government in May of 1996 clearly stated Devco ' s mission which is to become a profitable coal mining company .
to aid the corporation achieving its goal of profitability and competitiveness with other energy sources , the government has provided Devco with a repayable loan of up to $ 69 million over three years .
i might add this is in addition to other federal funding that has been provided to the corporation since it was created in 1967 .
i am also pleased to report that Devco made a number of positive achievements in the one year of its operating business plan .
although it faced a number of ongoing challenges , particularly at its Phalen mine , the corporation operated within the $ 43.5 million funding level approved by the Government of Canada .
Devco ' s annual report for the period ending March 31 , 1997 shows a positive development on a number of fronts .
i would like to briefly outline some of the progress that has indeed been made .
for the first time in the history of the corporation , new contracts were negotiated with bargaining units without the use of an outside conciliator .
this is solid evidence of improved labour relations and the commitment of its employees , unions and management to work together .
the corporation ' s emphasis on safety is good for workers and it is good for Devco .
Devco has also taken further steps to involve its workers in the decision making process .
a quality management program known as beyond 200 was developed last year to promote continuous improvement and a commitment to quality across the corporation .
in terms of sales , in 1996 the corporation sold a record 2.8 million tonnes of coal to its primary customer , Nova Scotia Power Incorporated .
coal sales for the first six months of the current fiscal year yielded revenues of $ 86 million .
Devco ' s coal marketing strategy will continue to focus on meeting the needs of Nova Scotia power , which is far and away the corporation ' s most important customer .
i know hon. members will want to join me in congratulating Devco ' s management and workers on their efforts over the past year and a half .
their achievements to date have been meaningful and important .
for me personally I would like to congratulate Devco workers who have gone above and beyond the call of duty and showed the expert miners they truly are .
at the same time , it is important to acknowledge that more needs to be done .
the corporation is projecting a funding requirement of $ 25.5 million over the next two years which is within the limit approved by the government .
Devco is forecasting that it will achieve positive cash flows in the year 1999 - 2000 .
to achieve this latter goal , the corporation will have to continue to improve productivity at its existing facilities .
Devco ' s short term planning framework which as I noted earlier has been fully endorsed by this government calls for the corporation to focus its efforts on addressing the challenges it faces at its existing mines .
this is not an easy task .
over the next few months the corporation will explore ways to get around serious geological problems recently encountered at its Phalen mine .
Devco will be considering all options for the Phalen mine and for its other coal resources including Donkin coal .
this does not mean the Donkin mine will or will not be developed .
far from it .
in fact , as the hon. member for Bras D ' Or is aware , a private company is in the process of undertaking a feasibility study to determine whether the mine can be developed on a commercial basis by a private sector entity .
this analysis , combined with Devco ' s own studies over the past few months , will form the basis of its next annual corporate plan update .
this update will be submitted to government in early 1998 .
the government has complete confidence in the management of the Cape Breton Development Corporation and in its workers .
we agree that with the decisions that have to be made we firmly believe in management and workers ability to make appropriate recommendations to government for the future of the corporation .
in closing , I want to once again thank the hon. member for Bras D ' Or for bringing this matter before the House .
i believe that the underlying objective of this motion is to ensure employment and economic security in Cape Breton .
i can assure the hon. member that we will keep the House informed of any developments relating to Devco that contribute to this important goal .
if I may say , we are very open to assisting in the process of Cape Breton development and Atlantic Canadian development .
this government is committed to keeping an open channel to any and all new options .
Mr. Ghislain Fournier ( Manicouagan , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my speech today is in response to the motion moved on September 24 by the hon. member for Bras d ' Or , requesting that a crown corporation be established to develop the Donkin mine in the Cape Breton region of Nova Scotia .
i want to express my strongest opposition to this request , which , in my opinion , is totally groundless , especially for all Quebeckers , who are not concerned in any way by this so - called mine .
in fact , with all due respect to some hon. members , I would like to make an important correction .
Donkin is not a mine per se , but rather vein , or lead , indicating development could take place on that site during some time .
establishing a crown corporation is unacceptable mainly because mines are a provincial jurisdiction and the federal government has no jurisdiction whatsoever in the matter .
natural resources , including mines , forests and energy , belong to the provinces .
i think it shows a lack of respect for the taxpayers to mix the internal affairs of a province with the public funds of another province .
if that is what the renewal of the federation or the constitution is all about , this is not very convincing to me .
and if the federal government brings up Quebec ' s special status one more time , I will have to wonder what its word is worth .
one cannot talk about respect for Quebec the same way as for any other province , mixing all the provincial cards together .
it should be up to a province ' s government to manage regional matters like mines .
let us now look at the particular issue of Donkin .
to this day , absolutely no one has been able to prove that this coal mining project could be a profitable venture .
only one private firm seems to be interested in finding out what the situation is and in conducting a study at a cost of $ 400,000 , 75 % of which would be paid by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency .
however , the study would only determine the reserve ' s potential and would not clearly establish whether it is possible to develop the Donkin coal mine without sinking more public funds into it .
in its 1996 - 97 estimates , the Cape Breton Development Corporation , which is accountable to the federal government and which is currently developing the Phalen and Prince mines in Nova Scotia , anticipated losses of $ 35 million .
the development of a coal mine in Donkin could cost at least $ 100 million to $ 125 million .
the federal government has already invested $ 80 million , and it also holds the lease for that reserve .
as for the Nova Scotia government , it owns the resource and would therefore collect royalties should the mine be exploited .
how could a government justify spending between $ 100 million and $ 125 million on a project that offers absolutely no guarantee of success ?
in my riding of Manicouagan , as in several other regions , there are major potential mining opportunities .
since last year , when a geologist from the Quebec government discovered the Lac Vollant indicator , close to Sept - 脦 les , there has truly been a " Lac Vollant rush '' .
some people are going so far as to say that it could be the richest deposit every discovered .
never has the federal government gotten involved in or contributed to the exploration and long term development of such a large and promising deposit .
and yet , ask the hundreds of prospectors who rushed right out and staked their claims and they will tell you that they think this is an exceptional opportunity to discover minerals and then sell them to promoters who want to mine them .
the federal government never took any action .
a mining opportunity the federal government should have gotten involved in was the Natashquan mineralized sands .
Tiomin Ressource , the company that wants to mine these sands , suspended operations because of a breakdown in communications with the native community .
the company arrived at the site a year ago , but has not yet reached agreement with the native community .
what the federal government should have done , through the Department of Indian Affairs , was to appoint a conciliator at the very least .
if this had not resolved the problem , mediation would have had to be the next resort .
why did the federal government do nothing to help work out an agreement in Natashquan , and thus prevent the loss of several millions of dollars and hundreds of jobs ?
we are not asking for a crown corporation , just for the federal government to assume its responsibilities .
we cannot afford to lose investments like these in the tens of millions of dollars .
no riding can afford to lose millions of dollars in economic spinoffs from the private sector .
it is time for the federal government to get to work and resolve the disputes that are hindering development of our regions , rather than devote its energy to creating government organizations with no real and attainable financial objectives .
i have been speaking of my riding for the past few minutes , but I am sure that a number of my colleagues here recognize the same realities in their regions .
that is what happens when an overly centralized government is at the helm and the regions do not get their fair share .
as we are already aware , like a number of other fields of activity , mining must come under provincial jurisdiction .
take the example of the Soci 茅 t 茅 qu 茅 becoise d ' exploration mini 猫 re .
as you now , this is a government corporation which administers mining titles , such as the famous 800 square kilometres staked out by a Quebec government geologist last year near Lac Vollant .
in such a context , the Government of Quebec administers titles within its territory , using the funds of its own taxpayers if required .
however in the case of the Donkin mine , I am wondering how our friends in the other provinces will react when they learn that the federal government has invested between $ 100 and $ 125 million to develop a Nova Scotia mine with an uncertain future , not to mention the cost of setting up a fat Crown corporation .
it does not make any sense whatsoever to create a crown corporation to develop a mine such as the Donkin mine .
in politics , you cannot afford to take a gamble when $ 100 to $ 125 million are at stake .
this is inadmissible .
if developing this so - called mine was a sure bet , many private corporations would already have approached the Cape Breton Development Corporation .
but it is not the case .
the government does not have the right to invest public funds in a more than hazardous venture which comes under provincial jurisdiction anyway .
this is the reason why the federal government should not set up a crown corporation to do exploration or to develop the Donkin " gold mine '' .
for these obvious reasons , I urge the Liberal government not to create a corporation to develop mines .
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise in support of the motion put forward by my colleague from Bras D ' Or .
a fellow bluenoser , I might add , she certainly brings a unique and special perspective to the House .
she faces many challenges from the many communities which comprise her new federal riding of Bras D ' Or .
the motion speaks to the economic future of many of these same communities .
the timing of the debate on the motion is quite appropriate in light of the recent troubles in the Phalen colliery .
i would also like to speak to the overall question of the future of the Cape Breton Development Corporation better known as Devco .
while not a Cape Bretoner , my home in Pictou county shares the industrial Cape Breton tradition of coal mining .
for many years coal was a staple in the local economy in my constituency .
our most recent venture into the Westray mine , which ended in disaster , is certainly a sad reminder of the dangers associated with this industry in Nova Scotia in particular .
coal mining is a tradition that must adjust to the realities of the 21 st century .
in my view the development of the Donkin mine under the auspices of Devco is the best way to ensure successful adjustment that has long term benefits for Devco , employees , taxpayers and those who supported Devco operations throughout the years .
Devco management announced that the corporation ' s five year plan last year completely ruled out the development of Donkin , emphasizing instead the Phalen colliery .
Phalen has a history of instability and yet Devco management in its wisdom placed all of its mining eggs in one basket .
the Devco corporate plan also ruled out the identification of export markets despite significant evidence of the economic prospects of the exports of coal .
as my colleague quite eloquently stated , it is apparent that coal still has a place in the industrial world .
tying the coal from Donkin to the coal markets locally in Nova Scotia is a huge mistake in my honest opinion .
like all natural resources we have to try to capitalize on the ever increasing access to world markets that exist .
we should keep in mind that the development of Sable gas in Nova Scotia could certainly have a significant impact on the local markets as it pertains to coal .
last year during the hearings of the Senate committee on the future of Devco , Devco officials were warned frequently and consistently about the dangers of focusing solely on the Phalen mine to the exclusion of Donkin .
many industry analysts urged Devco to target foreign markets which would in fact require coal from the Donkin mine .
Devco management , again in its wisdom , refused to do so opting to sell the Phalen coal to a strictly domestic market .
Devco management then turned around and announced plans to sell the Donkin mine to a private operator by the name of Donkin Resources Limited , DRL , for a single dollar .
one dollar would be paid for this mine against a backdrop of millions of dollars that were put into the development of this site .
it is shocking to think that this could happen .
the expense to taxpayers is something that should certainly make us all sit up and take notice .
it brings to mind the situation that is happening presently in Hibernia where there have been rumblings that the federal government may contemplate selling this resource .
it is an industry with perhaps huge potential that might allow the Atlantic provinces , Newfoundland or Nova Scotia in particular , in some way , shape or form , to make giant steps forward toward becoming have provinces .
the government is being very short - sighted if it is contemplating such a move .
the situation appears to be moving rather rapidly .
the same Devco officials reported that the latest series of rock blasts at the Phalen mine could limit the potential of the mine for future ventures .
without the future of Phalen and with the apparent position taken on the Donkin mine , what does Devco have left ?
what remains for Devco ?
if both of these mines will not be operating Devco is a dead duck .
the answer is nothing .
the impact of the loss of 700 jobs in an area like Cape Breton is difficult to imagine for anybody who does not come from the maritimes .
the economic impact of that has expanded perhaps tenfold in comparison to the province of Ontario .
in an ideal world private industry would be able to assume responsibility and risk for developing Donkin , but in the real world and in private industry we know that private industry is often very reluctant and unwilling to make commitments to the future of the workers who would be negatively affected by the closure of Donkin .
this is economic business reality but the government has a responsibility .
the government must see that the Donkin situation is handled with great care .
Devco management clearly made a mistake in 1996 when it adopted this corporate plan .
not one of the three official parties in the House raised an objection at that time ; not the Liberals , not the Reform and not the Bloc .
they all gave Devco a free ride and made short - sighted decisions that were having a drastic effect on Atlantic Canada , particularly in Cape Breton .
is it any wonder the Liberals were then wiped off the electoral map in Nova Scotia on June 2 , 1997 ?
is it any wonder the Reform Party could not even find candidates to run in Cape Breton ?
it was left to the Senate to raise objections , the Senate that is often so much under attack .
it was the Senate that then brought the matter forward to deal with the issue of Devco ' s limited corporate plan .
thankfully the last election restored some balance to parliament and Canadians now have voices from all regions , not just from the west and Quebec .
in conclusion I condone the member for bringing this matter forward in such a timely manner .
the historic significance of coal mining not only in Cape Breton but throughout the maritimes is such that we must ensure that we will look at the long term viability of this industry and that we proceed with caution .
that responsibility must be assumed by the Government of Canada .
Mr. Darrel Stinson ( Okanagan - Shuswap , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the motion before us today reads :
that , in the opinion of this House , the government should take action to develop the Donkin mine as a crown corporation .
i have said before , and I will say it again , that I believe mining falls under provincial jurisdiction and not under federal jurisdiction .
government intrudes far too often in provincial areas and it keeps on doing it .
let us take a look at what is happening with regard to Devco .
one problem that Devco had was that it was saddled with the unfunded liabilities of its predecessor , Dominion Coal , including some $ 77.5 million for pensions , $ 117 million to clean up acid water drainage , reclaim tailings , and workmen compensation claims .
it went along not too badly , as was mentioned by the member from the Conservative Party , with regard to the shipment of coal overseas .
this worked out all right until the government representative for Devco decided to torpedo any exports of coal .
one main reason they had was Phalen was to come on board and supply coal to Nova Scotia power .
at that time I questioned the feasibility of cancelling any overseas contracts we had with regard to coal .
once an overseas contract is cancelled , it is very difficult to get that share of the marketplace back .
we know that there is a private group which has put forward an offer for the Donkin mines .
it is currently being reviewed by the Senate .
there was some $ 400,000 spent on a feasibility study done by John T . Boyd Co. from the United States .
will the taxpayers be left totally holding the bag for the demise of Devco with no other resources and all the liabilities for the environmental clean - up and the unfunded pension liabilities of past employees ?
these are questions that have to be asked .
we know that the Senate in its hearings is going through the offer and the feasibility study .
we also know at this time that there is nothing going on at Donkin .
this is a serious question .
the taxpayers of this country have put hundreds of millions of dollars into these projects .
time after time we have seen the mismanagement of public funds by government . We have to wonder how long we can keep on funding corporations such as this to make decisions like this .
let us look at this reasonably .
does anyone think a private company would shut down its export markets ?
not a hope .
but what does the government body do ?
it shuts down the export market and creates a problem .
that alone should tell us that the government has no business there .
an hon. member :
it has no business sense .
Mr. Darrel Stinson :
it has no business sense and it never has had any .
i find that rather amusing coming from the Conservatives .
it seems that a lot of these problems started when the Conservatives were in power .
we come back to the same thing .
we know that mining is extremely important to Canada .
it employs a large number of people , not only in the maritimes but right across Canada .
we know that coal will be under scrutiny here in this Kyoto agreement this government has decided to go into .
so we have many problems in the coal industry right now due to government intrusion .
we have to realize that in many instances the private sector is better at looking after the needs of the people in the communities .
all businesses have to make a profit in order to survive .
it is that simple .
when we have to compete in the world marketplace we have to understand that .
we are competing in a world market , not just among ourselves .
therefore when I see mismanagement of Canadian taxpayer dollars to the sums I see in here under Devco I have to seriously question the sanity of the governments involved .
i do not think I am the only one to question the sanity .
i think the taxpayers question it .
Mr. Peter Stoffer ( Sackville - Eastern Shore , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I sure hope Hansard got every single word of the recent comments of my colleague from the Reform Party .
it is amazing that during question period a very passionate plea came from a Reform member from northern B.C. I lived for nine years in Watson Lake , Yukon , a town very close to Fort Nelson which he had mentioned in his question .
he made a very passionate plea " for the federal government not to divest itself of the Fort Nelson airport .
we need the federal government to keep its hands on Fort Nelson airport '' .
not more than two hours later they turn around and say that the government has to get out of coal mining .
i would really like to know what side of its mouth the Reform Party is going to talk from today .
one minute the government is no good and the next minute we need the government .
please , for the sake of all Canadians and for their constituents , the Reform Party should make up its mind .
it is unbelievable .
i find it amazing that no matter what the subject members on the Reform benches think the solution is always fire public servants , sell off public assets and return to some ideal state of nature that sounds like a cross between Sunday school and the wild west .
i know the hon. member will find this hard to believe but most people in Canada do not want an American style government which does nothing for working people but lectures them on morality .
most Canadians want a government that will stand up for people and make job creation its number one priority .
that is why I am here , to push this government to help create jobs on Cape Breton Island .
yes , crown corporations like Devco have been inefficient .
it is not because of the workers .
it is because of a handful of powerful men who have made themselves rich at taxpayer expense .
the problem is not the crown corporations .
the problem is the people who ride the gravy train .
i have lived in Nova Scotia for nine years and it is a great honour for me to look in the cameras and face all of Canada and wholeheartedly support my hon. colleagues from Cape Breton .
i thank them for their wonderful efforts in trying to get this motion through the House .
i also wish to thank the hon. House leader of the Conservative Party for his gracious remarks with regard to this motion .
after what the hon. member has had to go through for the last few years with Westray , and I know I do not need to go into what has happened with Westray , it is a very emotional time for him to stand in this House and mention coal mining in his area let alone Cape Breton .
he deserves the kudos from the New Democratic Party and all Canadians .
the other day I was in Cape Breton and I met three absolutely wonderful people .
they are trying to get us to move this government in the direction of making Donkin part of the Devco corporation plan .
it is imperative for this to happen .
i encourage all members of this House and all Canadians to head up to Cape Breton and take North America ' s most beautiful scenic route , the Cabot Trail .
those who choose to do that can stop at wonderful areas like Ch 茅 ticamp , Louisburg and Sydney .
they will understand the feeling and the love Cape Bretoners have for the rest of Canada and they will be able to return that love .
a young woman stood up at a conference the other day and said " ladies and gentlemen , I am 18 , I am a female and I am a Cape Bretoner '' .
according to the Reformers that is three strikes against her , get out of there .
that is a scandalous shame .
i find that hard to believe .
i would have loved it if the Reformers could have been at that conference in Centennial hall to tell her " there is no future for you here , out you go .
government is no good , we can ' t help you .
let the dogs eat you '' .
i get really mad when I get on this subject .
the hon. Liberal member from Newfoundland did not give us an answer on whether he supports this motion or not .
i would really like an answer before we recess today .
is the Liberal Party in favour of this motion or not ?
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
before we resume debate , we will ask members to please keep their interventions short and then we will get at it .
Mr. Hec Clouthier ( Renfrew - Nipissing - Pembroke , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise to address the House on Motion No. 136 which calls on the government to develop the Donkin mine in Cape Breton as a crown corporation .
i join the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources in thanking the hon. member for Bras d ' Or for bringing this matter before the House .
there has been a great deal of debate in Cape Breton about the future of the Donkin mine .
the government appreciates the opportunity to address this issue and to advise the hon. member and all Canadians of its position on this matter .
as the parliamentary secretary has noted , the Cape Breton Development Corporation , better known as Devco , is a coal mining company that currently operates not one but two coal mines as well as support facilities that include a railway , a port facility and a coal washing plant .
it holds all the coal leases for Cape Breton , including the Donkin mine on the island ' s east side .
the corporation is a major employer in Cape Breton and must continue to play a vital role in the long term viability of Nova Scotia ' s great coal mining industry .
in order to do this Devco must become commercially viable .
as hon. members have been informed , the corporation is continuing to lose money .
by the way , that is exactly what my horses did when I raced them at Sydney , lost money .
progress is being made but Devco still has a long way to go before it can meet the government ' s objective of being a commercially viable crown corporation .
hon. members know Devco believes the key to economic profitability in the short term is not to play bingo at Stornoway but to get its current business right , to reverse the trend of annual losses by the fiscal year 1999 - 2000 .
with that in mind , this wonderful corporation has focused on achieving productivity improvements and introducing new technologies and promoting increased co - operation between management and labour and I hope between all members in this esteemed House of Commons .
as the parliamentary secretary has very clearly and unequivocally indicated , Devco will be looking at all options to get around the existing geological problem at its Phalen mine .
an hon. member :
it is pronounced Phalen .
Mr. Hec Clouthier :
there is a difference of opinion on the pronunciation of Phalen .
i am from the upper Ottawa valley and I believe it is pronounced Phalen .
notwithstanding that the corporation will also look at the potential contribution of its full resources including Donkin coal prior to submitting its annual corporate plan update earlier next year .
an hon. member :
you are digging yourself in pretty deep .
Mr. Hec Clouthier :
if I were on the other side I would really be in deep or out of it .
we are on the government side , are we not ?
an hon. member :
yes , we are on the leadership side .
Mr. Hec Clouthier :
the leadership side , the side that ultimately makes decisions in consultation with all members of the House .
as the parliamentary secretary has made clear Devco ' s mandate is still commercial viability .
we expect projects to go forward on the basis of commercial viability .
in other words , if the Donkin mine is to be developed it will have to be on a commercial basis .
the word true has a certain air of quality about it in this hallowed Chamber .
it is a versatile word .
this is particularly true given the government ' s record of fiscal responsibility to all Canadians .
in his magnificent , magnanimous , munificent budget last February , the Minister of Finance indicated that the government would stay the course on its effort to eliminate that terrible and dreadful thing called the deficit .
Canadians recognize and appreciate that progress has been made in this regard .
hon. members will recall that the previous minister of natural resources , during an appearance before a special Senate committee this past March , indicated that she would entertain private sector proposals to study the feasibility of developing the Donkin mine .
the government fully supports Devco ' s decision to allow the private sector to explore development of the Donkin mine on a commercial basis .
as hon. members have been informed , a private company , Donkin Resources Ltd. , is currently conducting a feasibility study to examine the availability and quality of the coal deposit , the market opportunities and the technical details associated with opening the mine .
the study was financially supported by the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency through a contribution to the Cape Breton County Economic Development Authority .
this contribution -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
all hon. members share with the Chair the disappointment that the time provided for private members ' hour has expired .
however , with unanimous consent of the members present , perhaps the mover of the motion , the hon. member for Bras D ' Or , could have three minutes to sum up .
is there unanimous consent ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , I still have not received an answer to the question of whether or not members on the government side support the motion .
one of the topics he just discussed was the feasibility study which is going to be done with federal funds .
he talked about the agencies which have approved this funding , ACOA and ECBC .
what I have to tell this member is that there was one group that was not asked what it cared about or what it thought about this situation , and that group was the people of Cape Breton Island .
they were not asked .
where else could this situation exist ?
in a country that is supposed to be so prosperous we have an island which has the highest rate of unemployment in the country .
there is the possibility of a major employer and it is being sold for a loonie .
i ask the member , where ?
under this Liberal government that is how it happened .
as I said in my speech , the Donkin mine is the future of Devco and Devco is the future of Cape Breton Island .
i will continue , day after day , to remind this government when it talks about deficit reduction how it accomplished that deficit reduction .
it accomplished it on the backs of the people of Cape Breton Island .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
the time provided for the consideration of Private Members ' Business has now expired and the order is dropped from the Order Paper .
it being 2.06 p.m. , this House stands adjourned until Monday at 11 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
( the House adjourned at 2.06 p.m. )

criminal CODE
madam Speaker , last week Gallup released the results of its most recent survey on Canadian support for the death penalty .
according to that poll , if a national referendum were to be held today a full 63 % of the Canadian public would vote in favour of reinstating capital punishment .
the Reform Party believes that on moral and contentious issues such as capital punishment Canadians should grapple with their own consciences and vote according to their personal convictions in a binding national referendum .
we have called for a binding referendum on the death penalty but the government has said no .
the government has told the people that it knows what is best for them and that they do not have the choice .
that is why I have introduced the bill .
if the government will not hold a binding referendum at the time of the next federal election , I believe we should hold a true free vote in the House of Commons where all MPs can vote the views of their constituents rather than those of their political bosses or their own personal beliefs .
that would be democracy .
the bill imposes a sentence of capital punishment on all adults found guilty of first degree murder .
first degree murder occurs when a murder is planned and deliberate , when death occurs during a sexual assault or kidnapping , or when the victim is a police officer or a correctional officer .
to address the concerns people have about the finality of the death penalty important safeguards have been built into the legislation .
there is an automatic right of appeal at the first level .
even if convicted people themselves do not appeal they are deemed to have appealed and the court will review the case on all questions of fact and law to determine if the conviction is valid .
all appeals are to be conducted in a timely fashion .
if the jury and court are satisfied that overwhelming evidence shows someone is guilty beyond doubt there is no reason he or she should languish on death row for years .
the sentence , if upheld , is to be carried out within a reasonable period of time .
the death penalty is to be carried out by lethal injection .
this is a more humane method of execution than hanging or electrocution .
it ensures a quick and painless end and does not turn the culmination of a tragic chain of events begun by a brutal murder into a media and public circus .
the death penalty should be reinstated for many reasons .
first and foremost is that the state must protect society .
in this debate we cannot forget the inevitable release of murderers .
it is clear that our so - called rehabilitation programs are not working .
two convicted murderers also escaped , only to murder again .
how does one explain to the families of those victims that 12 murderers were given the opportunity to strike again ?
how could anyone possibly defend our justice system to the family of just one of these victims ?
while there are 12 examples that I could use , I draw the attention of the House to one in particular .
he escaped , only to murder four more law - abiding innocent Canadians .
i am certain that someone here today will raise the cases of Donald Marshall , Guy Paul Morin and David Milgaard .
all three of these men spent years of their lives behind bars , convicted of crimes they did not commit .
this is not something any Canadian is proud of .
my hope is that their years of needless suffering and incarceration have taught us a grave lesson about how easily justice can be subverted .
their hard won battles have exposed problems in our system that we must be ever vigilant to avoid repeating .
when local police departments are under enormous public pressure to produce a guilty party , that is when we must scrutinize the evidence presented with an even more critical eye .
no one should be convicted of first degree murder and put to death based on circumstantial evidence .
we now have much improved DNA technology .
these high profile cases have alerted the public and the justice system to the possibility of overzealous police forces seeking speedy convictions .
David Milgaard was convicted of second degree murder so he never would have faced the death penalty in any case .
under the bill all evidence and facts would have been carefully re - examined in the convictions of Guy Paul Morin and Donald Marshall .
they were recently exonerated on the basis of DNA evidence .
if their trials had been held today they would have never been convicted .
the DNA tests that proved them innocent could just as easily prove , beyond a shadow of a doubt , someone else ' s guilt .
we are entering the 21 st century and our justice system should use the latest technology to determine the guilt or innocence of those charged .
in 1996 the homicide rate was 2.11 per 100,000 .
whether we measure it from 1966 or 1975 it is still far too many .
another statistic is much more relevant to the debate today .
i quote from a recent Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics publication known as Juristat .
however , in 1996 , 361 people were charged with first degree murder even though there were 28 fewer murders committed in 1996 than in 1978 .
obviously something has changed if the proportion of planned and deliberate murders has increased by over 50 % since capital punishment was abolished in 1976 .
we should not consider the use of the death penalty out of hunger for vengeance but out of desire for justice .
no act of vengeance can undo the harm done .
no punishment can erase a victim ' s scars or bring back those who were murdered .
the death penalty is not about vengeance .
it is not the business of the state to exact punishment motivated by vengeance .
it is the role of the state to mete out justice .
capital punishment is about public safety .
the only certain way to keep extremely dangerous individuals from harming again and again is to take away their opportunity to do so .
why is it wrong for society to take the life of someone who has knowingly violated our most fundamental laws and brutally slain a fellow human being ?
in 1982 one - third of the 300 convicted murderers in Canada said they would prefer the death penalty over life in prison .
in fact , in 1983 a convicted murdered in Saskatchewan formally requested the death penalty by lethal injection on the basis that his life sentence was cruel and unusual punishment .
his request was denied by the court .
some people believe we should just lock up murderers capable of the most heinous crimes for a few decades .
some of these people object to the death penalty strictly on moral grounds .
that is their right and I believe they should be given the opportunity to voice that view in a referendum .
i take issue with those who object to the death penalty because they fear our justice system may have convicted an innocent person .
if you believe innocent people are being convicted , do not just object to the death penalty .
it is equally wrong to keep an innocent person in jail for 10 or 20 years .
those who believe our justice system does not work have a moral obligation to reform it , to protect all innocent people , not just those facing a possible death penalty .
there is no question there are problems with our justice system .
according to our laws , taking a human life is wrong .
maybe people believe the second degree conviction of Tracy Latimer ' s father was warranted , but others believe it points to the need for different charges in the Criminal Code .
i do not know whether the Minister of Justice is considering something like a mercy killing category , but if she is I strongly urge her to include a significant range of sentencing options to reflect all Canadians ' moral convictions on this highly contentious issue .
under the current system the sentencing judge has little latitude in sentencing Latimer .
some Canadians agree with this while others do not .
let me bring another murder case to the attention of the House today .
on Vancouver Island a man was murdered and his murderer walked .
there was no public hue and cry to jail the perpetrator because the victim was apparently an undesirable person .
because people did not seem to generally like the victim , they demanded little or no punishment for the criminal .
that is not right .
somehow I believe our justice system forgot that its role is to protect all citizens , even those we do not like .
as a society we cannot let individuals take the law into their own hands .
we must prevent vigilantism and have room for compassion for those who act out of mercy , not malice .
the state should have the option of imposing the severest of penalties for the most heinous of crimes to protect the citizens .
there is no way to bring the victim back .
Paul Bernardo may not be getting out for a long time , but his accomplice will be getting out very soon .
Clifford Olson may have failed in his bid for parole this summer , but eventually he too may be released into our streets , into the neighbourhoods where our children are at play .
do you want people capable of rape , torture and murder living next to you ?
do you want to take the chance with your children and grandchildren ?
when they get out , not if , do not count on them moving to someone else ' s neighbourhood .
the death penalty may not act as a deterrent for sick individuals bent on the destruction of other human beings , but if the death penalty does not deter them , neither does the prospect of imprisonment for 15 , 20 or 25 years .
deterrence is not the issue .
seventy percent of Canadians who supported the death penalty in 1996 said they would still support it even if it was proven not to be a deterrent .
instead , the majority of Canadians believe that capital punishment is for the protection of society .
in summary , I believe the death penalty should be reinstated for those guilty of heinous first degree murders .
this bill provides ample opportunity for appeals on the basis of fact and law with the option of commuting the sentence to life imprisonment .
capital punishment should be available to society to protect the citizens from those who have shown no remorse , no guilt and no possibility of redemption .
the appeals process and the sentence are to be carried out in a timely fashion .
administering a lethal injection is more humane than hanging or electrocution and does not reduce the death sentence to a media spectacle .
i and the Reform Party believe that Canadian people should decide on whether they want to reinstate capital punishment in a binding national referendum , as I said earlier .
because the government has said no , as I also said earlier , the next best thing is a free vote in the House of Commons .
sixty - three per cent of Canadians want the death penalty reinstated .
it is the duty of members of this House to carry out the will of their constituents .
therefore , I would seek unanimous consent of the members present to make Bill C - 212 votable .
an hon. member :
democracy denied as usual .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion ?
some hon. members :
No.
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
denied .
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( London West , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I feel compelled to participate in this debate on Bill C - 212 which was introduced by the hon. member for Prince George - Peace River .
bill C - 212 would reinstate the death penalty for first degree murder committed by a person 18 years of age or over .
this bill would also provide for an increase in prison terms for first and second degree murder which can be imposed upon persons under the age of 18 .
i would like first to address the issue of reinstatement of the death penalty .
capital punishment was debated extensively in this House prior to the 1976 vote that abolished it more than 20 years ago .
capital punishment has been debated a few times since it was abolished , not only in Parliament , but elsewhere .
the most extensive debate since the abolition of capital punishment took place in this House in 1987 .
i clearly remember that debate because , as a private citizen , it was the first time that I actually wrote to my MP to encourage him to vote against capital punishment .
the 1987 debate was on the then government of the day motion and that motion called upon the House of Commons to support in principle the reinstatement of capital punishment and to establish a special committee to provide recommendations on the offences which should carry the death penalty , and on the method or methods which should be used to carry out the sentence of death .
the question as I said earlier was debated at length .
there was a free vote in this House .
it seems that some people cannot understand that a free vote democratically given in Canada has been done and it was refused .
some people push the agenda all the time .
a majority of the members then voted against the motion and thus against the reinstatement of capital punishment in the Criminal Code .
since that vote , capital punishment has not been an issue of great national prominence .
why are we asked to debate the reinstatement of capital punishment at this time ?
it is private members hour and a Reform member has brought it forward .
are there any new circumstances that require or seriously say that Parliament should re - examine this issue ?
perhaps I would understand if there was a trend showing a significant increase in the homicide rate .
this could institute a requirement that we should again debate this issue and would justify reopening this debate on the death penalty .
surely the hon. member from Prince George - Peace River is not motivated by an increase in the homicide rate .
in fact the rate for 1996 is the third lowest rate since 1975 .
the homicide rate was three per hundred thousand of population in 1975 , the last year when capital punishment was in force for murder .
in 1987 when this House held an extensive debate on a government motion for the reinstatement of capital punishment , the homicide rate was down to 2.4 per hundred thousand , which means a 20 % decrease compared to 1975 .
for 1996 the rate is 2.1 .
i want to be clear .
i do not underestimate , nor does anybody in this House , the crime of murder .
today we are all aware of yet another tragedy in Canada over the weekend .
every homicide is a tragedy and it raises questions about our society and raises questions for our society .
every homicide or murder must be punished with the most serious penalties and it is .
however , statistics do show us that the homicide rate was three per one hundred thousand of population when capital punishment was in force and it is down to around two per one hundred thousand now that capital punishment is no longer in our system , having been abolished , as I said , for over 20 years .
this decrease hardly supports the deterrent element of capital punishment .
not only has the homicide rate not increased with the abolition of the death penalty , it has actually decreased by one - third .
what these statistics mean is that there is no evidence that the death penalty is a useful tool to fight murders .
if the death penalty is not an effective tool against homicides and murders , we should ask ourselves what useful purpose would be served by reinstating it .
i personally believe that the death penalty is an excessive means of achieving the objectives of sentencing .
in recent years at least three well publicized cases have come to light which would cause one to pause and should cause this society to pause when considering the reinstatement of the death penalty : the wrongful murder convictions of Donald Marshall , Jr. , Guy - Paul Morin and David Milgaard .
if capital punishment had been in effect , they may not have had a second chance at life .
capital punishment is final .
there is no chance to correct the mistakes of the state , however well intentioned , however strongly we feel and however many inches of press can be generated .
this type of error is also tragic and it is totally preventable when we do not have capital punishment as part of our recourse in our justice system .
on practical grounds , these are reasons I personally oppose the death penalty .
the onus is on those who would want to change the law in such a fundamental way to make a compelling case .
for myself , I am not persuaded by the arguments I have just heard and those being made .
it is not only on practical grounds that I oppose the death penalty , but I also oppose it on moral grounds .
the issue of capital punishment raises the question of how we see ourselves as a country and a people .
the trend in the world , at least among western nations , is to abolish the death penalty .
do Canadians really believe that they would feel safer living in a society where capital punishment is meted out ?
in fact to be very crass , do they even believe that this would save tax dollars ?
the hon. member ' s bill would also increase prison terms for murder for persons under the age of 18 years .
i found it surprising that he did not address that , seeing as that is part of the bill , but I am going to comment .
i would like to remind the hon. member that parole eligibility periods for youth convicted of murder were significantly increased as of December 1 , 1995 .
i would like to outline for the House the provisions that currently apply to young offenders who are found guilty of murder .
a youth who is 14 years of age or over at the time of the commission of the offence of first degree murder or second degree murder may be transferred to adult court .
if convicted of murder in adult court , the minimum sentence is life imprisonment .
before December 1 , 1995 a youth convicted of either first or second degree murder in adult court was subject to a prison term set by the court at between five and ten years inclusive .
since our government changed this law after December 1 , 1995 , the following provisions apply .
if not specified by the judge , then the person must serve a term of five years .
it is unfortunate that I am out of time because I do have the facts that could be presented .
maybe one of my colleagues will finish this .
right now I need to make the point that all youth convicted of first degree murder in youth court are subject to a maximum sentence of ten years which is comprised of a maximum of six years in custody and a maximum length of conditional supervision of four years .
youths convicted of second degree murder in youth court are subject to a maximum sentence of seven years which is composed of a maximum period of four years in custody and a period of conditional supervision which may not exceed three years .
it has only been two years since we have changed these rules .
we have a justice committee looking at it .
i am going to suggest that we let the Minister of Justice , who knows this is an important issue , deal with this as we have been doing all along .
we take this seriously .
in my submission , capital punishment plays no part in our just society .
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , I would first like to commend the mover of this piece of legislation for the work that has gone into it .
i read his private member ' s bill today and it is clear that a considerable amount of effort has gone into drafting the legislation .
i commend him for that but , and I am sure this will come as no surprise to him , I disagree with the contents of the legislation and the thrust of the private member ' s bill to reinstate capital punishment in this country and , as my hon. colleague just mentioned , to require life imprisonment for certain young offenders charged and convicted of first degree murder .
in the introduction and debate of this piece of legislation , I find it interesting that the hon. member said that this is not about vengeance .
he indicated that vengeance plays no part in seeking the death penalty .
he went on to say that it was not about deterrence .
my hon. colleague , who spoke prior to me , indicated that the statistics are there and there is no evidence that capital punishment acts as a deterrent to murderers .
therefore , if it is not about vengeance or deterrence , what is the purpose of the legislation ?
the mover says it is about safety .
i presume what he means is that if we take a person who is convicted of first degree murder and execute them they are not going to commit murder a second time .
the reality is that in this country we have life imprisonment .
the reality is that the Paul Bernardos and Clifford Olsons , who are talked about by the mover of this bill , will not be released from prison .
the purpose of prison is safety .
if we can achieve the purpose of safety through prison then what is the point of execution ?
if we can achieve safety in a more humane and civilized way then surely the hon. member will agree , if vengeance is not part of the issue , and if safety can be achieved in another way , that is the way we should proceed .
an hon. member :
don ' t count on it .
Mr. Peter Mancini :
i am not .
that being said , consequently there is no necessary rationale for the legislation that has been brought into the House today .
i submit we can achieve safety in a better way and as a better society .
if we went to Canadians and said that the people who are convicted of first degree murder in the most heinous circumstances will not be released from prison unless they avail themselves of Canadians ' will to release them through an application under the faint hope clause , Canadians would say fine , if safety is the issue and we know we are safe .
as I have indicated , I think the rationale is then gone for the piece of legislation .
i ask him , then , if public opinion is the rationale , will he put a caveat into his legislation and say we want the death penalty but we are going to review it as public opinion shifts ?
perhaps in three years if 55 % of the Canadian population according to some poll says we do not want capital punishment , we will reintroduce the legislation -
an hon. member :
it never happened .
Mr. Peter Mancini :
the hon. mover says that it has never happened .
an hon. member :
public opinion .
Mr. Peter Mancini :
exactly .
let us change each piece of legislation every year , depending on whether or not certain groups can present their case on television and in the media and gain the most public opinion .
those people who were put to death between let us say 1997 and the year 2000 when the legislation might come up for review , well , they were on the wrong side of public opinion for three years .
we will change it again in 2000 and we will not have the death penalty .
maybe in 2010 we will change it again and those people between 2000 and 2010 , good for them , they won the lottery .
we are allowing the Gallup poll to determine legislation in Parliament where I believe we have been elected to represent our constituents ' interests but also to lead this country into the next millennium .
that is our purpose and I think that is what we have to do .
we now know there is no rationale for the piece of legislation .
we now know it is being led by public opinion and that is the purpose of it , I suppose , to gain some points in another Gallup poll .
it would be Reform justice , I suppose .
we know that jurors can err but I raise another point and I think it is an important point .
in many states in America , our neighbours to the south , there is capital punishment .
the reality of what happens in study after study is that juries are reluctant to convict if they know the death penalty is what awaits the accused .
the mover of this legislation has talked about the Latimer case and it is interesting to note that jurors who convicted Mr. Latimer interviewed later on , and this is no secret , it was used by his defence council , indicated that had they known that the minimum sentence was 10 years , they would have entered a verdict of not guilty .
if we accept the statistics of my hon. friend , and I am not sure I do , let us suppose that 40 % of Canadians on moral grounds opposed the death penalty , if they sit on the jury and cannot morally accede to the death penalty if it is law , they are left with no choice but to acquit .
i ask the mover of this legislation to think about that very carefully because it is a very real consequence in states where there is a death penalty .
the other side of this in reality is the frustration in the legal system .
the bill makes provision for a mandatory appeal .
it is a very American piece of legislation .
i think we have to say that what we are doing here is free trade on certain kinds of justice issues .
we are importing American legislation into this country , into a judicial system and a court structured system that is British in nature .
let us be clear .
we are trying to put a round peg into a square hole here and it is not going to fit .
if we do look to the American states where this type of legislation is in place , we see case after case where the appeals are dragged out for years .
it is a fight for someone ' s life .
make no mistake , there are organizations in this country that would find funding to continue appeal after appeal , to look for clemency to move on .
i think we have to look at the reality of this .
it is nice and easy to say this solves the problem , we are going to have an execution after we seek leave to appeal .
since I have one minute left , I will try to wrap up .
like my colleague , there is so much to say on this issue that I could speak for a fairly long period of time .
however , let me say that I find it absolutely contradictory and somewhat upsetting that the mover of this legislation would say that we are in favour of this and that we are going to do it nice and clean , in a way that nobody is really bothered , it will not be a public spectacle .
to those in favour of capital punishment , I say bring the accused into this Chamber , execute him here , watch him foul himself in this House , eye to eye , and then let them tell me that they are in favour .
i have not touched on the young offender areas of the bill , nor have I touched on an interesting little section that requires the body of the person who has been executed to be buried within the prison .
and my friend says that this is not couched in vengeance .
so much for Christian mercy .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to speak on this bill put forward by the Reform Party .
there is nothing surprising about this bill , considering that the Reform Party had tabled a bill during the 35 th Parliament -
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , on a point of order .
this bill is not a Reform bill .
this is my bill , the member for Prince George - Peace River , a private member ' s motion .
private members ' motions and bills do not come from a party .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
resuming debate .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
madam Speaker , the hon. member from the West may be ashamed of his party .
indeed , this is a private member ' s bill .
some of us are capable of making that distinction .
that said , during the 35 th Parliament another hon. member from the Reform Party tabled a bill proposing a referendum on the death penalty .
it will be recalled that there was a debate in this House .
outside of the Reform members , hon. members voted without exception against that bill .
i would remind the hon. member that the bill in question was C - 261 .
the Reform MPs were in favour of the bill , while all the rest of the House was against it .
today -
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , on a point of order .
in the 35 th Parliament the bill which was just mentioned by the hon. member was my bill .
it was not a Reform bill .
reform policy is not quite the same as what is coming forward in these bills .
so he needs to get his facts right .
i do not mind if he criticizes private members ' bills , but do not attach those directly to the party .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
resuming debate .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
madam Speaker , things are not going well for the Reform Party , because a second member has just dissociated himself from the party .
things are not going well .
there are another four or five who may do the same .
the crime is no less serious , but people under 18 years of age who have committed first degree murder , for example , would serve a life sentence .
they are amending the Criminal Code by replacing section 235 of the Criminal Code - and I think it important every word of this bill be understood - with the following :
every one who commits first degree murder is guilty of an indictable offence and shall be sentenced
( a ) to death , where the person was eighteen years of age or more at the time of the commission of the offence ; or
( b ) to imprisonment for life where the person was under the age of eighteen at the time of the commission of the offence .
as we can see , there are two elements to be amended , namely , the Criminal Code with respect to capital punishment and the Young Offenders Act .
in the case of the Criminal Code , all of us in this House know that there was a big debate on the subject in 1975 - 76 , when Canada still had capital punishment .
they wanted to amend it .
there was a moral debate , with the church involved , a political and a social debate .
i think there was a very important debate in 1975 - 76 on that .
a compromise was reached , because they abolished capital punishment .
the compromise was life imprisonment , with the possibility of parole after 25 years .
it was perhaps not the best formula , but it was the most accurate representation of the will of the people at the time .
you have to understand that people , that a society , that a country can change .
maybe not the Reform Party , but everyone else .
today we do not think exactly the same way we did 25 , 30 or 40 years ago .
i think it is normal in a free and democratic society to deal with this , especially since with the help of experts and the people involved , we can review much more objectively the whole situation , which is rather unpleasant , I must admit .
there is nothing pleasant about first degree murder .
when we read the newspapers , there is nothing pleasant there neither , but I believe that in a society like ours , we had to get to the bottom of this .
that is what we did during those years and we arrived at a rather satisfactory formula .
however , we improved it over the years .
recently , I think we solved still other problems by amending the Criminal Code so an individual can be declared a dangerous offender and denied the possibility of parole .
perhaps there will be further improvements over the years , but it surely will not be by going to extremes , as the Reform member wants to do this morning with Bill C - 212 , and by imposing capital punishment for first degree murder .
i would like to read to you some of the objectives we have here .
why did we go from capital punishment to the system we have today ?
France and other European countries had the same social debate we had here and finally adopted legislation resembling Canada ' s .
the judge should base his sentence on the objective and subjective seriousness of the offense so that the sentence is fair and in line with the offense and the offender .
he should think about the objectives to be achieved by imposing a sentence .
the sentence should be a deterrent for the accused and set an example for the people in the community , the region and even , in some cases , the province .
but the sentence should also consider the actual or potential rehabilitation of the offender .
the objectives that the judge has to consider are the following : the protection of society , retribution , deterrence , example , and the social rehabilitation of the offender and his protection against other sanctions .
considering all this , I believe that the present system strikes a balance and , as I was saying earlier , further improvements can always be made .
another reason to oppose this bill - and I am saying this on a personal basis today , but also , knowing rather well my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois , I believe there are a number of them that agree with me - is the possibility of an error in the judicial system .
this is an extremely important reason and I think that even though our judicial system has proven itself , it is not infallible .
no one in this House is infallible either .
no judge is infallible , and I think there may be cases where individuals are found guilty who are not really guilty .
in Canada , we have seen people spend 5 , 10 or 15 years in jail who were later found to have been unfairly convicted and who were released after their files were reopened and a new investigation was conducted .
i know that with the progress made in the medical field and in other fields , we can make the judicial system better or try to reduce the risk of mistakes being made , and I am referring here to deoxyribonucleic acid analysis , better known as DNA analysis .
such analyses may be used to link a given individual to a murder based on evidence found on the scene of the crime .
but even the best techniques will not prevent mistakes from being made and individuals from being convicted of murder in the first degree .
if this House passed the hon. member ' s bill , these people would be executed , when it may be found ten years down the road that they were not guilty of the crimes they were accused of .
criminal lawyers are not unanimous , but the vast majority of them , including Gis 猫 le C 么 t 茅 - Harper , Antoine Manganas and Jean Turgeon , say that capital punishment does not have a deterrent effect in the case of first degree murder .
to conclude , as far as young offenders are concerned , the proposed amendment to the Young Offenders Act would completely upset the balance of this legislation .
for these additional reasons , I am opposed to the hon. member ' s bill .
Mr. Ted White ( North Vancouver , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I have listened with interest to the debate this morning .
during the last Parliament , as I mentioned earlier , I put forward a bill which requested , consistent with Reform policy , a binding referendum on this issue .
it requested a binding referendum of the public , which has in polls , as other members have mentioned , consistently voted 65 % or higher for the past 30 years in favour of the death penalty being reinstated .
that is one thing which has not changed with time .
an hon. member mentioned how times have changed and how issues have changed but the fact is that public opinion on this issue has not changed .
we have to do something to bring those two positions more closely together .
one obvious way to do it is to involve the public in a referendum .
there would be extensive public debate .
everybody would have the opportunity to put forward their point of view .
in the end the community would make the decision about how it wants the country to run .
an hon. member grossly exaggerated about the way referenda work , saying we would be into referenda every year , that every five minutes there would be a referendum .
that is a lot of rubbish .
i would challenge that member to point to a place anywhere in the world where referenda are common and where that happens .
even Switzerland which has numerous referenda per month in the cantons simply does not get into the silly nonsense which the member mentioned of constantly revisiting issues .
certainly they revisit issues but the timeframe tends to be a lot longer .
several years is not uncommon for a change in attitudes to alter something which needs to be brought forward in a referendum .
the fact is that a referendum is a very good tool for getting public opinion .
there is a decent length of time to discuss the issue .
at the moment it certainly looks as if the public would vote for the return of capital punishment .
in discussions with my own constituents , because the majority of people in my riding favour its return , I have asked them what sort of checks and balances they would put in place if they were to vote to have capital punishment returned .
what checks and balances would they have to avoid accidentally giving the death penalty to somebody who was innocent ?
if the death penalty were to be returned the suggestion would be that the jury have the power to recommend to the judge the death penalty .
it would not be automatic .
it would be a recommendation of the jury .
that overcomes one of the problems which was identified by one of the members where juries are afraid to convict people on that basis .
this suggestion was given to me by one of my constituents .
if we are ever faced with this situation we may get into that dialogue .
if a jury was to have the power to recommend that sort of thing , then the judge is the final check and balance in accepting or rejecting the recommendation .
i realize the bill before us today does not make provision for that .
if we were into a referendum type situation a lot of these suggestions would come forward .
it is important to remember that .
another member mentioned that the trend was away from capital punishment .
in the United States , which is our closest neighbour , more and more states have been reintroducing capital punishment .
crime authorities are coming down harder and harder on crime and it is working .
for example , in New York City the police commissioner , who is an elected official in the United States , some years ago decided he would take a zero tolerance policy with respect to youth crime and general crime in the subways .
he ordered the police to arrest people even if they so much as spit on the sidewalk or put up a bit of graffiti .
within a very few months that zero tolerance sent a message to the drug dealers , the murderers , the rapists that crime would not be tolerated and crime dropped dramatically on the New York subways .
as a result that police commissioner was elected to become the mayor of the city .
he introduced much tougher crime control and the murder rate dropped something like 35 % in about six months .
there was a program on television about this recently .
a woman who lived in one of the black ghettos said that in her entire lifetime of 30 years she had never had a day when there were not gunshots fired until that mayor was elected and had a zero tolerance on crime and started to clean up the way society was operating .
there is a desire in society to get control of these criminal elements .
i look at youth crime in my area where graffiti is rampant .
i have been in Canada since 1979 .
in Vancouver graffiti was almost unknown then .
when I came to Ottawa in 1993 there was hardly any graffiti .
if we had the same zero tolerance approach to things like youth crime , we would be in a much better situation today than we are .
this bill represents a desire by the public to see their government , which is us , recognize their concerns and get back to zero tolerance of these crimes .
if we do not step down hard on things like graffiti , then we will naturally have to accept all sorts of serious crimes .
we saw on the weekend in Victoria where a 14 year old girl was murdered by a group of her peers .
we have to get the message across that we are not prepared to accept this type of crime .
despite what some members have claimed there has been very consistent public opinion on the issue .
they want to see us return capital punishment to the law books .
the fact remains that this place is out of step with those people and that members who stand and arrogantly say they will defy the will of their constituents are doing them no service whatsoever .
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
in the short five minutes that I am given by the process to sum up , I would like to try to make as many points as possible to rebut some of what was said by the other representatives of the parties .
first , it is key to note that the hon. member for London West , as well as others , denied the ability to put this very important issue to a vote .
in other words justice denied has been justice denied once more in the House .
it is my position and the position of a lot of people in the Reform Party of Canada that all Private Members ' Business should be put to a vote whether it is a private member ' s bill or motion .
second , I call the attention of the viewing public , or anyone who wants to follow the debate and do a little research on it , to the fact that the comments made by the hon. member for London West almost followed word by word the comments made by one of her former colleagues , Mr. Gordon Kirkby , who at the time was the parliamentary secretary to the minister of justice , as reported in Hansard of May 14 , 1996 , for anyone who would care to look up the speech .
an hon. member :
what happened to him ?
Mr. Jay Hill :
what happened to him ?
in reply to the hon. member for the NDP , he made some statement to the effect that if we could achieve public safety without capital punishment then why put in capital punishment .
i would like the hon. member to remember that when he says that some of these animals - and that is what I call them - will never ever be released from prison .
obviously some of them are released because they are repeat offenders .
in reply to the hon. member of the Bloc Quebecois , it is unfortunate that one of my colleagues and I found it necessary to rise on points of order during his intervention .
i do not like to see that happen during debate on Private Members ' Business , but his comments clearly indicate that the Bloc Quebecois has no clue as to what Private Members ' Business is all about .
quite simply Private Members ' Business , whether a motion or a bill , is for the private member .
that is why those that are deemed votable are put to a supposed free vote in the House of Commons .
it is not supposed to be along party lines .
therefore the member ' s comments about the fact that we wanted to dissociate ourselves from the Reform Party is simply not true .
i am trying to represent my constituents , and even though it is not Reform Party policy I am bringing it forward .
i notice that I have but one minute left .
it is such a short period of time to debate such an important issue .
speakers from all parties said likewise .
in reply to the statement made by the NDP , it has never fallen below 50 % that the Canadian people speak consistently in favour of reinstating capital punishment .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the time provided for the consideration of Private Members ' Business has now expired and the order is dropped from the order paper .
government ORDERS
anti - PERSONNEL MINES CONVENTION IMPLEMENTATION ACT
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i believe you would find unanimous consent for the order that , after second reading , Bill C - 22 will be referred to a committee of the whole , that the House shall be permitted to consider all stages of the bill in this sitting and that , if the bill has not been disposed of at the ordinary time of adjournment , it shall continue to sit until it does dispose of the bill .
there is also agreement that if the House does sit after 6.30 p.m. , no quorum calls or dilatory motions shall be received .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
does the hon. member have unanimous consent of the House to move the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the House has heard the terms of the motion .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
( motion agreed to )
madam Speaker , I am very happy this morning to join with members of Parliament in commenting on the second reading of a law which would put in place the convention banning the use of anti - personnel land mines .
first of all , I wish to thank all members of the House for co - operating in the speedy passage of this bill .
i would like to emphasize that all political parties are prepared to work together to pass this bill today .
this , to me , says much about the Parliament of Canada .
each day , our views on taxes , the environment , the Constitution and so forth may differ widely , but when it comes to debating a bill to save children and help innocent victims , we can work together .
this is an important message to Canadians and an appeal to parliamentarians the world over to move swiftly to eliminate anti - personnel mines .
over the last several years members on both sides have expressed themselves very eloquently and very forcefully on the matter .
i see in the Chamber today a number of members who have personally taken on the cause and have worked actively to pursue it .
it is important that we act together as a parliament to demonstrate that we are in a good position when countries come to Ottawa next week to sign the treaty .
the Prime Minister can be the first to turn over to the UN secretary general a ratification and begin the second part of the process .
it will not just be the signature but the actual ratification .
within a matter of a few short months a basic minimum of 40 countries will have ratified the treaty , at which point it will become a binding international law requiring signatory countries to live up to its conditions .
this movement has an interesting history .
it began with the enormous expression of will among thousands of individuals around the world .
it is a prime example of the new face and fact of international politics .
it is no longer just governments that make decisions .
it is what I have called the global commons , the new democracy of the international arena where NGOs , civil organizations and individuals are united together through the power of the new systems of telecommunications and information banded together over the years to draw to the attention of governments what a scourge this weapon is and how malicious it is in its application .
i have seen nothing in my personal experience that more aptly demonstrates the evil that works in the minds of men than what I saw in Lebanon a week ago .
the mines were not designed for military purposes but clearly to entice young children to pick them up .
the mere heat of their hands would detonate them and they would lose a limb such as an arm .
we are in a position today to take a stand against that kind of human malevolence .
we called together for a meeting 13 months ago in Ottawa like - minded countries and NGOs to see what we could do to take advantage of the mobilization of public opinion around the world and to take advantage of the extraordinary effort of NGOs .
it became clear the conventional pathways would not work .
the normal corridors of disarmament discussion were becoming cul - de - sacs .
they were closed off to any meaningful approval .
at that point we challenged the countries of the world to come to Ottawa a year later to sign a treaty .
in the first instance , if one had gauged the reaction , it was more scepticism and sometimes outright scoffing that any such thing could happen .
it was just not the way things were done .
the proof is that next week we expect over 100 countries to be in Ottawa to sign the treaty .
it shows a new sense of public participation in developing significant initiative in the international arena .
it is now one of the most powerful , important and significant developments of our time .
it is a great commentary and tribute to members of Parliament and their work in various parliamentary associations around the world .
i recall resolutions being passed by groups like the IPU , the NATO assembly , and others .
members have also played their own part in mobilizing that effort .
in some cases the onus has clearly moved on to parliamentary systems around the world .
it is now clearly within parliaments that ratification must take place .
it is important to point out that what was dubbed the Ottawa process is not simply a signature on a piece of paper .
it is not simply the fact of the treaty .
it is the fact that countries will be coming here not only to indicate their adherence to the new convention but to become actively involved in discussing how we can make it work .
what we can now call the Ottawa process II is designed to bring countries together , to mobilize resources for de - mining and to use the effort that went into placing mines to now removing them .
there are 110 million land mines around the world , 600 to 800 casualties a month , and 80 % of the victims are civilian , children and other innocents .
again , if I can just use a personal moment of when I was in the Golan Heights last week .
our own peacekeepers , Canadians , along with Austrians and Japanese were required to undertake their duties in an unmarked area land mass so that each step was a potential disaster .
only about a week before I arrived , a young Austrian soldier lost his leg .
here was a prime example of how the weapons themselves are not just a threat to fire up lands but in fact pose a danger to our own Canadian peacekeepers around the world .
this is why our own army and our armed forces have taken such an active role in places like Cambodia and Bosnia to try to eliminate the land mines .
i think members of the foreign affairs committee who have just returned from Bosnia can speak for the fact themselves that that country , as real as it is with land mines , its ability to redevelop , to recreate some economic life and substance is substantially hindered because of the threat and fear that the next step may be one ' s last .
who will go and plant a new crop when the plough may hit a land mine and end forever the life or certainly maim the individual ?
the two purposes of the Ottawa meeting are to bring countries to sign the treaty and also to mobilize money , skill , commitment and engagement so that around the world they can engage in the massive test of taking mines out of the ground , of helping to rehabilitate the victims , not just to replace their limbs but also to help them restore a healthier view of life .
nothing can be more traumatic for a young child who has been maimed by a land mine , to restore a sense of some confidence that the world is still a humane place and that the adult world still believes in them , and also to help the countries which have been marred and scarred by land mines to begin the slow process of redevelopment .
that will not happen overnight .
that will take years but we can use the meetings in Ottawa next week to be the catalyst , to start that process and to begin to engage the commitment and the resources of countries around the world to begin the massive task of taking out land mines .
some have said , and there are always comments and critics , that the land mine treaty does not include some of the big players , the United States , China , India , but it is important to note that it is already having its impact .
china has declared a moratorium on exports as has the United States .
the Prime Minister , in his talks with President Yeltsin in Russia , confirmed that they would continue to provide a moratorium and may be prepared to come to sign .
it is interesting that even countries that are still in some ways in a state of conflict , Syria and Israel , have committed to come to the conference itself to begin exploring how they can become part of the broad movement to eliminate the world from land mines .
i am not expecting miracles .
they will be part of the discussions .
again , I would encourage colleagues in the House who will have opportunities to meet with these delegates and talk to them , to begin to look and to explore how we can work together with many of these countries to undertake projects in which we can help de - mine the Golan Heights or to eliminate the sources of conflict in Cyprus or wherever the case may be , where the mines themselves have become part of the problem .
it is also true to say that a lot of work will have to be done in the area of developing more effective technologies to get rid of land mines .
nothing is more primitive to me than watching a de - mining activity where trained people are literally out on the fields with a steel rod probing the ground in the hope that that prod will not hit the trigger and detonate the mine and then have to go through the painstaking exercise of slowly clearing the mines .
i do believe that there is , in the sense of our own technical excellence in countries around the world , the capacity and the will to develop new needs by which we can begin to eliminate these mines and to begin to help the countries affected by them .
i will give one example that struck me as absolutely astounding .
i think it is probably a well known fact that there is a new book out called Aftermath that talks about the consequences of war and what happens to it .
France , one of the most sophisticated , civilized countries in the world , 75 years after the first world war , is still engaged in an active campaign of de - mining 16 million hectares of some of the most fertile land in France that is still polluted by the munitions left over after the first world war .
lives are lost every year in de - mining activities 75 years later .
think of what it must mean if that is the problem that France has .
what does it mean in Angola or Cambodia or Nicaragua where there are not nearly the resources or the capacity to make that kind of effort ?
we have an opportunity at the meetings that will take place in Ottawa next week to remind countries that a treaty is really the first step .
the next step is to make the treaty come to life , to give it meaning , to give it the tools and the resources needed to make it work .
the bill before members today is a way of ensuring that under the laws of Canada we are in a position to fully implement the treaty .
bill C - 22 does several important things .
first , it bans the production , use , storage and transfer of anti - personnel mines in Canada .
it requires the destruction of all anti - personnel mines , except for training purposes .
it outlines provisions for the verification measures that the convention provides to ensure compliance with the provisions of the convention .
bill C - 22 also criminalizes in Canadian law activities prohibited under the convention .
the legislation proposed was prepared in a short timeframe .
in reviewing it further we thought it important to address some charter concerns .
in this context , we will be introducing an amendment to subsection 11.2 which provides charter safeguards to persons who are requested to provide information to the government concerning the acquisition or possession of land mines .
in this respect , the bill addresses potential charter concerns where appropriate warrants must be secured if fact finding missions wish to gain access to private facilities or residences .
that way , once again we can use the protection of our courts as prescribed under our Criminal Code to ensure that there will be no abuse under the human rights provision .
the bill and the convention differ slightly in some respects .
the bill also includes provisions exempting properly de - activated mines that might used , for example , museum displays or kept as souvenirs .
at home the legislation gives us the legal basis for ensuring that Canada can remain mine free for all time .
we can set a real example by being the first to ratify .
this will speed the process of getting the other 39 countries that are needed to bring the convention into binding force .
the clock can start counting down today as we pass the bill which sets a measure and standard for all other countries to follow .
the process can begin here in this Chamber .
i do not use the words lightly , but I do think this is a defining moment for this country , for the House of Commons and for the Parliament of Canada that we can once again take a major step of leadership .
we have an opportunity to demonstrate our dedication to peace and to the elimination of suffering and to the welfare of children in mine affected countries .
i call on all members of the House to join me in supporting Bill C - 22 , as they have in the past , as all members of Parliament of all parties have given their co - operation , involvement and in many cases their passion and engagement .
it is interesting that the most effective and eloquent way of explaining the purpose and what we are doing comes not from long experienced parliamentarians , but oftentimes from the mouths of children .
in Toronto on Thursday I participated in a UNICEF event where a number of young children from Ancaster school had come together to launch a new videotape that is being sent to schools across Canada and , in fact , to schools in Cambodia to talk about the problems of land mines .
these young grade four students of their own volition undertook to write their own treaty .
i thought a fitting end to my opening speech would be just to recount to the members of the treaty what they had to say as they presented this treaty to me .
this is a bill of rights for children who live in countries where there are land mines .
these are the words they used :
children have the right to know what land mines look like , and to learn about them
children have the right to know where land mines are located
children have the right to be in a land mine free area
children have the right not to be teased when they are hurt by land mines
children have the right to have the best possible medical treatment at no cost to the family
children have the right to be supervised
children have the right to have fun and respect , even when they are hurt
children have the right to play and not get hurt
c . Children have the right to go to school , even if they are hurt
the children of Ancaster asked me to bring this children ' s treaty on land mines to the House of Commons to share it with my colleagues .
it demonstrates that this generation believes that Canada can make a difference .
i recommend Bill C - 22 to members of the House .
i ask members to make speedy passage possible and to say to the rest of the world that Canada will continue to take the lead to ensure that the world is land mine free for the children who wrote this treaty and who speak for children around the world .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I am proud to speak on behalf of the Reform Party in supporting Bill C - 22 .
bill C - 22 is an example of what this House can do in the future .
reform has supported this process from the word " go '' .
i hope this bill will be an example of what the government and the House can do in the future with respect to foreign policy as land mines are but a small part of the larger picture of conflict and conflict prevention in the late 20 th century .
i know that the minister and members of the Department of Foreign Affairs are interested in moving beyond this bill in developing foreign policy which deals not with the management of conflict but with the prevention of conflict .
we are approaching an era in foreign policy when Canada can use its moral suasive power to lead other like - minded nations in developing a more peaceful world .
these are not just words .
at that time Mozambique was one of the worst countries in the world .
it was a nation racked by civil war and it was heavily mined .
the hospital was 20 kilometres from the border .
tragically , some of them had their legs blown off .
my last experience was in 1992 when I went to visit my old boss in the hospital .
we rushed to the emergency department and then went directly to the operating room .
i remember this very vividly .
he had shrapnel injuries in his groin and lower abdomen .
he was very conscious of what was going on .
he was leaving Mozambique for South Africa for a better future for a safe future .
that young man is but an example of over 30,000 individuals from around the world who silently step on these devices and are blown to pieces .
some die but many actually survive and they go on to live a life of poverty , a life of insecurity and a life that is only a shadow of what it could have been .
to give an indication of what this young man ' s life will be like , the leg was blown off .
we took three hours to amputate his leg above the knee .
he will probably require other surgeries in the future because he will be faced with infection , further revisions of his amputation .
he was lucky that the injury did not go further up or that the anti - personnel mine was not larger .
many people have their legs blown off at the hip .
as the minister mentioned , some of these devices , if you can imagine , are actually designed like toys .
some are designed like butterflies .
the perverse logic behind these devices is not that they are meant to kill , because that would be too simple .
they are meant to maim .
they are meant to maim because the person who is maimed is a constant reminder in that society of what mines can do and what the opposition , their enemy , can do to them .
they are a constant economic drain to society .
they are a constant reminder , a constant example of fear that exists within the community to the people there .
they are not soldiers .
land mines are primarily designed to address and terrorize innocent civilians .
they are a weapon of terror .
they are not , generally speaking , a weapon used by military .
they were used to put around people ' s fields so that those individuals would have to pay money or allegiance to the opposing belligerents .
otherwise they would be blown up and they could not feed themselves .
mines also were used by guerrillas .
when areas such as dams were mined , guerrillas would go in , pick up the mines and use those mines to blow up the dam or the watering area .
they do not have an appropriate military use in the 1990 s , contrary to popular belief .
the international committee of the Red Cross demonstrated this very conclusively and we are indebted to the hard work it did to give us the information , to diffuse the comments that land mines were actually a useful tool in war in the late 20 th century .
they are not .
that was the primary argument that was used against this process , that mines are useful .
they are supposed to be used for military purposes .
they are not .
they are a weapon of terror , a weapon against the public , and that is why this bill is being put forward , to ban .
i would be remiss if I did not mention the very important contribution that was made by members of the public from Canada , members of the international community and especially Mines Action Canada who have done an outstanding job of pursuing and pushing this agenda for the last four years .
reform has been on it right from the beginning , because we put forward private members ' bills starting at the beginning of 1995 and when Mr. Ouellet came on board to support it , we were very happy , and when the Minister of Foreign Affairs came on board to support it and start the Ottawa process , we were also happy to support that initiative .
members from the Department of Foreign Affairs such Jill Sinclair , Bob Lawson , Ralph Lysyshyn have done an outstanding job in pushing this issue within the department and also internationally .
i might also say that their work in Oslo was something Canadians can be proud of .
the Americans tried to water this treaty down .
they tried to water it down so there were huge loopholes through it that would have made it not worth the paper it was written on .
instead , a charge was led by Canadian members of the Department of Foreign Affairs who were there who managed to mobilize support from other countries to ensure that the bill that was constructed in Oslo was going to be a bill we were proud of , a bill with teeth , a bill that would actually be effective for once in trying to ban these land mines .
that is something that we as Canadians can be very proud of .
i would like for a few minutes to illustrate the scope of the problem of land mines .
there are over 30,000 seeded all over the world .
they inflict damages in various countries that are absolutely horrendous .
in Angola 1 in 270 people is a mine victim and a similar number in Cambodia .
it goes beyond that .
land mines sit in the ground for over 50 years .
as the minister mentioned , France has land mines that are blowing up people today .
the most land mined country in the world is Egypt .
those land mines were seeded in the second world war and continue to blow up people every day .
land mines also continue to sit in the soil and cause huge economic devastation to countries that do not need this .
let us not forget that most of these land mines are seeded in countries among the poorest of the world .
the land mines sitting there for over 50 years prevent countries from economically getting on their feet .
it has become such a serious problem in countries such as Angola and Mozambique that innocent civilians are prepared to go into mined areas to plough their fields to feed themselves .
it now becomes a choice , chancing getting blown up or starving to death .
we should be ashamed that these devices were ever constructed and allowed to be tossed out in the manner which they have done for the last 80 plus years .
those costs are enormous .
in Croatia over thousands and thousands of hectares are mined , costing over a quarter of a billion dollars each year in lost productivity .
countries from Angola to Cambodia to Chechnya are so mined that they cannot get on their feet economically for decades .
the overall cost of demining is estimated at over $ 50 billion per year .
these devices cost as little as $ 7 to $ 30 to make , yet each mine costs between $ 300 and $ 1,000 to remove .
this cost will not be borne by the countries that are mined .
it will be borne by the international community .
we as nations do not have the money to do this .
there a few interesting things we can learn from this .
first , we were not prepared as a nation to settle for a treaty that was going to be merely one which was developed by consensus .
instead we did not settle for second best .
we settled for a situation that we knew the majority of the countries of the world would support .
therefore we have a treaty which has teeth for a change .
we also set a deadline .
the minister set a deadline a year ago that this December would be the month we would settle on a treaty .
it is something that we as Reformers can heartily support .
we are sick and tired of treaties taking decades to push forward when we know the majority of the international community will support them .
while we dither on many of these issues lives are lost , countries are laid to waste , economies are destroyed and in fact we domestically pay a penalty .
these tragic souls who would prefer to live in their own nations come to us looking for reprieve .
our defence budgets also incur great costs .
as a result we also put our soldiers in harm ' s way .
land mines have racked an enormous toll not only on people far away but on our own military .
peacekeepers fear land mines more than they fear the sniper ' s bullet .
if we look at the casualties that we have incurred of our peacekeepers the majority are as a result of land mines .
in fact , we have the tragic case of a peacekeeper whose parents live on the northern part of Vancouver Island .
their son was tragically blown up in the former Yugoslavia by a land mine .
they have worked very hard to bring this issue to the forefront .
this is a cost that we all bear .
further , when countries are trying to get back on their feet our aid and development budgets come into play in trying to demine and reconstruct societies and economies that have been laid to waste by war , and land mines contribute to this continual destruction within their economies .
the Ottawa process is important because it heralds a new co - operation between NGOs , non - governmental organizations , and government .
we must not let this process die .
for within this process lies hope to use and apply these lessons learned into other foreign policy initiatives in the future .
from 1945 to 1985 the international community has lurched from one conflict to another .
we have watched the precursors to conflict exist right in front of our eyes .
from Rwanda to the former Soviet Union , Cambodia , Burma , Central America wars have littered this globe and internecine conflicts have destroyed many economies and cost millions of lives .
we live in a world where rules are based on what was created after 1945 .
that world has changed .
between 1945 and 1985 the United Nations put forth six peacekeeping operations which cost roughly $ 3 billion .
between 1985 and now we have had over 26 peacekeeping operations .
the post - cold war era has set forth a new era , a new set of rules and a new set of challenges .
we have not met those challenges .
in fact , we have failed abysmally .
rather than trying to prevent conflict , we have tried to manage it with all the costs that are incurred in that .
we have watched in front of our eyes as nations have imploded , millions of people killed , economies destroyed and the seeds of ethnic hatred and discontent laid to bear and sewn for generations to come .
this is a penalty we will all pay .
it is high time that we started to recognize that conflict management is not acceptable in foreign policy any more .
we have to look ahead at preventing conflict and move our foreign policies from conflict management to conflict prevention .
this is where the Ottawa process can come into play .
the NGO community is usually the first group in the trenches witnessing the precursors to conflict and the rapid inappropriate militarization , the human rights abuses , the collapse of governmental and judicial structures .
all these things are witnessed by NGOs .
they often communicate their wishes to governmental structures but it hits the usual inertia that exists within government and within international governments in particular .
as a result of this inertia , as a result of this inaction , we have paid the price .
those who live far away have paid a far greater price .
we have to change this thinking .
it is important that we use the NGO community , use the conglomeration of NGOs part of this Ottawa process , as an early warning system that can identify countries that are ready to implode , identify the precursors to conflict and funnel this information directly to a central organization , an early warning system .
perhaps the most logical choice would be the UN crisis centre in New York .
for all that can be said about the United Nations with all of its inefficiencies , it is perhaps the only choice we have today .
even if the United Nations were to be removed or were to fall apart , we would have to create something to take its place .
therein lies another challenge which I might get to later on in my speech , the restructuring and revamping of the United Nations .
the UN crisis centre could take all the information that is presented to it as an early warning organization and feed it directly into the United Nations .
we must then have an existing group of responses by the international community to respond to these precursors .
such responses could be diplomatic initiatives , peace building initiatives and the introduction of positive information to dispel propaganda that is often used at the start of a conflict .
if we look at conflicts from Rwanda to the former Yugoslavia , one of the favoured tools that is used by a small number of individuals is to put forth negative propaganda to demonize another group .
as Michael Ignatieff said in one of his articles , often these groups are very similar but they exist on the narcissism of their differences .
they exist on demonizing the small differences that exist between different ethnic groups .
it can be broken .
once the precursors are identified , positive propaganda can be put in there .
in fact the United Nations already has the power to do that through shortwave radio and existing communications tools that it has .
it is exceedingly important that the UN get involved through diplomatic initiatives and positive propaganda .
furthermore a tool that is not being used often is the tool of economics .
many of these countries rely on international financial institutions in order to survive .
they also spend moneys given to them by the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and other IFIs on inappropriate militarization and to cause conflict .
wars need money .
you cannot run a war without money .
therefore , if this is occurring , choke off the money supply .
the IFIs can be used not only as a stick but also as a carrot .
as a stick we can withhold further loans , withhold their ability to renegotiate loans , moneys and grants and call back loans if necessary .
we can also use them to freeze the assets of rulers who are patently engaging in activities that are going to compromise their people .
we could freeze the assets of rulers such as the late Mobutu Sese Seko who was one of the richest men in the world .
there are the assets of Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya , when he engages in efforts to try to kill different ethnic groups within his country , when he tries to pit Kalenjin against Masai or Masai against Kikuyu .
these kinds of activities can be stopped by directly addressing the people responsible who are often a small cadre of individuals within a nation .
the IFIs could also be used as a carrot .
by lending money to provide peacemaking initiatives between different groups , by supporting peace building initiatives , by supporting activities that bring both of the groups together , by micro credit for minority groups so that they can get on their feet economically , by rewarding efforts to build structures of good governance and peace within a country , we can help to diffuse the precursors to war .
in the late 20 th century going into the 21 st century there exists a void in foreign policy .
the bipolar world created a world where two superpowers glared at each other at the end of a nuclear arsenal and under the absurd notion of mutual destruction .
the world has changed .
as that bipolar world collapsed , the shackles that held ethnic groups apart and kept ethnic hatreds simmering were removed and conflicts existed .
countries such as the United States and many members of the security council cannot be the nation states that will bring other countries together .
they are either perceived , rightly or wrongly , as having imperialistic tendencies or they have their own colonial baggage .
the world is looking for a new group of individuals to bring nation states together .
i believe that responsibility will fall on the middle powers such as Austria , Australia , Costa Rica , New Zealand , Norway and Canada .
many of these nations are working in isolation on peace building initiatives .
it is more efficient for these nations to work together in a multilateral fashion but no one is assuming the leadership role that would bring these countries together .
canada can be that country .
we have proven through the land mines issue that we have the moral suasive power to do this .
we have proven through our Nobel peace prize for our peacekeeping efforts that we can develop international consensus for peace building .
we have the diplomatic skills .
we have the personnel in the Department of Foreign Affairs and we have an international reputation that is virtually unrivalled .
we also have the security aspect and are involved with people from the Pacific Rim to Europe and to points south .
we are in an enviable position to do that .
as we end the 20 th century and enter the 21 st century , I can only ask the minister to work with his colleagues in countries such as those I have mentioned .
he could ask them to come to Canada to attend a small summit , a summit of the middle powers .
he could bring these countries together , put the cards on the table and determine what everyone is working on in peace building .
i was in Norway at the Oslo treaty signing on land mines .
i spoke to members of other countries , such as the Norwegians .
i was interested to learn about their work .
i found it remarkable that their work is very similar to our work .
it is unfortunate that we are working in isolation .
our power to move international foreign policy forward can come about more expeditiously if we work together .
there will be a lot of co - operation and like - mindedness if we pursue that .
i ask the foreign minister , the government and other members in this House to come together to pursue this course .
only if we do this can we get the required changes to stop the international bureaucratic inertia in international foreign policy .
we could then address the security issues that affect us all .
by security challenges and issues I refer not only to military security challenges but also to environmental security issues .
environmental issues range from our problems at the north pole to nuclear issues and to issues of the environment .
all will require international co - operation .
the Ottawa process did not start with 100 countries all wanting to ban land mines .
it started with a handful of countries , with the leadership of the NGO community and with the leadership of Canada and a few other nations .
we can apply that same principle to pursue larger security issues and larger security challenges in the future .
i hope that we as a nation and as a Parliament can look forward to a future of addressing these larger security challenges .
if we continue to lurch from conflict to conflict and do not try to prevent conflict , then we will be set with an unsustainable situation in the near future .
we can no longer afford to see the implosion of nation states across this globe .
we can no longer afford to see the proliferation of this destruction .
if we want to speak pragmatically and domestically , these issues that occur half a world away will sooner or later come to roost in our own backyard .
it is imperative that we deal with it now .
it has often been said in the medical profession that prevention is worth much more than dealing with the person ' s medical problem after the fact .
i hope we can apply that principle to foreign policy .
when I spoke to Jody Williams , the Nobel peace prize winner about this , she said that those were nice words .
i did not remind her that when we were pursuing the course of banning land mines four years ago , people said that it was a utopian dream and that those were nice words .
well these are more than nice words .
there are pragmatic solutions .
if we do not seek to dream and look to the future , to building a new stronger , better world by using our expertise , by using pragmatic tools and solutions , by using the leadership that we as a nation can put forward , then we have nothing .
we can and must use our moral suasive power , use the tools that are at our fingertips to build a better , more peaceful world for all people .
i will close by saying once again that this is an issue of which all Canadians can be proud .
reform is very proud to be part of the process because we have been pursuing peacekeeping initiatives for many , many years and we will continue to do so .
we look forward to working with the government in pursuing pragmatic , effective peacekeeping and peacemaking solutions in the future .
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
madam Speaker , when Alfred Nobel , the inventor of dynamite , decided to establish the prizes that would make his name a household word , he said that the main dividends of his invention should be used to promote peace in the world .
in 1997 , the dividends went to the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines and its co - ordinator , Jody Williams , in recognition of more than six years of intense efforts by more than a thousand non - governmental organizations in over 60 countries .
thanks to this campaign , described by the former Secretary General of the United Nations , Boutros Boutros - Ghali , as the most important and effective exercise in civilian society since World War II , several countries banned the export of anti - personnel mines , destroyed or began to destroy their stocks of mines , banned or halted their use , or announced that they were ceasing production of them .
these efforts by civilian society , which thus forced all governments the world over to react to the scourge of anti - personnel mines , would probably never have resulted in the convention to ban these mines , but for the initiative and determination of Canada ' s current Minister of Foreign Affairs .
by bringing together representatives of governments , international organizations and NGOs in the federal capital in October 1996 , and by initiating the Ottawa process , the minister assumed a leadership role that will culminate in the signing , on December 3 and 4 , of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use , Stockpiling , Production and Transfer of Anti - Personnel Mines and on their Destruction .
the Ottawa process was marked not only by unprecedented co - operation on the part of government and non - government actors in the international community , but particularly by its speed of execution .
bill C - 22 seeks to implement this convention , and the House is being asked to give speedy approval to it today , both at second and third readings .
i am pleased to say that the Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C - 22 , subject to a number of amendments being considered , so as to improve this implementing legislation .
support for the bill is first and foremost support for a convention to work together to maintain international peace and security , as stated in the preamble to the UN charter , to which Canada is a signatory , and which a sovereign Quebec will fully support when it joins the other nations of the world .
it is an instrument which primarily seeks to eliminate deadly weapons , namely anti - personnel mines , by prohibiting their use , stockpiling , production , conservation and transfer .
hopefully , the general obligations assumed by the states will put an end to the use of anti - personnel mines , which is still a serious problem , given that for every mine removed , 20 new ones are installed .
this convention will contribute to the destruction of the 110 million mines distributed throughout more than 70 countries in the world , which mutilate in excess of 25,000 people yearly , 80 % of them civilians .
anti - personnel mines claim 70 new victims every day , or one person every 20 minutes .
during the time I am speaking here today , one more person will be killed , or if lucky only maimed by this little instrument of death .
this victim is likely to be a child , probably a child in Afghanistan , Cambodia or Somalia , since many of the deaths and injuries caused by land mines in those countries involve children .
this convention will also encourage the destruction of anti - personnel mines in mined areas and will oblige signatory states to ensure that mines are destroyed within ten years of the effective date of the convention , at the very latest .
farm lands remain unworked and large grazing areas unused , and will remain so as long as the land remains riddled with anti - personnel mines and burden these countries with deaths and injuries , and the costs related to victim assistance .
in this connection , the convention rightly promises international co - operation and assistance , without which the objectives of the convention cannot be met .
the convention gives each state party the right to seek and to obtain assistance from other signatory states , if possible and insofar as possible .
the state parties that are in a position to do so commit , moreover , to provide assistance for the care of mine victims , as well as assistance in mine removal .
in article 9 of the convention , the state parties also commit to " all appropriate legal , administrative and other measures , including the imposition of penal sanctions , to prevent and suppress any activity prohibited to a State Party under this Convention undertaken by persons or on territory under its jurisdiction or control '' .
bill C - 22 seems to be the primary legislative means of assuming this obligation , and seeks to give legal effect in Canada to the Convention as a whole .
i have examined the text of Bill C - 22 closely and it seems to me to contain the necessary provisions for performance in good faith of the anti - personnel mines convention , as required by the pacta sunt servanda rule set out in article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties .
there are , however , certain amendments that could improve this implementing legislation and I will have an opportunity shortly , in committee at report stage , to present and explain the amendments the Bloc Quebecois would like to see made to Bill C - 22 .
as with other foreign affairs issues , the Bloc Quebecois is motivated by the values and convictions common to the government party and to other parties in the House .
in this instance , the values of international peace and security are involved , as are the values associated with promoting and protecting rights and freedoms , particularly the most basic right , the right to life .
that is why the Bloc Quebecois is prepared to support Bill C - 22 and the convention it is intended to implement , as they are both the reflection of such values .
in a few moments , the Bloc Quebecois will submit to the House suggested amendments to improve the bill and to make more democratic the process by which possible amendments to it would be passed in future .
the passage of Bill C - 22 by the House of Commons , its subsequent approval by the Senate , and assent will enable the Government of Canada to complete phase 1 of the Ottawa process .
other measures will have to be implemented , and the Bloc Quebecois will continue to support those that will help attain the convention ' s objectives .
in another moment of insight , and wisdom it should be added , the Swede Alfred Nobel said , and I quote :
[ English ] < `` My factories may make an end of war sooner than your congresses .
the day when two army corps can annihilate each other in one second , all civilized nations , it is to be hoped , will recoil from war and discharge their troops '' .
parliaments the world over must go on repeating the wishes expressed by Alfred Nobel .
they must join forces with civilian society and international organizations in promoting peace and protecting humankind from the scourge of war so that humanity can triumph .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
madam Speaker , I am pleased to participate in this historic debate today on behalf of the New Democratic Party and my colleagues in the federal NDP caucus .
i want to extend congratulations to the minister on what I am sure must be one of the happier days of his ministry at foreign affairs .
from having worked with the minister before when we were both lowly opposition foreign affairs critics , I know his time in office is not always replete with the ability to do some of the things he called for .
i know today must be a special day for him , being able to live up to the expectations that he has and that we share with him for Canada as a country that shows leadership in the building of an international regime which leads toward the prevention of war and the elimination of the kind of violence that land mines stand for .
it was interesting listening to the hon. member from Vancouver Island .
one got a sense of the revulsion that in this case medical personnel who have worked with the consequences of land mines bring to this debate .
i also had an image of an earlier revulsion that people had coming out of the first world war with respect to the effect of chemical weapons and the effort that was made after that to ensure they would not be used again as a matter of course in the exercise of war .
it is too bad I suppose that we did not learn the lesson about land mines 80 years ago .
we see that land mines are in some ways a symbol of what has happened in the 20 th century .
civilians as much or more in many respects than military personnel have come to be the objects of military technology .
the point I want to emphasize in today ' s debate is I hope that today might be the beginning by example of what I regard to be an equally and perhaps ultimately in the planetary sense a more important effort and that is to ban another kind of weapon which has as its primary target civilians and not military personnel .
of course what I am speaking about are nuclear weapons .
there are a lot of people of course around the world who are working on this but they are a minority .
they need to become a majority in government circles and in international circles .
the example we need to take from this is not just the successful way in which governments , in particular in this case the Canadian government , led the way , but governments , international agencies , NGOs , interested individuals , political parties and non - partisan co - operation .
we also need to take the example that this was done by Canada without insisting on what we sometimes , it seems to me too often , insist on and that is that we have to have the United States on board before something can be signed , before there can be a consensus .
obviously when it comes to nuclear weapons , if we do not have the people with nuclear weapons on board , we do not have much of a treaty or an accomplishment .
we should take this action on mines as an example of what we can do when we are prepared to act without the consent or approval of the United States or for that matter other major powers .
we do not feel we are doing anything less important today because the United States has not agreed .
if the United States had agreed and if Russia and other larger countries had joined , in a practical sense we would feel much more was being accomplished .
that does not take away from what is being accomplished at the lesser practical level but also at the moral and political levels .
as the minister I am sure hopes and as all of us here hope , it may be that the other countries which have not yet done so will some day sign on to this treaty .
a couple of years ago I participated in one of the earlier round table discussions on this topic .
it was held at the National Conference Centre .
it was stressed that we should do whatever we could to successfully abolish anti - personnel mines .
at that time we were still dreaming of what is now unfolding .
i will repeat the point I made that day .
i said that this would become a prototype for what we could do with respect to other problems which needed to be addressed , in particular that of nuclear weapons .
we need to abolish them while we have this window of opportunity after the cold war and before another situation occurs between the nuclear powers which would make the abolition of nuclear weapons very remote once again .
the NDP has been supportive of the initiative from the beginning .
we extend our congratulations to the NGOs that have been involved and organizations such as Mines Action Canada , the Red Cross , UNICEF and all others that laid the groundwork for public support for a ban on land mines .
a very important thing is happening out there which the minister has acknowledged .
a tremendous critical mass that developed at the political , the NGO , the bureaucratic and the parliamentary levels has made this kind of thing possible and has given it the kind of momentum that made it irresistible to many other countries .
at a certain point people want to become part of a good thing that is happening .
we need to make other good things happen that people will want to become part of .
we also want to commemorate the tremendous role Princess Diana played in raising awareness of the daunting task of banning land mines .
we also want to extend our congratulations to Jodie Williams , the American activist who spearheaded the international campaign to ban land mines , and all the NGOs involved in that campaign around the world .
this is an example of how Canadian diplomacy can succeed if effort and energy are focused on items other than trade promotion .
i say almost exclusive because obviously it was not exclusive .
there were other things going on like this .
the federal government has to be very careful to back up the treaty with the financial support it will need .
when it does so we want to make clear that it will have the support of members from this corner of the House .
it will not be cheap in a worldwide sense or in any sense to support the kind of de - mining that needs to go on and to rehabilitate victims .
we urge the minister to find the resources necessary .
we hope that will be one way in which the government can make an ongoing commitment to the values and the policies to which we are committing ourselves today in this debate .
this is a good day for parliament and a good day for Canada .
i hope 20 years from now we will be able to look back on this day , look back on the Ottawa process and say this became a model , a prototype , a paradigm for how we deal with other pressing disarmament issues .
in particular I hope we will look back on it and say it became a model for eventually bringing the world to the point where we were able to abolish , not just land mines and small gun trade but nuclear weapons and the threat to creation and to the human prospect that continued existence of these weapons poses for all humankind .
hon. Sheila Finestone ( Mount Royal , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I have listened to the debate today in the House .
i had the distinct privilege to go with the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
his manner is profoundly founded in a belief of the importance of ridding the world of land mines .
it is not only a matter of de - mining but also a matter of education and sensitization .
first and foremost it is a matter of having the world agree that unacceptable mines which destroy the lives and the limbs of young children and others in society do not reflect the best interests of anybody .
i listened to what my hon. colleague had to say .
what role does he think each and every one of us could play internationally as well as nationally ?
in our ridings we have a right and responsibility to indicate to people how devilish these instruments are as we do to colleagues we have had the privilege of meeting around the world through the international associations with which we are affiliated .
we should encourage our members to be in touch with members in other countries to enable legislation , this treaty or this declaration , to be put forward in a way that would be expeditious and constructive and to ensure the financing is behind it in each of country of the world , even countries which at the moment are not prepared to sign but have the means to rehabilitate , educate and train those who have been affected and those who could be affected .
how would the hon. member look at that issue ?
Mr. Bill Blaikie :
madam Speaker , I thank the hon. member for her question .
we all have a responsibility to use every opportunity that presents itself and not to be afraid to be intense about it when we are in contact with members of Parliament , legislators and political people from all parts of the world .
we have plenty of those opportunities as individual members of Parliament in the various parliamentary associations we belong to and the various international fora we participate in as members of a Canadian delegation .
at these meetings and in life generally there is a tendency for people to back off when somebody is intense about something , trying to be persuasive and trying to make the case that this is something we should do .
it is sort of not cool to be like that .
we put certain things on the record .
they are there and we can always say that we said them .
we need to go beyond that whenever we have the chance to buttonhole people over dinner , in the corridors or through concerted pressure to make sure these items are on the agenda , that they are discussed and that decisions are taken .
people should be put on the spot and made to think about it .
these are the kinds of things Canadians can do in various international gatherings .
in the past we have attended many gatherings where we have met all kinds of people .
in this case we could be corresponding with legislators in countries that have not signed on and trying to make the case that their countries should sign on , or at least put a little pressure on them to put a little pressure on their executive to get with it and follow the Canadian example .
hon. Sheila Finestone :
madam Speaker , I have a supplementary question for the hon. member .
i am pleased he mentioned emotion .
exhibits are being planned for either the railway room or the reading room .
i hope the member will invite people he knows to come here .
he should even welcome to Canada those parliamentarians he does not know .
he should be a host in the name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs .
the exhibits will make us heartsick .
we will see dreadful little mines in the form toys that attract children so that they will pick them up to have them explode in their hands .
we saw children with lost hands , lost legs and damaged limbs .
it is very easy to speak with the emotion the member referred to .
i am happy he raised it .
we have a truly international cause .
i thank the member for that observation .
would he care to respond about the Reform Party in particular ?
Mr. Bill Blaikie :
madam Speaker , I do not care to respond because I do not want to spoil what I think is a co - operative non - partisan effort going on here today .
there will be other opportunities to reflect on the differences that exist between the parties with respect to participation in some parliamentary associations and not others .
i just want to say that when we think about the mines that are constructed to appear to be toys so that children will pick them up , it makes us kind of ashamed to be human beings when we think that these weapons were devised by the human mind and constructed by human hands .
it is hard to conceive of a world in which this would be possible but this is the world we are confronted with and against which we set ourselves today as a country alongside so many other countries .
from a theological and biblical point of view , it reminds us of what a sinful world we live in .
however , we look to the words of Isaiah .
we want to finally beat swords into ploughshares and spears into pruning hooks .
by finally getting rid of land mines in many countries , as the member from the Reform Party said , we actually want to create a world that is safe for ploughshares .
so many people cannot plough and grow food and cannot economically develop because of land mines .
it is a case of creating a world in which ploughshares can be employed without danger to life and limb .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i just want to mention that the member for Mount Royal is deliberately misleading this House when she mentions -
an hon. member :
a point of order .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
the whip .
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I do not think that is a point of order .
it is possibly a matter of debate but I certainly do not think we should take the House down this path on a day where such an issue is being debated .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
would the hon. member care to rephrase his comments ?
Mr. Keith Martin :
i did not want to bring this up during this debate but I will have her know that it was the Reform Party that in this House in 1994 started the process on land mines by presenting a private member ' s bill in this House calling for a ban on land mines .
it was the government that refused -
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
i am afraid you are going into debate right now .
we will resume debate with the hon. member for Kings - Hants .
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
madam Speaker , Canadians should feel a great deal of pride in this significant accomplishment today .
canada has regained for a brief moment its traditional role as a middle power and has relinked human rights and foreign policy which many Canadians have been concerned about since 1993 .
the Minister of Foreign Affairs has demonstrated leadership in championing the ban on anti - personnel mines and it has paid off .
on behalf of my party , I congratulate the minister on this accomplishment .
i would also like to take the time to congratulate Jody Williams as well as all the NGOs and individuals , including Princess Diana , who provided an international focus and a popular focus on this very important issue at a time when it needed that critical mass of support internationally .
most of these people are not even soldiers trying to clear land mines .
the people that are most vulnerable to these land mines are civilians .
two weeks ago I travelled to Bosnia as part of a delegation of MPs from the Defence and Foreign Affairs committees .
in Bosnia I witnessed first hand the devastation and suffering caused by land mines .
Canadian peacekeepers provide mine awareness programs in elementary schools .
i was surprised and , in fact , disturbed by the level of familiarity that children already have with land mines .
children have nicknames for land mines .
some are called Skoal mines because they are shaped like a tobacco can .
some mines similarly are called camera mines because they resemble a camera .
some are called pineapple mines because of the fact that they resemble pineapples .
it seems to me that the innocence of childhood cannot coexist with an intimate knowledge of and familiarity with land mines .
in Bosnia , mines are being redeployed around houses to prevent the return of refugees and displaced people to their homes .
mines are being redeployed around farmers ' fields to prevent theft .
in some cases , farmers ' fields have been rendered useless by land mines .
SFOR ' s mandate does not include clearing farmers ' fields .
in order for their fields to be cleared by SFOR , some farmers have become resourceful and are actually placing mines or relocating mines to the sides of roads near their fields to try to draw attention to and create a sense of priority with regard to the clearing of land mines from their own fields .
six million mines were deployed in Bosnia during the war and to date the UN estimates there are still 3 million mines left in Bosnia .
the problem for the peacekeepers is that millions of mines are unaccounted for across the country .
several weeks ago a tractor trailer overturned near Banka Luka and the trailer rolled over a land mine , causing an explosion .
as Canadians , it is sometimes difficult to imagine the constant fear of living in an area that is plagued by the scourge of land mines .
for me on a personal level , in Canada something I enjoy doing every morning is my morning run .
we were warned when we were in Bosnia in the Velika Kladusa area , as well as in other areas , not to run in the mornings .
you cannot go off the pavement .
if you go off the pavement on to the shoulder of the road , you may hit a land mine .
as a child I was able to run through and play in fields with no risk and no fear of being maimed or killed by a land mine .
farmers , mothers , fathers , children , innocent people , these are the people paying for these wars that were fought and , to a considerable extent , are now over .
land mines do not require sophisticated technology to manufacture and this is part of the problem .
sometimes the least stable states are producing land mines now and people are producing land mines in their basements because of the availability of the resources and the tools necessary to make land mines .
it is a difficult problem to control and to contain .
as with any major humanitarian effort , this ban will require a great deal of expertise and resources .
the Minister of Foreign Affairs earlier referred to the need for investments in sophisticated technology and equipment in the removal of land mines .
this is critical as well .
it will take a long time before all the land mines are cleared from countries like Cambodia , Bosnia , Rwanda , Angola , Afghanistan , Egypt , just to name a few .
Canadians have a very important role to play in this effort .
our peacekeepers are among the best in the world .
that is something I would like to mention .
upon returning from Bosnia , I came back with a tremendous pride in our peacekeepers and also the recognition that one of the things that is unique to Canadians is our peacekeeping prowess , which is internationally recognized .
i would also remind my colleagues from the Bloc that one of the first casualties of a divided Canada would be our ability to participate fully and meaningfully in international peacekeeping and in other types of international fora .
not only do Canadians need a strong united Canada but the world needs a strong united Canada .
we have contributed over $ 11 million to the humanitarian efforts to clear land mines .
as the minister mentioned , we must continue to invest in technology and perhaps create opportunities for Canadian companies like Bombardier which may have the ability to develop new technologies for this very important task at hand .
it can take 10 peacekeepers up to a full day to manually clear a minefield the size of a gymnasium .
mine removal requires significant and sustained resources that are very costly .
over the past few years two million to five million more land mines have been deployed .
this number , combined with the number already in the ground means that at current de - mining rates it could take decades to rid the world of the current mines in the ground .
during that time span , thousands more will be injured or killed , even with the signing of this agreement .
that is why after this week we cannot forget the need for continued vigilance in ensuring that the necessary resources are provided to ensure that the task that is beginning with the signing of this land mine treaty will continue over the next several years as part of our international participation in this effort .
Conditionality must be used and can be used with IMF funding to ensure the full co - operation of resources of countries that seek IMF funding .
by passing this bill Canadians will be demonstrating to other countries the need to quickly and decisively act in ratifying the treaty .
i have a further note on my trip to Bosnia .
in one of our briefings we were alerted to the fact that an anti - tank mine can be converted into an anti - personnel mine .
this can be done with a band saw in some cases .
we must be vigilant in ensuring that the TMA - 3 anti - tank mine cannot slip through a loophole in this bill .
Canadian companies could conceivably still manufacture a TMA - 3 model anti - tank mine and sell it to another country with the proper export permit .
within the other country that mine could be turned into three anti - personnel mines .
nothing can stop the buyer from the other country from altering the mine if that country is not a signatory to this treaty .
once the mine leaves Canada , the responsibility is out of our hands .
therefore , during this debate I am seeking clarification from the government on how the definition will be applied to avoid that type of situation .
it is a great accomplishment to have 100 countries sign the treaty .
however , the major countries that have not signed , with the exception of the U.S. , are the countries where the greatest military uncertainty lies .
we must continue to use every lever we have as a middle power through international fora to ensure these other countries do sign .
i leave the House with the words of the former secretary general of the UN , Boutros Boutros - Ghali : " No nation alone can prevent the killing fields full of land mines .
no nation alone can prevent inhumane weapons from being deployed , but all nations united with a single purpose can make this world more secure for generations to come '' .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
madam Speaker , I congratulate my friend from Kings - Hants for a wonderful and eloquent speech on this important day and on this important issue .
once again he has demonstrated his commitment to foreign policy which he has done since he came to this Parliament , and he continues to do so in a very eloquent manner .
by their actions they have saved many lives and are continuing to further the important issue of how we get these hundreds of millions of land mines out of the ground .
i hope the hon. member will work with these groups and give them the help they require for the betterment of Canadians and for the betterment of people abroad .
we have not and are not interested in pursuing any course that will take us abroad where we will deal with international trips that are going to be a waste of taxpayer money , a waste of our time .
we will only go on these trips where there is a demonstrable need and where we are going to gain and have some effective input into these trips .
i would like to again congratulate the member for Kings - Hants and ask if he can tell us if he has any ideas on any opportunities that he can present to this House or any ideas that he has on how Canada can continue to engage in the important process of demining .
Mr. Scott Brison :
there are organizations in the maritimes and some individuals in my riding who have been adamant and constant in their support of this type of initiative .
i guess it is part of being a maritimer , humble and self - deprecating individuals , that we do not like to toot our horn too much .
we appreciate it when we do get this type of support from the west .
we are proud of all Canadians who have been participating in this effort .
it is a gain .
i do consider this a national unity issue because I think , frankly , if we do more to inform Canadians of the importance of this leadership and do more to inform Canadians of the prowess of our peacekeepers internationally , we give Canadians more reasons to be proud and more reasons to maintain a strong and united Canada .
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) :
madam Speaker , I am very happy to speak today on the bill to ban land mines .
it is not often that I find a reason to congratulate the government , especially in the area of foreign affairs , but today I salute the minister ' s efforts .
this will be most widely felt in countries such as Cambodia and Angola and Mozambique , where it is civilians earning a living in the fields and children playing who suffer as a result of land mines .
my colleague from Kings - Hants recently travelled to Bosnia where he met farmers who could not plough their fields because they were fearful that they would blow themselves up with land mines .
others use mines to protect their crops .
this treaty addresses this problem , and I am sure that all members in this House and all Canadians are proud that this initiative was led by Canada .
so again , I offer my warmest congratulations to the government .
i do have some concerns , however , and my concerns are both domestic and international in nature .
it seems to me that there are companies in Canada that manufacture devices that could be found in land mines .
i am told that these mines do not require complicated technology to work .
there are a lot of pieces required , however .
my concern is the following :
what will happen in the years and months ahead , when it is discovered that the triggering device or a spring or any part of a land mine being used somewhere else was in fact manufactured in Canada ?
we have in this country many major electronics companies that manufacture all sorts of little odds and ends that make up components in computer , radios , televisions and telephones .
it would prove most embarrassing if it turned out that a product from a major Canadian form was inadvertently used as a trigger in a land mine .
are there any measures to prevent this from happening ?
my concerns that deal with international affairs are perhaps not as traightforward .
what I am about to say is very important and cannot be orverlooked .
while the land mines this treaty seeks to ban will harm people , the land mines laid by our friends and allies , the Americans , are there to protect people .
i cannot emphasize this enough , so I will say it again :
this treaty is useful in that it is an effort to rid the world of land mines form wars gone by .
when a conflict is over and soldiers have returned home , there has to be an opportunity to return to normalisation .
part of this process means that fields should be deared of mines so innocent men , women and children can work and play , build and prosper , without fear .
this is not the situation on the 38 th parallel , the border between South Korea and North Korea .
the situation is much different .
this is not a case of war gone by .
this is a clear case of a conflict that still exists .
the 37,000 U.S. troops are there to protect our Pacific ally from invasion .
the zone where American land mines have been laid is a zone of conflict .
it is monitored by the South Koreans as well as by the Americans .
we must not forget that , on November 11 , Canadians stop to pay Tribute to our veterans who served in World War I and World War II and also our veterans who fought for the freedom of South Korea during the Korean War .
that freedom is still in jeopardy because of the military threat of North Korea .
this is not an area where farmers would otherwise be tilling the soil .
the United States is Canada ' s close friend and ally .
it has not signed this treaty .
the American government studied the matter and concluded that to do so would jeopardize its position in Korea and thus jeapardize the lives of its 37,000 soldiers and the lives of South Koreans and the freedoms that exist there and that have been fought for .
on Friday , it was announced that in December North Korea will enter into peace talks with South Korea , that will include China and the United States .
we will wait and see , hoping that real progress is made .
there are other things that should be widely known about the American effort as we approach the day when this treaty is signed .
the United States is trying to find a replacement for the anti - personnel land mines currently being used in the Korean peninsula .
i encourage the government to continue to put pressure on these countries .
in fact , two countries where land mines have been most harmful to civilians in recent years are Afghanistan and Cambodia .
these mines are left over from the Communist regime .
i have been told that there are mines left over from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan that were made deliberately to look like toys .
it was a deliberate attempt to kill children and to terrorize the Afghans into submission .
my other concern that involves international consideration is APEC , the Asia Pacific Economic Co - operation meeting that is taking place in Vancouver as we speak .
i understand that the APEC meeting wil not address human rights concerns , but only economic issues .
that is not right , and I know that many Canadians feel the same way .
if the governement is really serious about ridding the world of land mines , the APEC summit would be a timely opportunity to challenge countries to join .
also , I want to congratulate the government , and in particular , the Minister of Foreign Affairs for his efforts .
i sincerely hope that the government will take my comments seriously , and take them into consideration .
the Speaker :
my dear colleague , we still have time for comments and questions , but as it is nearly 2 o ' clock , you will have the floor again following Oral Question Period .
right now , however , we will proceed with Statements by Members beginning with the hon. member for Egmont .
statements BY MEMBERS
LORIE KANE
Mr. Joe McGuire ( Egmont , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , a great moment in Canadian sport occurred this past weekend when Lorie Kane , a native of Prince Edward Island , tied for first place in regulation play in the LPGA tour championship .
the top 30 women golfers of the world came together in Las Vegas for the final tournament of the year to determine who was the best .
to have a Canadian and a Prince Edward Islander tie for first place was a great achievement for Lorie and for Canadian women ' s golf .
the fact that Lorie lost after three playoff holes to the top money winner and player of the year , Annika Sorenstam , does not diminish the pride all islanders feel in her performance .
rightly or wrongly , a golfer ' s success is measured by money earned .
by this standard Lorie ' s earnings of over $ 425,000 U.S. have established her as the best female Canadian golfer in history .
to accomplish this as a rookie on the tour makes it all the more impressive .
Lorie is a great ambassador for the sport , for P.E.I. and for Canada .
she always remembers those who have helped her along the road .
Lorie , we congratulate you and wish you continued success .

CATRIONA LEMAY DOAN
Mr. Rob Anders ( Calgary West , Ref. ) :
on Saturday , Ms. LeMay Doan became the first woman to shatter two speed skating world records within an hour of one another in the 500 metre and 1,000 metre races .
Ms. LeMay Doan is the best female speed skating sprinter in the world and she represents Canada .
on behalf of the residents of Calgary West who hosted the World Cup Sprints at the Olympic Oval , I ask all parliamentary representatives to stand now and honour this remarkable achievement .

Mr. Guy Saint - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , laid low by a heart attack a week ago , Senator Marcel Prud ' homme is now recovering in Montreal ' s H 么 tel - Dieu hospital .
a colourful and loquacious politician , he had a successful parliamentary career in Ottawa from 1964 to 1993 as the Liberal member for Saint - Denis in Montreal .

aboriginal PEOPLES
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint - Jean , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , one year after the tabling of the report by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples , I rise to criticize the government ' s failure to act on its main recommendations .
they include self - government , and negotiations on this point are still dragging on .
this issue , however , is a fundamental right , which will allow Native peoples to free themselves from financial dependence on Ottawa .
the commission raised many social problems , which require the government ' s immediate and effective attention .
the levels of drug and alcohol abuse and of suicide among Aboriginal people are the highest in Canada , and they are among the most poorly housed Canadians .
in Quebec , on the other hand , the statistics are much more positive .

diabetes AWARENESS MONTH
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , November is Diabetes Awareness Month .
nearly 1.5 million Canadians have diabetes which is a major cause of premature death and other significant health problems .
the chances of having diabetes increase with age .
it affects more than 11 % of Canadians between 65 and 74 .
diabetes rates for aboriginals are three times that of the general population .
that is why in the Speech from the Throne this government identified the need to develop new initiatives to address the rapid increase of diabetes in aboriginal communities .
health Canada plays an important role in the fight against diabetes by supporting research through the Medical Research Council , by facilitating the operation of the multisectoral Diabetes Council of Canada and by working with First Nations communities to develop effective diabetes programming .
Mr. Speaker , please join me in wishing the Canadian Diabetes Association and its many volunteers a very successful Diabetes Awareness Month .

land MINES
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , today marks a historic day for Canada when we will pass in this House a law which will ban the use , production and sale of anti - personnel mines .
by doing this , Canada will be one of the first nations in the world to actually have a law banning these heinous devices that claim over 30,000 lives a year and lays to waste economies of some of the poorest nations of the world .
canada , along with NGOs , has led the charge to ban these devices .
mines Action Canada , foreign affairs personnel and members of Parliament have stood together to pursue this .
this is an example of what Canada can do on the international stage .
now we must move beyond land mines and use this Ottawa process to address the larger security issues that affect us all .
we must move from a reactive foreign policy to a proactive one .
the 21 st century needs a leader to pursue these objectives and Canada can be this leader .
the 21 st century belongs to Canada .
we must seize the day and move forward .

olympic INTERNATIONAL CHILDREN ' S FESTIVAL
Ms. Beth Phinney ( Hamilton Mountain , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wish to inform the House of a remarkable event that will be held in Hamilton .
the executive members of the International Children ' s Games have unanimously supported that the city of Hamilton host the first Olympic International Children ' s Festival July 1 , Canada Day , through July 8 in the year 2000 .
the plan calls for a program of 13 sports as well as a cultural festival and celebration of the Olympics being held that year in Australia .
as host , Hamilton ' s organizing committee ' s goal is to involve 100 cities and approximately 5,000 athletes from across Canada and the world in a celebration of sport and culture in the new millennium .
the festival ' s theme " The Spirit Unites " represents the aspirations of youth across the globe to come together and embrace the Olympic spirit .
what a great way for Canadian youth to celebrate unity with each other and with youth from around the world .
the city of Hamilton hopes to count on the support of the Government of Canada as it prepares to host what will be one of the premier millennium events in Canada .

the LATE JUSTICE JOHN SOPINKA
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Ahuntsic , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we all learned with great regret this morning of the sudden passing of Supreme Court Justice John Sopinka after a short illness .
Mr. Justice Sopinka was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada in June 1988 .
he was born in 1933 in Broderick , Saskatchewan . He was educated in Hamilton , Ontario , and graduated from the University of Toronto in 1958 .
prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court , he was one of Canada ' s most renowned lawyers and had been called to the bar in five provinces and two territories .
on behalf of all members of this House I wish to extend my deepest sympathies to the members of his family .

JOURN 脡 E NATIONALE DES PATRIOTES
Mr. St 茅 phane Bergeron ( Verch 猫 res , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Journ 茅 e nationale des Patriotes was celebrated yesterday in Saint - Denis - sur - Richelieu .
on October 30 , 1995 , nearly 94 % of Quebeckers made their wishes known democratically on their collective future .
however , for our precious democratic heritage that allows us to hold this basic exercise of consultation in an atmosphere of calm , civility and mutual respect , we must thank the patriots of a century ago .
we must put to good use their gift to us and the sacrifices they made so that today we might enjoy the individual and political freedoms so dear to us and the democratic and responsible institutions of which we are so proud .

BRITISH COLUMBIA
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , since 1993 the Liberals have failed to address B.C. ' s concerns .
the Liberals have their own agenda for APEC .
it is a failed attempt to heal the wounds .
real job creators for B.C. , fish , wood and environmental products , have not made APEC ' s to do list .
the Liberals have failed to negotiate a Pacific salmon treaty with the U.S. It has turned off Pacific lighthouses .
it has even closed CFB Chilliwack and left B.C. without emergency preparedness .
the Liberals have cut out the voice of British Columbians by excluding 25 BC MPs from participation at APEC .
the Liberals would have preferred to have hosted APEC in Toronto or Montreal .
the Liberals are fanning the fires of B.C. alienation with $ 65 million .
they are not creating jobs for B.C. British Columbians are too smart to be fooled by Liberals .

anti - SEALING LOBBY GROUPS
Mr. John McKay ( Scarborough East , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as all members are aware , there has been an intense campaign by anti - sealing lobby groups using a 1 - 800 number and television ads .
members of the public are provided with scripts and told to phone their local MP .
my colleague the member for Mississauga West took objection to this practice and returned all phone calls directed to him .
in addition he wrote a letter to the Toronto Star correcting certain factual errors in the presentation .

employment
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , the political leadership of the European Union has announced that it will set job targets and establish programs to combat unemployment .
meanwhile the Liberal Government of Canada seems content to have unemployment stay at 9 % and rejects NDP proposals to set targets and timetables for job creation .
this is a shameful approach .
it should be replaced with a commitment to real jobs for real people instead of this idolatrous fascination for certain economic indicators and the false economic theories that they are a part of .
* * *
employment INSURANCE
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Brossard - La Prairie , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , last Friday , the government announced a reduction in employment insurance premiums , which represents a tax break of $ 1.4 billion .
starting January 1 , 1998 , the contribution rate for workers will drop from $ 2.90 to $ 2.70 per $ 100 in insurable earnings .
the government , moreover , has indicated its desire to reduce contribution rates in future as much as possible .
this government action is part of a broader objective to take every approach possible to ensuring the growth of the Canadian economy .
that growth is linked to job creation and the maintaining of optimum conditions for public and private investment .

curling
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to inform the House of a great Canadian contribution to the sport of curling .
next year in Nagano , Japan the Winter Olympics will include curling as a medal sport .
this week in Brandon , Manitoba , my hometown , Canada is choosing its men ' s and women ' s representatives for those Olympics .
Canadians are being treated to the most awesome display of curling talent ever assembled under one roof .
canada ' s ten best men and ten best women ' s rinks are competing for the honour to be called Canadian Olympians .
needless to say I do have a provincial bias as four of those teams come from Manitoba .
nevertheless when the victors are crowned this weekend , regardless of what province they come from they will have the support of all Canadians in their quest for gold .
congratulations to the Brandon organizing committee ' s President Pam Horn and the 900 volunteers who are once again showcasing southwestern Manitoba and the sport of curling .
Brandon has earned its reputation as a host community and the distinction of the curling capital of Canada .

diabetes AWARENESS MONTH
Mr. Paul Bonwick ( Simcoe - Grey , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , November is Diabetes Awareness Month .
on November 14 Insulin Day was celebrated worldwide .
these events are especially significant to me because the discoverer of insulin , Sir Frederick Banting , was born in the township of New Tecumseh which is part of my riding of Simcoe - Gray .
Dr. Banting has long held a special place in the hearts of Canadians and indeed the entire world for his discovery of a cure for diabetes .
i am sure that each of us have a family member , friend or a neighbour who has directly benefited from Dr. Banting ' s discovery .
in memory of a great man and a great Canadian , I encourage everyone to actively promote the role of education in the prevention and care of diabetes .
diabetes is a serious and rising health problem throughout the world , disabling more than 100 million people .
colleagues , join me in this challenge .

curtain CLUB THEATRE
Mr. Bryon Wilfert ( Oak Ridges , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , November 21 marked the 25 th anniversary of the Curtain Club Theatre at its location on Newkirk Road in Richmond Hill .
we are fortunate to have such a professional organization in our community and a group of very committed and dedicated volunteers who are involved in the production , the creation of sets and the superlative acting .
it should also be noted that the Royal Canadian Air Farce which is also celebrating its 25 th anniversary had its first show in Richmond Hill at the Curtain Club Theatre .
that tremendous Canadian comedy team has delighted Canadian audiences with their satirical comedy and down to earth humour .
their first radio broadcast was from Richmond Hill ' s Curtain Club .
Canadian theatre has been enriched by the dedication and commitment of individuals who are prepared to devote long hours of preparation , hours of hard work and effort to present entertainment to the community .
i salute both the Curtain Club Theatre and the Royal Canadian Air Farce .

LEBANON
Mr. Mark Assad ( Gatineau , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to draw attention to the presence here of the former President of Lebanon , Amin Gemayel .
Mr. Gemayel , who is visiting Canada with his lovely wife , is known to us as a staunch defender of the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon .
we would like him to know how grateful all Lebanese are to him , not only those still in Lebanon but also all those throughout this country , who share his hopes and struggle for a true Lebanese territory and peace after 17 years of conflict .
we are honoured to have this visit by former President and Mrs. Gemayel .
oral QUESTION PERIOD
canada POST
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are now in the sixth day of a postal strike that is crippling the country from coast to coast .
the cost to businesses and families is in the hundreds of millions of dollars .
thousands of workers are being laid off already .
over the weekend this government mused about legislating the postal workers back to work , but that is all it was .
it seemed to be musings and idle chatter .
when is this government going to get these postal workers back to work ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , we are monitoring the situation very closely .
the government is very concerned about the situation .
what we want is for the parties to get back to the table and come up with a collective agreement .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will tell you who is monitoring the situation .
it is families with businesses like the Lorenzes in northern Alberta and thousands of family businesses like them .
this family decided to go into the mail order book business and to pay for it they mortgaged their own home .
all they had to do was work hard and it would pay off for them , or so they thought .
but then along came the postal strike .
the Lorenzes could now lose their business , their dream and even their family home .
so this kind of answer is not good enough .
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I cannot imagine a party which always pushed for less government now pushing for more interference by government .
this is a process that has worked .
let the process work and let the parties come up with an agreement .
miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , this official opposition is a party which is pushing for final offer arbitration so we do not need to get into these strike situations all the time , as this government talks about .
the labour minister has been saying day after day in the House of Commons that the government is not going to legislate an end to the strike , it is simply going to monitor the situation .
yet the public works minister mused over the weekend and said to the Canadian Direct Marketing Association in August that he would legislate this back to work .
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
quite simply , we are not at that stage yet .
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , back to work legislation also includes a strike alternative to settle the dispute .
it is well known the government is in a position of conflict of interest due to its plans to have Canada Post reap huge profits which it then turns over to a cash hungry Liberal government .
given this conflict of interest what impartial dispute settlement mechanism does the government intend to use when it finally gets off its you know what ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have offered both sides the assistance of a mediator to help get them back to the table and come up with a collective agreement .
i ask my hon. colleague to let both sides deal with the issue and come up with an agreement that is better for both sides and let the mediator do his or her work .
Mr. Jim Gouk ( West Kootenay - Okanagan , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , strike in 1987 , legislation ; strike in 1991 , legislation .
now we have a strike in 1997 .
how many strikes is it going to take before this government recognizes the need to protect Canada ' s 30 million people and bring in a permanent no strike , no lockout solution to Canada Post disputes ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as I indicated previously to the House , I am bringing in legislation to bring Part I of the Canada Labour Code up to date .
there were consultations over the last two years and one thing that neither labour nor management pushed for was to take the collective bargaining rights away .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , last week the Prime Minister was firmly opposed to special legislation to force people back to work at Canada Post .
he said , and I quote :
- there is a strike because the Parliament of Canada has given the right to strike to this union .
that is in the law and we have to respect the law of the land by giving the two parties a chance to find a negotiated settlement .
yesterday , however , the minister responsible for Canada Post was talking about bringing in special legislation .
can the Deputy Prime Minister tell us whether the government will go with the Prime Minister ' s option of respecting the bargaining process , or that of the minister responsible for Canada Post , who spends his time threatening special legislation ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as my hon. colleague is well aware , I have not indicated anything about back to work legislation .
what I have tried to do is let the system work .
i ask my hon. colleague to do the same , to let them get back to the table and come up with an agreement that will be better for all Canadians .
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would really like to believe the Minister of Labour , but the fact is that his colleague , the minister responsible for Canada Post , has constantly brandished the threat of special legislation .
i ask the minister responsible for Canada Post if he realizes that , by his actions , he has hurt negotiations , which could lead directly to an impasse .
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , there are many things stated during negotiations but , quite simply , we have a process in this country .
under Part I of the code , it is my responsibility to see that the process is let work .
there are a number of stages in the process and that is what we are going through .
let the system work .
Mr. R 茅 jean Lefebvre ( Champlain , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , since August we have known that the situation at Canada Post would worsen , because the minister responsible accidently announced his plan for a special bill , long before the employees decided to strike .
does the government not realize that it is entirely responsible for the mess Canada Post is in for having taken two different positions , with the Minister of Labour saying he wanted negotiations to take their course and the minister responsible for Canada Post promising special legislation for the past three months ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , as I have indicated previously , I have offered the services of a mediator to both parties to let them get back to the table and come up with an agreement .
why not let CUPW and the post office use a mediator and come up with an agreement that will be better for all Canadians ?
Mr. R 茅 jean Lefebvre ( Champlain , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , did the minister not simply serve postal employees up to Canada Post Corporation with a promise from the start to deprive them early on of their right to strike with special legislation ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have made no promises .
all I have done is agree to follow the law of this country , and Part I of the Canada Labour Code happens to be part of the law of this country .
i am going to see that it is followed .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , last week the Minister of Labour was promoting a negotiated solution to the dispute at Canada Post .
he even acknowledged that back to work legislation would hinder negotiations .
however , the minister responsible for Canada Post is now threatening to impose special legislation .
why does the minister want to sabotage negotiations rather then allow the talks to take their course ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
i made sure that we followed the laws of this country and I am going to make sure that we do follow the laws of this country .
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , now we are seeing the good cop and the bad cop routine being played out on the floor of the House of Commons .
the labour minister was told earlier today that without government meddling Canada Post and its employees could reach an agreement within 72 hours .
earlier in question period this minister acknowledged that without interference the parties could negotiate an agreement .
will the labour minister reaffirm his commitment to a negotiated settlement by insisting that the planned back to work legislation be put on ice ?
hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my hon. colleague is the one who is bringing up the subject of back to work legislation .
what I have indicated is that I offered the services of a mediator from the labour program .
what I am trying to do is assist the process .
i am trying to assist CUPW and the post office to come to a collective agreement .
we should let them do their work .
we should let the mediator do his work .

employment INSURANCE
Mr. Jean Dub 茅 ( Madawaska - Restigouche , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government announced on Friday that it would be reducing EI premiums by only 20 cents , from $ 2.90 to $ 2.70 .
business leaders all over the country agree that EI premiums could be reduced by 60 cents to 70 cents .
even the actuary for the EI account says the fund could be sustained if premiums were reduced by 90 cents .
why did the Minister of Human Resources Development choose to put the interests of the Minister of Finance ahead of giving Canadians the tax relief they need , especially in view of the $ 11 billion tax hike -
the Speaker :
the hon. Minister of Human Resources Development .
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would say that the House was pretty pleased to learn on Friday morning that there was a second 10 cent decrease .
Canadians were very pleased to hear that for the fourth year in a row the premiums are decreasing .
that is good news .
Canadian business people and employees are very pleased to see that they have a system which will be sustainable for the future , not which will go into debt as it used to , because we are responsible .
Mr. Jean Dub 茅 ( Madawaska - Restigouche , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , it would be sustainable at $ 2.00 .
last week finance officials led the finance committee to believe that the auditor general agreed not to be the auditor for the CPP board .
the auditor general had to send a letter to the finance committee to clarify his position .
he clearly indicated that he believes he should be the auditor for the CPP board , yet on Friday the Minister of Finance persisted in saying that this is not the auditor general ' s position .
does the minister now have his facts straight and can he tell the House why his officials misled the finance committee ?
the Speaker :
i would prefer , colleagues , that we stay away from using such words .
i will permit the hon. Minister of Finance to answer if he wants to .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , let us be very clear .
it is unworthy of the hon. member and I would hope that he would withdraw the allegation that any official of this government would mislead a committee .
that being said , let me say that the auditor general will be given complete access to all the information in order to perform his audit .
there is an opportunity for him to be chosen as the auditor .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , on Friday the finance minister announced a cut to EI premiums that works out to less than a dime a day for Canadians -
some hon. members :
hear , hear .
Mr. Monte Solberg : - and they are clapping for it .
that is embarrassing .
if Canadians work seven days a week and take their huge tax windfall , they will be lucky to have a down payment on a cup of coffee .
that is what it works out to .
when is the finance minister going to quit nickel and diming Canadians and give them real tax relief , not a dime a day ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , that is a tax cut which represents one billion four hundred million dollars .
it is the second largest reduction in UI premiums in the history of the fund .
it follows , as my colleague has said , three previous years , in each and every one of which there was a reduction in EI premiums .
the fact is we have reversed the tendency toward increasing these premiums which were created by the previous government .
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , while the minister is dropping EI premiums by 10 cents a day , he will begin hiking CPP payroll taxes by $ 1.90 a day on January 1 , $ 3.80 for the self - employed .
when is the minister going to quit this shell game and admit that taxes are going up and not down as he is trying to lead Canadians to believe ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
they go into a separate fund which is invested for the benefit of premium contributors .
if he is so upset in his question about income taxes , would he please explain this to his colleague from Calgary - Nose Hill who has suggested a 25 % increase in personal income taxes in order to make up for the $ 600 million liability .

Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage .
the investigation of Option Canada by the Directeur g 茅 n 茅 ral des 茅 lections du Qu 茅 bec has revealed a flagrant lack of co - operation by the former administrators of that organization .
its former director of operations , Ren 茅 Lemaire , refusing to open Option Canada ' s books , lawyer Michel Hudon , who incorporated Option Canada , refusing to say what its activities were , and so on .
is it standard practice , within 20 days of incorporation , to give close to $ 5 million to people who -
the Speaker :
the Minister of Canadian Heritage .
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the amount awarded matched the full amount donated to Option souverainet 茅 by Mr. Duhaime .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have a supplementary question .
Claude Dauphin , former president of Option Canada , former Liberal MP and board member of the Council for Canadian Unity , has stated , moreover , that Option Canada was the political arm of the Council for Canadian Unity .
what political activities has the Minister of Canadian Heritage managed to finance ?
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member across the way is making certain allegations concerning statements that have been made .
i would suggest he take care , because it must be kept in mind that , on January 16 , 1997 , the Quebec minister of finance said of the Government of Quebec ' s financial statements in connection with the referendum , " It would be negligent on our part to make public the financial plan of the Government of Quebec in connection with the referendum '' .
this statement was made by the finance minister of the PQ government of Quebec .

canada PENSION PLAN
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
in the same way , he is trying to fabricate a very private audit of the CPP investment board although the auditor general has said that his department should do that audit .
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , first , that option is open to the investment board .
if that is not the case , will the hon. member now stand up and tell us how they will fund the $ 600 billion liability or is it their intention to renege on the contributions and obligations to Canadians ?
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Finance is wrong not once but twice in his response .
i will deal with the investment fund .
the fact is that the legislation shows that the CPP Investment Board will hire its own private auditor for the board .
the auditor general will not be involved in that audit .
i will ask the Minister of Finance again .
if the auditor general says that he can do it and it would be more efficient and cost effective , why will the Minister of Finance not allow public scrutiny of the CPP Investment Board ?
what is he trying to hide ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , first , there will be complete public scrutiny .
all of the information will be made available .
the auditor general will have it all made available to him and he will report on it .
the investment board has the option of either appointing an outside auditor who has greater expertise than the auditor general or in fact of appointing the auditor general .
the member should read the legislation .
why does the hon. member refuse to talk about the $ 600 billion liability ?
do Canadians have a reason to be afraid of what the Reform -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Roberval .
* * *
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , $ 4.8 million of taxpayers ' money was used by we know not whom , nor do we know why , exactly how , and when , and the Minister of Canadian Heritage is still refusing to answer any questions about Option Canada .
i would sincerely like to know the answer to the following question :
does the minister , who has on a number of occasions told the courts she has nothing to hide , not think that her most fundamental responsibility , as the minister responsible , is to answer all these questions frankly and without delay ?
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) :
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Roberval .
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , that is precisely what I am asking her for .
does the minister not realize that by taking this tack , by giving any old answer , she is guilty of a cover - up ?
hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) :

young OFFENDERS ACT
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , in the last few days we have had several incidents in Coquitlam and Saanich , B.C. and Calgary and Sunbury , Alberta , my home town , of teenage thugs savagely beating both youths and adults .
in Saanich , B.C. they took a young girl ' s life and threw her body into a gorge .
is the justice minister going to scrap this Liberal Young Offenders Act which is absolutely no deterrent to youth and has been proven to be absolutely useless ?
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
in fact , as the hon. member is probably aware , my department is preparing a government response to the standing committee report on the Young Offenders Act which was filed in this House in April .
my provincial colleagues and I will be meeting in Montreal next week and the Young Offenders Act will be one of the most important items on that agenda .
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , this is not news .
we have heard these kinds of things before .
they fly around the country with the elite .
they visit the elite .
they are supposed to be doing all this consulting .
when is this minister going to get her priorities straight ?
hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would point out to the hon. member that I believe most Canadians understand that the problem of youth crime is much more complex than that perhaps suggested by comments of the hon. member .
let me reassure the hon. member and all Canadians that we take the problem of youth crime very seriously and that is why in fact we are consulting with provincial counterparts .
we are consulting with those .
we work with young offenders to make sure that when we reform this law , we get it right .
the Speaker :
my colleagues , I know we get a little bit excited in question period , but I am having a tough time even hearing the answers .
i would ask you please to keep it down a bit .

the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of the Environment .
after environmental groups , the Canadian environmental ambassador and the Government of Quebec condemned the Regina accord on greenhouse gas emissions , we have learned this morning that a number of industrialized countries have reached a consensus at Tokyo to stabilize their greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2005 , not 2010 , as set out in the Regina accord .
is the Minister of the Environment prepared to revisit the Regina accord in order to endorse this compromise position ?
the Speaker :
the Minister of the Environment .
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I said last week that the agreement that we reached in Regina was a good consensus , but it was not the definitive time line and target of the federal government .
we will make our announcement about our target before Kyoto , but at the moment we are continuing to negotiate not only with developed nations , but developing nations as well around this very serious issue to try to make sure that we have a consensus when we go to Kyoto .

revenue CANADA
Mr. Denis Coderre ( Bourassa , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue .
Canadian taxpayers are concerned about the confidentiality of their tax files after what happened in Quebec City last week .
if taxpayers are to have faith in the taxation system , we must ensure the confidentiality of the information provided beyond a shadow of doubt .
can the parliamentary secretary assure this House and all Canadians that the information provided by taxpayers is kept confidential at Revenue Canada ?
Mrs. Sue Barnes ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
absolutely .
client confidentiality , whether it is an individual or a corporation , is the cornerstone of our system of taxation in this country .
it is voluntary compliance and we would take seriously any efforts to access information .
this is a serious matter and I would like to clearly state that Revenue Canada is well aware of this obligation and that recent press reports do not involve the department .

the ENVIRONMENT
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister said last Thursday that he does not feel bound by the November 12 federal - provincial agreement to stabilize emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2010 .
it is the provinces that have to deal with the emissions .
it is the provinces that will take the economic hit after the Kyoto agreement .
why did the Prime Minister waste the time of the provinces when he had a different timetable in mind all along ?
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the federal government and the provinces recognize that climate change is a serious and real issue that must be addressed , but they also recognize the many opportunities associated with this .
this morning I signed an agreement for the federal government with ENMAX and Vision Quest in Alberta .
our federal department will be buying green power through wind power created in Alberta .
why cannot the Reform Party understand the opportunities associated with climate change ?
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , speaking of wind power , we are getting an awful lot of it from the other side .
we are a week away from the signing of the treaty in Kyoto and Canada is the only G - 7 country that has not put its position forward because of the government ' s fumbling .
the provinces have agreed to emission levels at 1990 standards by 2010 .
now the Prime Minister is saying 2007 .
with the Kyoto signing only days away , will the minister tell the House , tell Canadians , what is the plan and how it will be implemented ?
hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , all the hot air gases in the Chamber come from the Reform Party on this issue .
this morning Petro - Canada , based in Calgary , and the Ottawa biotechnology company , Iogen , signed a landmark deal to produce pollution free motor fuels from converted agricultural and wood waste .
this issue represents many opportunities for Canada , Canadian business , industry and individuals .
when will the Reform Party understand the issue is serious and attached to many important economic opportunities ?

canada POST
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , when the Liberals were in opposition they wrote a report that said Canada Post should not pay income tax and should only generate enough profits to pay for its operating costs and to improve services to Canadians .
today the Liberal government is demanding that Canada Post pay dividends of $ 294 million over five years and $ 131 million in income tax .
this strike could be settled today if the government withdrew its unreasonable demand for profits .
will the minister of government services direct Canada Post to return to the table without the demand for dividends that is the root cause of this strike ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canada Post has been at the table from the beginning and continues to be at the table .
there was a report that looked at all the possibilities of how the corporation should be run and what were the financial implications .
the government took the report , answered the report and gave a new mandate to Canada Post .
i am sure with the negotiated settlement that mandate can be achieved .
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , Canada Post is not supposed to be a cash cow to be milked by the federal government .
the government ' s demand for profits and dividends from Canada Post has all the earmarks of getting the corporation ready for the auction block .
it is like fattening up a calf before bringing it to market .
will the minister of public works withdraw the demand for dividends from Canada Post and assure the House today that the government will never sell off and privatize this valuable asset ?
hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I do not know how many times I have to say it in French and English .
we do not want to privatize Canada Post Corporation .
we want Canada Post to continue to deliver the mail .
it is a good corporation in the global economy .
the hon. member should do as much business as we do outside Canada .
canada Post has to make a profit so it can renew its equipment and invest in modern technology .
we want to look at the future , not at the past like the New Democrats .

APEC
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Foreign Affairs has warned APEC of irrelevancy if it does not expand its scope to include human rights and environmental issues .
canada ' s EDC is backing the Three Gorges project with $ 172 million worth of Canadian taxpayers money , when the World Bank , CIDA and the U.S. Ex - Im Bank will not back the Three Gorges project based on environmental and human rights concerns .
based on his own criteria stated at APEC , does the Minister of Foreign Affairs feel that Canada ' s foreign policy with Asia has become irrelevant ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , at the APEC ministerial meeting this past week a couple of important steps were taken .
first , it was agreed by all ministers that questions dealing with the consequences of economic change and trade liberalization impacts upon labour markets would be a matter for consideration under the human resource working group of ministers .
that would involve a combination of labour and management consultations to ensure we are able to examine the full consequences .

land MINES
Mr. David Pratt ( Nepean - Carleton , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Industry .
in early December nations from more than 100 countries will come to Ottawa to sign the treaty banning anti - personnel mines .
recently I contacted the minister to suggest that the government spearhead an effort to exhibit Canada ' s leading edge land mine clearing technology at this conference .
could the minister advise the House what progress has been made by his department on this suggestion ?
hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I solute the hon. member for Nepean - Carleton who came forward with this suggestion .
as a result I am pleased to advise the House that we will be hosting a Canadian de - mining showcase in Ottawa on December 3 and 4 , concurrently with the signing of the Ottawa declaration .
the availability of technology is not only to give effect to the terms of the treaty in which Canada has played such an important role but to give availability of solutions to people whose lives have disrupted by the unfortunate consequence of land mines .
* * *
export DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , last week I informed the House that the president of EDC , Export Development Corporation , Ian Gillespie , told the foreign affairs committee that EDC is reluctant to sign the code of ethics championed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
how can Canadian corporations be asked to sign this code of ethics when Canadian crown agencies will not play by the same rules ?
will the Minister for International Trade restore relevancy to Canada ' s foreign policy by ensuring that EDC signs the code of ethics of the Minister of Foreign Affairs ?
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Economic Development Corporation must subscribe to the policies of the federal government which de facto make it subscribe to a code of ethics set down by the government .
the code of ethics described there is for businesses that are not signed on and it is voluntary .

taxation
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the riding I represent is made up of small business people , single parents , working families and seniors .
they are trying to make ends meet .
these Canadians do not want government handouts .
all they want is the government to take its hands out their pockets .
my question is for the Minister of Finance .
his so - called latest tax relief is simply nickels and dimes .
when will he listen to these Canadians and commit today to bringing in real tax relief for small businesses , single parents , working families and seniors ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , $ 1.4 billion may be nickels and dimes to the hon. member .
to Canadians that happens to be real money .
at the same time the $ 850 million my colleague , the Minister of Human Resources , put forth in terms of the child tax benefit , the second $ 850 million that will be coming , also happens to be real money .
the tax relief that is being provided to students happens to be real money .
the fact that the government has succeeded as a result of a clean - up of the balance sheet in bringing down mortgage rates and bringing down car purchase rates happens to be real money .

dairy PRODUCTS
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr 茅 tien ( Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , BQ ) :
is the Minister of Agriculture aware of the danger of allowing the situation to worsen and does he intend to continue to take the appropriate action to protect our dairy producers whose quotas have dropped by nearly 3 % ?
hon. Gilbert Normand ( Secretary of State ( Agriculture and Agri - Food ) ( Fisheries and Oceans ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased the hon. member raised the question , which is indeed of concern to our dairy producers .
an agreement has been signed on import products , including butter .
at the moment this product meets the requirements of the agreement .
we are looking at ways to amend the agreement , but if we amend the agreement for butter oil , we also have to amend it for the other products .
* * *
ports CANADA
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport .
in July the Vancouver detachment of Ports Canada police was disbanded .
the Vancouver Port Corporation charged multinational shipping companies a fee for using the port facilities , part of which paid for the ports police services at no cost to Canadian taxpayers .
since July the Vancouver police department took over ports policing .
that cost was supposed to be $ 1 million .
there are indications that just since July it may be $ 1.5 million .
given that the government promised the disbanding of Ports Canada police would not cost Canadian taxpayers -
the Speaker :
the hon. member for Markham .

canada PENSION PLAN
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , if I understood him , the Minister of Finance indicated the CPP investment board would choose its own auditors .
the minister said that someone from the outside may have more expertise .
an auditor ' s job is not to protect the board of directors but to protect the shareholders , Canadians .
why is the auditor general not given access through the legislation to the information that will allow him to ensure Canadians are protected ?
hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the government has made it very clear that the auditor general will be given complete access to all the information he requires to complete his audit .
he will be auditing the Canada pension plan .
if in fact the legislation is not sufficiently clear we have indicated that we will make it clear in order to ensure that very thing .
the investment board will have the option of either choosing an outside auditor or the auditor general .
the fact is it may well decide , because the provinces are also involved , that an outside auditor would have far greater expertise in that specific area .
that is a decision for the board to make .

youth EMPLOYMENT
Mr. Steve Mahoney ( Mississauga West , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development .
in its first mandate the government tackled youth unemployment head on by establishing the youth employment strategy .
however unemployment continues to be a serious problem for Canada ' s young people .
what initiatives has the minister taken to address this important issue ?
hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for Mississauga West who I know cares very much about youth employment .
almost 20,000 youngsters have been helped by Youth Internship Canada , 60,000 by the student career plan , 60,000 youths who got summer jobs , and another 60,000 got jobs related to their actual studies .

highways
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris - Moose Mountain , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , each year the government opposite takes $ 5 billion out of the motoring public in fuel taxes .
my question is for the Minister of Transport .
the Canadian Automobile Association has stated on numerous occasions that 20 % of the taxes being returned from that fuel tax would solve our problem .
when will the minister return 20 % -
the Speaker :
the Minister of Transport .
hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the federal government has been involved in assisting the provinces with highway construction since 1919 so in effect a national highways program has been going on for many years .
the question is not should we have such a program but what conditions should we attach to its continuation and how much money is involved .
on the specific question of taxes this is something I am sure that other colleagues will deal with , perhaps the Minister of Finance , at a later date .
there is no question that we have a program .
we have just announced the extension of the agreement with New Brunswick .
i hope we can continue that over the years .
* * *
pay EQUITY
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon ( Qu 茅 bec , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , the President of Treasury Board has always placed a ceiling of $ 1.3 billion on any pay equity settlement with its employees .
the Minister responsible for the Status of Women , however , has just stated that the federal government apparently has more money available to end this dispute .
so why is the President of the Treasury Board delaying settlement of the pay equity issue , when we now know he has more money in his pocket to resolve matters ?
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , with respect to the issue of pay equity , last April we offered a settlement that would have amounted to $ 842 million .
we increased this offer by $ 500 million between April and August , and during that time the union made no concessions with respect to its demands .
negotiating consists basically of two parties reaching a compromise .
we are waiting for the union to make a reasonable compromise , and we will then be ready to negotiate a solution .
the Speaker :
my colleagues , that would bring to a close our question period .

point OF ORDER
main ESTIMATES
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point or order with respect to the main estimates which were tabled in the House on Wednesday , October 1 , 1997 and which have just been returned from committee study and are to be concurred in shortly .
my point of order concerns irregularities with certain of these estimates .
however , I would like to point out that as Madam Speaker Sauv 茅 said on June 12 , 1981 , as recorded in Hansard at page 10546 , it matters not whether the amount spent is a large sum or simply $ 1 .
it is the parliamentary process to which I am objecting today .
in this regard I would like to bring to your attention several votes which I believe to be out of order and inappropriate for inclusion in the subsequent appropriation bill flowing from these estimates .
going as far back as 1971 , members of this House have repeatedly objected to the government ' s use of the estimates as a vehicle to amend legislation and to seek authority to spend money on programs that have not received legislative authority .
your distinguished predecessors , Mr. Speaker , have consistently ruled in support of these arguments for striking votes from the estimates on March 10 , 1971 , March 22 , 1977 , December 7 , 1977 , March 25 , 1981 , June 12 , 1981 , June 21 , 1981 , March 21 , 1983 and March 21 , 1984 .
Mr. Speaker Jerome in a landmark ruling on March 22 , 1977 , at page 4221 of the Debates , stated that the government received from Parliament the authority to act through the passage of legislation and receives the money to finance such authorized action through the passage by Parliament of an Appropriation Act .
this decision flowed in part from rulings of Mr. Speaker Lamoureux who , on February 5 , 1973 , at pages 94 and 95 of Journals , stated that the authorizing bill must become law before the authorization of the relevant estimates by the Appropriation Act .
that legislation is a necessary precondition to sanction grants of supply is also based upon ancient constitutional usage as Erskine May ' s Parliamentary Practice 25 th edition states at page 689 .
flowing from early British laws and customs through the Constitution Act and on to Standing Order 80 ( 1 ) , it is claimed that all aids and supplies granted to the sovereign are the sole gift of the House of Commons .
although the task of governing belongs to the crown , it cannot possibly provide as many services to the people unless the funds in the consolidated revenue fund are made available to it .
these funds can only be made available to the crown by the House of Commons .
the House insists that the crown , when requesting funds , must specify the particular purposes for which the funds are required .
it is therefore this claim to the right of control over the purse strings of the nation that we must defend vigorously and retain for this House alone .
in this defence I now bring to your attention , Mr. Speaker , the fact that eight votes in the main estimates are not properly before this House .
five votes in the estimates seek parliamentary approval for funds which have not yet received legislative authority .
three votes are attempting to legislate through the application of the Appropriation Acts .
first , the Department of Agriculture and Agri - food in its vote No. 1 , operating expenditures , has an activity entitled " Policy and Farm Programs " which , among other things , concerns the Canadian Wheat Board .
as outlined in its part III , expenditure plans , the department will implement changes which centre on revamping the Canadian Wheat Board .
however , no such legislation has been passed to permit this action .
it was , however , reintroduced as Bill C - 4 on September 25 , 1997 and , as of this date , has not received royal assent .
i should note here that the part II book , commonly referred to as the blue book , listing the estimates as they will appear in a subsequent Appropriation Act , does not give sufficient detail concerning each vote .
thus , it is necessary to refer to the part IIIs for details of departmental plans and priorities with respect to the funds they are requesting this House to approve .
we must use the part II book since it mirrors the proposed Appropriation Act approving the estimates .
as it is difficult to determine precisely the amount of any particular item within each respective vote , I therefore ask you , Mr. Speaker , to strike vote No. 1 of the Department of Agriculture and Agri - food from the estimates since it contains funds to finance programs which have yet to receive parliamentary approval .
second , the Immigration and Refugee Board under vote 15 , program expenditures , in its convention refugee determination division activity , has indicated that it would begin single member hearings in mid - 1997 which is in conflict with the Immigration Act .
legislation that was introduced in the last Parliament , Bill C - 49 to amend section 69.1 of the Immigration Act , died on the Order Paper before receiving second reading .
as a result , the board , as indicated in part III and inherently in part II in the estimates , is operating outside legislative authority for its funds as presented in the estimates .
again , since we must use the part II book containing the estimates and as it is difficult to determine precisely the amount of this particular item within the vote , I therefore ask you , Mr. Speaker , to remove vote 15 of the Immigration and Refugee Board from the estimates .
a similar situation is occurring at Environment Canada .
within its vote 1 , operating expenditures , the department has activities called " healthy environment " and " safety from environmental hazards " wherein it has set a key initiative to fully implement the new Canadian Environmental Protection Act and the Canada Endangered Species Protection Act .
neither of these two pieces of legislation has received royal assent .
the Canadian Environmental Protection Act was introduced in the last Parliament as Bill C - 74 on December 10 , 1996 but did not receive second reading .
the Canadian Endangered Species Protection Act , Bill C - 65 in the previous Parliament , reached report stage before Parliament was dissolved .
again , since we must use the part II book containing the estimates and as it is difficult to determine precisely the amount of this particular item within the vote , I therefore ask you , Mr. Speaker , to strike vote 1 of Environment Canada from the estimates .
the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , within its Indian and Inuit affairs program at vote 5 , operating expenditures , under the sub - activity of lands and trusts services , is working toward devolution and economic opportunities through sustainable development of natural resources with the help of various pieces of legislation that were introduced in the last Parliament but did not receive royal assent .
some of these bills have been reintroduced , namely C - 6 , Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Act and C - 8 , the Canada - Yukon Oil and Gas Act .
however , the modifications to the Indian Act , formerly Bill C - 79 , have yet to be presented to this House .
again , we must use the part II book containing the estimates , and since it is difficult to determine precisely the amount of this particular item within the vote , I therefore ask you , Mr. Speaker , to delete vote 5 of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development from the estimates .
my fifth point concerns Transport Canada .
a bill to authorize these undertakings was introduced in the last Parliament as Bill C - 44 , but it only reached the third reading stage on April 16 , 1997 before dying on the Order Paper .
today , Bill C - 9 , a repeat of the former Bill C - 44 , is at report stage and Bill C - 9 includes clause 197 which repeals the Canada Ports Corporation .
the departmental estimates show that payments to the Canada Ports Corporation have been reduced to zero which indicates that the department is in fact implementing C - 9 , which leads me to believe that the other items of Bill C - 9 which require the expenditure of funds is also contained within the vote .
with the corporation ' s budget being reduced to zero , how else would the department be able to operate ?
once again we must use the part II book that contains the estimates .
as it is difficult to determine precisely the amount of this item within the vote , I therefore ask Mr. Speaker to strike vote 1 of the Department of Transport from the estimates .
the next group of three departments and agencies indicated in part III seeks parliamentary approval for funds for operational needs but in doing so is amending legislation through the use of an appropriation act .
in this regard I refer to Speaker Jerome ' s ruling on March 22 , 1977 at page 4220 of Debates when he said that changes in legislation ought to be dealt with by legislation and not by supply items .
the Speaker :
colleagues , this point of order could have far reaching effects .
i would like to hear what the hon. member has to say .
if you have other meetings I would invite you please to use the lobbies .
i would very much like to hear this point of order and I am being a little distracted .
i return to the hon. member for St. Albert .
Mr. John Williams :
Mr. Speaker , first is the Canadian International Trade Tribunal which through vote 35 on program expenditures is extending its mandate with the implementation of the agreement on government procurement .
to date there is no legislative authority to extend the tribunal ' s mandate , as set out in the Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act , allowing it to hear complaints pursuant to this agreement which has yet to be brought before Parliament for confirmation .
again we must use the part II book containing the estimates .
as it is difficult to determine precisely the amount of this item within the vote , I therefore ask Mr. Speaker to strike vote 35 of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal from the estimates .
a second irregularity comes from the Department of Public Works and Government Services .
under the supply and services program vote 15 , program expenditures , is the Canada Communication Group ' s revolving fund , which is a special operating agency .
it was established in 1990 in part pursuant to section 29.1 of the Financial Administration Act and is responsible for the government ' s printing and publishing operations .
in March 1997 the department officially privatized the Canada Communications Group .
parliament is now being asked to increase the CCG revolving fund by $ 21 million due to the sale of the printing services and distribution logistics services of CCG according to part I book of the estimates .
to date no such legislation has been introduced into this House to amend this act .
the department is in effect legislating through the use of an appropriation act .
it is important to note that although the CCG item in the estimates is listed as a statutory item , it is not placed there just for information , as used to be the case with previous legislative items such as salaries for ministers .
i draw attention to the fact that since 1991 , section 29 ( 1 ) of the Financial Administration Act allowed revolving fund agencies to use appropriation acts to change the purposes and draw down limits , thereby giving Parliament the right to be involved in their affairs .
as a consequence , I ask that this item , as indicated at page 1 - 58 of the part II book of estimates , be deleted .
finally , there is an unusual establishment of the Canada Information Office and its vote 40 , program expenditures .
this office was established by order in council on July 9 , 1996 under the authority of the Financial Administration Act , section 3 ( 1 ) ( a ) by renaming the voluntary action program as the Canada Information Office and placing it under schedule I ( 1 ) of the Financial Administration Act .
the Financial Administration Act permits the governor in council to add the name of any division or branch of the public service to schedule I ( 1 ) .
however , the voluntary action program was neither a division nor a branch of either the department of communications or the Department of Canadian Heritage .
in addition , it should be noted that the Financial Administration Act uses the word add , not the word create , thereby justifying my argument .
furthermore , I would argue establishing an agency by an order in council certainly does not meet the definition of legislative authority as expressed by Speaker Jerome who said in part on December 7 , 1977 , as recorded in Hansard at page 1642 that the legislative process requires three readings , committee stage and , in other words , ample time for members to participate in debate and amendment .
the Canada Information Office subsequently sought to obtain legislative status through the supplementary estimates in an appropriation act .
nevertheless on March 22 , 1977 at page 4220 of Hansard , Speaker Jerome ruled that supplementary estimates ought not to be used as a means to seek funds for new programs , as these supplementary estimates are only for short duration .
this point was reiterated by Madam Speaker Sauv 茅 on June 12 , 1981 at page 10546 of Debates when she said that the Appropriation Act is not the place to seek authority to do something such as to establish a new program .
rather , that act should only seek authority to spend money for a program that has been previously authorized by statute .
again , as quoted in Beauchesne ' s sixth edition at citation 938 , she expanded on this on March 21 , 1983 at page 23968 of Hansard by declaring that the previous amendment of legislation by an appropriation act cannot justify a repeated use of an item in the estimates to amend legislation .
therefore , in accordance with these Speaker ' s rulings , I ask that vote 40 of the Canada Information Office be deleted from the estimates .
i must at this time indicate my dismay with the practices of this government .
the main estimates for the fiscal year 1997 - 98 were tabled in this House on February 20 , 1997 .
because Parliament was dissolved , the main estimates were not approved by June in accordance with the standing orders .
in my view this action is an expression of this government ' s contempt of this House which requires this House to defend vigorously its sole right to grant supply .
i submit that the votes I cited , Mr. Speaker , are in fact all out of order .
i respectfully ask that you so rule .
in conclusion , if we are to protect this institution in our role as the sole granter of aids and supplies from misuse by the crown , then surely it is imperative that we follow the proper parliamentary procedures with respect to that supply process and within the rule of law which was so often quoted by the Minister of Justice in the last Parliament with respect to another issue .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will not be quite as long as my colleague .
the official opposition is bringing this to your attention today because we feel it strikes at the very heart of this democratic institution we have here .
the government is attempting to usurp the authority and responsibility of this House and its members .
this is far from a routine point of order .
does government operate through the legislation of the people or does government operate outside of the very legislation it expects all citizens to be guided by ?
as you are aware , this responsibility of the House represents a basic principle of our Constitution .
the fundamental principle that the crown has no power to tax except by grant of Parliament is to be found even in the Magna Carta .
the bill of rights of 1689 declares : " Levying money for or to the use of the crown by pretence of prerogative without grant of Parliament for longer time or in another manner than the same is or shall be granted is illegal '' .
as a result , we are governed today by rules that make it illegal for the executive to make expenditures except those expenditures that are approved by Parliament in ways approved by Parliament .
the member for St. Albert has argued that certain items in the main estimates have breached these rules because they lack the sanctioning of necessary legislation .
to support his argument , I refer to citation 937 of Beauchesne ' s sixth edition :
the test which items must meet to be included in the Estimates is whether or not the government is putting forward a spending estimate under authority it already possesses , or whether it is really seeking new legislative authority to do something .
it makes no difference whether an item attempts to spend a large sum or simply one dollar .
the government may not , by the use of an appropriation act , obtain authority it does not have under existing legislation .
our extensive research by a number of well qualified people finds that no authority exists in the areas we have defined .
citation 935 puts it simply like this :
a supply item ought not to be used to obtain authority which is the proper subject of legislation .
i would support the member ' s claim that the amounts objected to in vote 35 concerning the Canadian International Trade Tribunal , vote 15 of the department of public works , and vote 40 concerning the Canada Information Office are without legislative authority .
the member for St. Albert has also objected to the amounts in vote 1 of the department of agriculture , vote 15 concerning the Immigration and Refugee Board , vote 1 of environment , vote 5 concerning the department of Indian affairs and vote 1 of the Department of Transport .
he argues that these items seek spending authority in legislation not yet passed in Parliament .
citation 941 of Beauchesne ' s sixth edition makes the case :
if a vote in the Estimates relates to a bill not yet passed by Parliament then the authorizing bill must become law before the authorization of the relevant vote in the Estimates by an appropriation act .
this is a mandate , not a request .
citation 942 points out :
asking for money in the Estimates before legislation is passed to establish programmes " puts the cart before the horse '' .
through these items in the main estimates the government is attempting to spend the dowry and plan the honeymoon before popping the question .
our rules are based on tradition , and before the government books the honeymoon suite in the Niagara Falls Hilton , it must take us out on three successful dates : second reading , report stage and third reading .
it must also court our neighbours next door , not to mention the final approval from dad in Rideau Hall .
in conclusion , Mr. Speaker , I would like to draw to your attention a reference from the introduction of the main estimates document part II , the very document which introduces these estimates .
it states : " Proposals included in votes seek authority during the 1997 - 98 fiscal year to make expenditures necessary to deliver various mandates which are under the administration of a minister and are contained in legislation approved by Parliament '' .
that in fact is not true .
the very document which contains breaches of our parliamentary rules ironically sets those rules out in its introduction .
to knowingly state the rules and then ignore those rules makes a mockery of every member in this House and those who elected us .
this represents another disturbing attempt by the government to erode the influence of the Commons and render its members irrelevant .
it has demonstrated this by introducing bills in the Senate , advertising the passage of bills before they are passed and setting up bodies based on legislation not yet approved by Parliament , this House .
today the government is going too far with this attempt to spend money without legislative authority .
we ask that you protect the ancient constitutional right of the Commons to insist on legislative authority as a precondition to sanction grants of supply .
the only words that go into the appropriation act are the words that appear in part II of the estimates .
as we know , last year the part IIIs of the estimates were tabled only later because they include information on subsequent years .
nothing in part I or part III appears in the appropriation act .
only the precise wording in part II appears in the appropriation act and therefore has the force of law .
our procedure depends on the wording in part II only and in nothing else .
Mr. Speaker , before going too much further in this intervention , I would like to point out that the government has shown high respect for this House in the way it has handled the estimates process and everything else .
some hon. members :
oh , oh .
hon. Don Boudria :
before the election was called -
the Speaker :
i appeal to you , my colleagues .
i want to hear what is being said , so I would ask you please to refrain from heckling .
hon. Don Boudria :
Mr. Speaker , before the election was called , the government sought interim supply to last through the election period .
in so doing , it obtained the consent of this House for the functioning of Parliament both during the election period and in the subsequent period .
this is something that has seldom been done before , if ever .
i would like to add there was co - operation of members on all sides of the House , and the House leaders in particular , who saw fit to arrive at a formula whereby we could debate supply and provide for the number of opposition days and arrive at the day at which we will have arrived tomorrow , which is the final day for debating supply and the subsequent appropriation bill .
this was done with the consent of all parties and I thank all hon. members .
the part IIIs of course do not form the principal element of this issue .
i want to address a few of the issues that have been raised in detail by the hon. member .
it has been said that the wheat board item should be set aside because appropriation is being sought where according to the opposition no government bill setting out the details has yet been passed .
i would like to suggest two things .
first is that every one of these bills that is before the House where necessary has a royal recommendation regarding the crown ' s prerogative to spend money .
second is that of course this could not be done without having proper supply .
to that extent I want to indicate first that this is not an expenditure in itself .
this is merely an action by these estimates providing for the funding for the expenditure .
of course the money would not be spent either without the bill or the attending royal recommendation if such is required under a particular act .
there is another thing which I believe is quite important for the Chair to consider .
those very same expenditures were voted on in the interim supply last March .
i submit to the Chair that if this argument on the part of the opposition is all that valid , we have to wonder why it was not valid according to the same sources and the same people only a few months ago .
if the House had no problem in voting interim supply on the exact same wording as part IIs last March , I submit that the House is equally qualified to vote on these same estimates as they are when it votes on these estimates presumably late in the day tomorrow .
it could very well be that the President of the Treasury Board might want to add to the comments I have just made .
nothing I have said should be equated with my speaking on his behalf .
on behalf of the government generally , in terms of how these estimates were put together , I do believe that they were constructed in a good and appropriate way according to the customs of the House and not only that , but according to the way the House voted on many of the same items only a few months ago , namely in March 1997 .
that is the submission I wish to make to the Chair .
i ask the Chair to consider that the point made by hon. members across is not valid and that the estimates as they are presently printed are in order and should be disposed of at the appropriate time which could be tomorrow .
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have two or three points I would like to raise on this same point of order .
i can tell that all members of the House realize the importance of this point of order not only to the government but to the opposition and to Parliament itself .
this cuts to the very core of why we are here , which is to approve legislation and the funding required to carry it out .
if we follow through on the government ' s request , to follow the logic of the government House leader , he says that just because we approve the estimates is no big deal because nothing happens until the legislation is passed .
if that is true , then the entire estimates process is a sham .
we approve the estimates in good faith assuming that the government will follow through on the spending contained therein .
to bypass the estimates process , which is to scrutinize it to make sure that the money is spent where and when it is authorized and so on , is truly putting the cart before the horse .
the expenditures are being approved before legislation is in place to give the government the authority to do so .
second , I would point out that the goodwill arrangement and the negotiations that go on between the government and opposition parties with respect to supply days is carried out in good faith .
again that is irrelevant to this argument today , which is that supply cannot be voted on unless the legislation has been approved .
we can negotiate in good faith and arrange days for debate .
there is a supply day tomorrow but that is irrelevant to the point of order which is before you today , Mr. Speaker , which again comes down to which comes first , the law or the estimates ?
third , earlier in this Parliament , Mr. Speaker , you ruled on a point of order that I brought forward with respect to the creation of an investment board by Bill C - 2 , which is a bill not yet passed .
although you ruled at that time that because no money had been spent the bill was not contradicting my privileges as a parliamentarian , you did admonish the government .
you said words to the effect that you took this very seriously .
you admonished the finance department and those responsible for putting these types of things together .
they were right at the edge and you said that you took it very seriously .
you said that this was not the first time it had happened and that you hoped it would not happen again .
tomorrow if you allow the estimates to proceed as tabled , we will not only be near the edge , we will be down in the abyss , at the bottom looking up at what used to be a very noble procedure where laws were put in place and then appropriations were given .
Mr. Speaker , I would urge you to look at the arguments presented by members on this side of the House today .
to not do what was asked by the hon. member for St. Albert would be to neuter the role of parliamentarians in their attempts to bring all the light which is necessary to bear on the estimates process .
Mr. Speaker , I urge you to realize that the line has been crossed .
i urge you to make the proper decision tomorrow , which I hope will be that these estimates votes be deleted from tomorrow ' s voting .
the Speaker :
is the hon. government House leader rising to present new information ?
hon. Don Boudria :
Mr. Speaker , I want to comment pursuant to the last remark that was made and not comment on anything that was said previously pursuant to how you instructed us .
commenting only on what the hon. member has just said and adding new information to that , the reverse of what the hon. member has just stated would be totally illogical .
if one could ever conceive that this government would pass all kinds of legislation and royal recommendations inherent involving the spending of money and provide no funding within its estimates for the programs it was planning to deliver , this would essentially mean that all of us would be legislating and no program could ever be put together in the same calendar year .
you would have to provide funding only for subsequent years because you would never be providing funding in order to make it happen .
a situation like that would be totally irresponsible and unworkable .
conversely , if governments were to plan to spend money in legislation and never have anything in the estimates in the same year to provide for it and to go ahead with it right away , it would be the same people across the way challenging the government .
they would be indicating , and probably quite correctly , that in fact the government is undertaking new expenditures for which it has received no authority under appropriation .
it cannot be both ways .
i do not believe the last point raised adds to the point made before by the hon. member .
what has just been stated now adds to the credibility of the government and the way in which the estimates were put together .
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) :
second , just briefly on the issue , it is a longstanding tradition that ministers appear before the standing committees .
speaking as the chief opposition critic for the minister of agriculture , the minister responsible for this first disputed item , vote 1 , policy and farm programs , has not given the opportunity to members of Parliament and me as the critic to question him about that expenditure .
had that happened perhaps some of this could have been avoided .
i am informed a large number of ministers have not appeared .
now with the seventh and last supply day being tomorrow , as was indicated by agreement effectively if ministers appear subsequently they will not actually be debating the estimates or have any effect on whether those estimates can be reduced following their cross - examination at committee .
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have one small point again in rebuttal to the government House leader .
much legislation died on the order paper when parliament was dissolved last April and that included the main estimates .
the main estimates were reintroduced without any changes whatsoever on October 1 .
however , because the government did not reintroduce the legislation that died , it was obvious its agenda had changed .
if the government ' s agenda had changed , if its decision about what was to be spent and what was not to be spent had changed , surely it had an obligation to the House to amend and introduce the estimates to reflect its agenda after the election , not the one before .
the Speaker :
to say the least an interesting point of order has been raised .
i will surely take into consideration the information and the opinions of both sides .
i will take all these things into consideration and report to the House after I have reviewed everything .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of information .
i presume you are telling us that you would report back to the House prior to the vote on the estimates tomorrow night .
the Speaker :
i will endeavour to do that and hopefully I will be able to do that .
Mr. Randy White :
Mr. Speaker , we are saying in effect that a vote on the current estimates is quite frankly illegal .
it would be inappropriate for the House to vote on the estimates as they stand .
the Speaker :
i will take all of this into consideration in trying to make my decision .
i will make a decision not based upon the pressures of time necessarily , although it is a factor , but I will base my decision on the material I can gather to make a decision for the House that I will not have to overrule or overturn some place down the road .

national DEFENCE AND VETERANS AFFAIRS
Mr. Robert Bertrand ( Pontiac - Gatineau - Labelle , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to table the first report of the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs .
may I take this opportunity to thank the members and staff of both committees , defence and foreign affairs , who travelled to Bosnia and saw firsthand what a great job our troops were doing not only in keeping peace but also helping so many citizens to pick up the pieces and to rebuild their lives .
they have made a great impression on the international community and have made Canadians everywhere proud and happy to live in such a beautiful country .
i am pleased to table the report which was adopted unanimously by all parties that were in agreement that our presence in Bosnia should be continued until June 1998 .
in closing , I also wish to extend an acknowledgement of extreme gratitude to the troops , embassy staff and Canadians who greeted us with open arms and made sure that our visit was complete and all inclusive .
foreign AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Mr. Bill Graham ( Toronto Centre - Rosedale , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the second report of the Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs and International Trade .
in order to assist the government in its decision on whether to recommend Canadian military personnel to participate in the international stabilization force currently operating in Bosnia , a delegation of four members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade and four members of the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs , as mentioned by my colleague , the chairman of the committee , visited Bosnia two weeks ago .
i would also like to take this opportunity to thank all those who provided us with assistance during our visit and to say how impressed we were with the work being done by the Canadian military , diplomatic and NGO staff in the region .
industry
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the third report of the Standing Committee on Industry .
in accordance with its order of reference of Wednesday , October 22 , 1997 , our committee has considered Bill C - 5 , an act respecting co - operatives , and has agreed on Thursday , November 20 , 1997 , to report it with amendment .
justice AND HUMAN RIGHTS
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen ( Windsor - St.
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present , in both official languages , the second report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights .
pursuant to Standing Order 108 ( 2 ) your committee proceeded to review the circumstances leading up to and surrounding its consideration of Bill C - 16 .
because the report relates to the ability of members of the House of Commons to function effectively , we have taken the additional step of requesting that the government provide us with a response to the report in accordance with Standing Order 109 .
procedure AND HOUSE AFFAIRS
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present the 12 th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs regarding membership of some committees .
if the House gives its consent , I intend to move concurrence in the 12 th report later this day .

access TO INFORMATION ACT
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 286 , an act to amend the Access to Information Act and amending the National Archives of Canada Act as a consequence ( destruction and falsification of documents and access to confidences of the Privy Council ) .
the proposed amendments are very important , given what is regularly reported by the media , since they would allow us to have access to documents of the Privy Council which are currently confidential .
i can assure you that my proposed amendments to these two acts reflect in every way the information commissioner ' s concerns and expectations .
i hope that all members of this House will support my initiative , so as to give more visibility , more access and more teeth to the Access to Information Act , and particularly to include penalties for those who do their utmost to prevent its application .

Mr. Daniel Turp :
Mr. Speaker , I move :
[ English ]
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
Mr. Chairman , the Bloc Quebecois once again proposes a way to better introduce the treaty into domestic law and , to this end , I noted on reading the implementation legislation that an important part of article 3 of the convention had been omitted from clause 10 .
i take this opportunity as well to point out that , at a meeting of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade , a representative of the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines pointed out the importance of this provision and of the part on the minimum number of anti - personnel mines that should be kept by the states .
accordingly , I would like the bill to be amended to include the last section of article 3.1 of the treaty in clause 10 .
i move :
that Bill C - 22 , in Clause 10 , be amended by adding after line 39 on page 4 the following :
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Chairman , we support the hon. member ' s amendment .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , although this amendment has some good points , it is really irrelevant to this bill .
it is not necessary , adds nothing to the bill and we oppose this amendment .
the Chairman :
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Chairman :
all those in favour of the amendment will please say yea .
some hon. members :
yea .
the Chairman :
all those opposed will please say nay .
some hon. members :
nay .
the Chairman :
in my opinion the yeas have it .
an hon. member :
on division .
the Chairman :
i declare the amendment carried .
( amendment agreed to )
( clause 10 , as amended , agreed to )
the Chairman :
shall clause 11 carry ?
( on clause 11 )
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I believe the government has an amendment to this clause .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Chairman , as I indicated in my speech during second reading stage , when we looked at this clause we wanted to absolutely ensure that the charter requirement is absolutely honoured .
i therefore move :
that Bill C - 22 , in clause 11 , be amended by replacing lines 13 to 16 on page 5 with the following :
application for Court Order
" ( 2 ) If a person objects to providing or fails to provide any requested document or information within the specified time , the minister may apply to a judge of a superior court or the Federal Court - Trial Division for an order requiring the person to provide it ,
notice of Hearing
( 3 ) The minister shall give the person at least seven days notice of the hearing of the application .
order
( 4 ) On hearing the application , the judge may order the person to provide the document or information if the judge concludes that , in the circumstances of the case , the production of the document or information is necessary to ensure Canada ' s compliance with the convention and that the public interest outweighs in importance the privacy interests of the person . "
the Chairman :
the question is on the amendment .
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
Mr. Chairman , I simply want to ensure that the legislation is properly translated in the French version .
i think the subclause ( 2 ) should read " division de premi 猫 re instance " rather than " section de premi 猫 re instance '' .
if this is so , I would like the word " section " replaced by the word " division " in subclause ( 2 ) of the French version of the amendment introduced by the minister .
i understand someone is checking on this .
the Chairman :
perhaps while this is being considered we could hear from the hon. member for Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , who wants to speak to this debate .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Chairman , I wonder from the minister and his advisors what he believes reasonable grounds are and what provisions exist within this part of the bill to protect the privacy of members of the public .
it seems to be somewhat heavy handed in that it gives the minister and extraordinary amount of power to enter or require information from people .
i would like to have him define what reasonable grounds are .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Chairman , it is for the reason the hon. member mentions that we are proposing the amendment .
rather than simply having the minister declare that information must be provided as is required under the convention concerning the possession or acquisition of land mines , we are proposing an amendment that would require us to ask a judge to give a court order after hearing the proper evidence that the requirements of the treaty would outweigh the public interests or privacy interests .
we are giving the court the authority to make that judgment , not the minister .
Mr. Daniel Turp :
Mr. Chairman , I have noticed that this amendment seems to involve an amendment to another provision of the bill , clause 21 , and that , if I understood correctly , contravention of clause 11 ( 2 ) will no longer be considered an offence , as was originally provided in clause 21 .
i would like to know why clause 11 ( 2 ) is no longer mentioned in clause 21 under the subsequent amendment .
i want an explanation for why 11 ( 2 ) is being removed from the list in clause 21 .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy :
Mr. Chairman , the reason why we take out the reference to 11 ( 2 ) in 21 is that we do not want to presume or pre - empt a judgment by a judge .
i have always been very careful in my career never to try to presume what a judge is going to do .
it would be very wise in this case to do the same .
the Chairman :
is there now agreement regarding the wording of the French version ?
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
Mr. Chairman , we are waiting a few moments to have the translation of the terms queried by the hon. member for Beauharnois - Salaberry checked .
the Chairman :
perhaps we could move on to other clauses of the bill for the time being .
is that agreed ?
some hon. members :
agreed
( clauses 12 to 14 inclusive agreed to )
( on Clause 15 )
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
Mr. Chairman , I have a question about clause 15 ( 4 ) .
basically it talks about not getting a warrant .
we did have legal counsel explain to us that this is when mines are being rushed out the back door and we want to apprehend people .
i guess that is all right .
the only thing is it seems there is room for abuse .
is there any way to fix that or tighten it up ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Chairman , that was put in there explicitly to take into account that the House is presently considering what are called the Feney amendments to the Criminal Code .
they take into account these extenuating circumstances .
this is meant to be consistent with the particular Criminal Code change which is being made .
( clauses 15 and 16 agreed to )
( on clause 17 )
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
Mr. Chairman , guided by the attention to accuracy characteristic of our political party , particularly when it comes to the French version of legislation , I would like the French version only of clause 17 amended to include the adjective humaine after the word dignit 茅 so that it is consistent with the English text , which speaks of human dignity .
i know there have been some objections , but I have checked in a number of international texts in which the words dignit 茅 humaine are used in French with the same meaning as the words human dignity in English .
i therefore move :
that Bill C - 22 , in Clause 17 , be amended by replacing , in the French version , line 27 on page 8 with the following :
" r 茅 putation ou la dignit 茅 humaine de tout individu ; "
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Chairman , we are in agreement .
the Chairman :
shall the amendment carry ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
( amendment agreed to )
the Chairman :
shall clause 17 , as amended , carry ?
some hon. members :
on division .
( clause 17 , as amended , agreed to )
( on Clause 19 )
Mr. Daniel Turp :
Mr. Chairman , the Bloc Quebecois does not propose any amendment regarding clause 19 , but I would like to ask a question to the minister .
it seems that , as a minimum , regulations should be made to give effect to the convention .
in fact , there is a reference to such regulations in clause 6 ( 2 ) of the implementing legislation .
i would like to know whether the minister intends to propose regulations that would complement the act and ensure full legislative and regulatory implementation of the convention and , if so , when exactly he intends to do so ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Chairman , it is a good question .
we would bring in any pertaining regulation once it is actually signed and in place .
that really would apply to the Export - Import Control Act and we would apply it but we have to have the treaty actually completed first and deposited with the secretary general before we would move toward bringing in those regulations .
Mr. Daniel Turp :
Mr. Chairman , am I to understand that the government is not in a position to have the regulations adopted before the treaty is signed and ratified by the government ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy :
Mr. Chairman , that is basically the intent .
we would have to wait for the actual signing of the treaty which will take place next week .
it will then be deposited by the prime minister with the secretary general .
we would then have to bring in the regulation which pertains directly to the Export - Import Control Act .
we will repromulgate that regulation at that point in time .
Mr. Daniel Turp :
Mr. Chairman , if I unerstand correctly , the government is not in a position to have the regulations adopted before the treaty is signed and ratified because the deadlines do not leave enough time .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy :
Mr. Chairman , it does get into somewhat of the arcane way these matters work , which I know the hon. member is well acquainted with from his academic career .
as it is , we cannot promulgate new regulations until the treaty is actually signed .
it then gives the governor in council the authority to go ahead and apply the treaty as set out in the legislation .
we cannot make that application until we have actually signed the treaty .
( clause 19 agreed to )
( on Clause 20 )
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
Mr. Chairman , our proposed amendment raises an issue which is certainly more fundamental , and the debate on the bill provides an opportunity to discuss the participation of parliament , especially of the House of Commons , in the conclusion and the implementation of treaties .
this is an important issue , since it raises the question of the role of elected representatives and of the House of Commons as a whole in the conclusion of treaties .
the treaty to be implemented was negotiated and concluded by the executive branch and it will be signed and ratified by the same , without parliamentarians and the House of Commons having truly taken part in the process .
since clause 20 sets out that this convention will be amended , and that subsequent to the amendment changes to the legislation can be made by order , it seemed worthwhile to debate the role of Parliament and to ensure that Parliament is involved in approving a treaty which would amend this new convention on anti - personnel mines , even before the Government of Canada moves to accept such an amending treaty .
we would therefore like to see this bill include parliamentary participation and a debate in Parliament before the government accepts an amendment to the treaty .
we therefore propose that this clause be amended .
this would be an amendment which might significantly the practice of treaty approval , which in Canada is totally inconsistent .
it is a practice in which the House of Commons has no significant participation , and other parliaments could serve as an example , such as the Parliament of the United Kingdom which has for some years now been more actively involved in discussion and debate around treaties which the executive plans to sign and ratify on behalf of the government .
this is therefore an opportunity to stir up debate and to find out the Minister of Foreign Affairs ' position on this question and whether he wants Parliament to be more involved in the treaty process .
i therefore move that :
that Bill C - 22 , in Clause 20 , be amended by replacing lines 18 to 24 on page 9 with the following :
" amendment to the Convention
the Chairman :
the question is on the amendment .
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Chairman , the point raised by the hon. member is an interesting point of general principle and theory .
the hon. member has raised it within the standing committee on foreign affairs of this Parliament and the standing committee has created a task force or a subcommittee which is studying the matter of general principle .
i can say without exaggeration that this is a very strong subcommittee in the sense , as has often been said , of very strong courts .
it should be considered as a matter of general principle as has already been foreseen by the standing committee on foreign affairs in creating the task force .
our suggestion to the hon. member , therefore , would be that he should withdraw the proposed amendment at this stage .
we would undertake that the general principle would be discussed by the task force .
it would always be appropriate , if and when the task force makes a recommendation , to propose amendments to the legislation and others , if and when it is adopted .
that would be our position .
in a technical sense it is constitutionally inelegant to propose a fundamental constitutional change in the law of parliament by indirection .
therefore we would suggest to the hon. member that he might withdraw the amendment .
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
Mr. Chairman , the amendment is very complex and has far - reaching impacts on this type of negotiation .
the standing committee of foreign affairs is the appropriate forum for discussion of the amendment .
we would not support the amendment today .
however we do see the potential for this type of discussion in committee and the potential for this type of change for future treaty ratification .
it is important to recognize that a lot of countries will be looking at Canada ' s legislation relative to the land mine treaty and will be adapting some of the Canadian approaches in their own countries .
we do not want to create some type of legislation that is easily bogged down in the mechanism of parliament that prevents speedy ratification for other countries .
it is similar to what happened in the U.S. , for example , with the fast track negotiating powers which had not been granted to the president and are thus inhibiting and impeding progress or U.S. ability to participate in international trade negotiation to the full extent that it would have been able to with fast track .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the Reform Party cannot support the amendment by the member for Beauharnois - Salaberry , but we certainly see the utility of having it introduced into the House of Commons for further debate and for further examination .
if the amendment were to be proceeded with right now , it would change the bill in a manner that would detract from the current activity and the current thrust of the bill .
we look forward to going ahead in the future and examining it in further detail .
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
Mr. Chairman , I want to reassure the parliamentary secretary that it was not my intention to be inelegant in proposing such an amendment and with respect to the Constitution , because these matters are far too serious for one not to be elegant .
as you noted , the intent was to raise a matter with the minister , which , it appears , arouses the interest of both the official opposition and the Conservative Party .
before considering the proposal by the parliamentary secretary , I would nevertheless ask the minister if he could give us his initial reaction to the question which this amendment raises and which other amendments could raise about the role parliament , including the House of Commons , in negotiating treaties .
i would ask for a very preliminary comment in the light of his recent experience with the treaty this legislation is attempting to implement and which this House may debate at some time other than when the legislation is implemented .
i would appreciate a comment from the minister on this question .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Chairman , I certainly find the hon. member ' s proposals interesting .
i agree with the parliamentary secretary ' s recommendation that there be an interesting exchange of viewpoints in the foreign affairs committee .
as he said , it is a general problem of replacing the representatives of the executive in the negotiation and signing of the treaty .
generally speaking , I am interested in looking at all the ways parliament is involved in foreign affairs issues especially , for example , a government decision to establish military intervention under the aegis of the United Nations and so on .
at this point , I am a keen observer of the work of the foreign affairs committee .
i will look forward to the work of the committee with considerable interest .
Mr. Daniel Turp :
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the answer .
i can see that the minister does not want to say too much at this point in time , but it would nevertheless be worthwhile to put this question to a vote to know where the various parties stand .
accordingly , I do not intend to withdraw the proposed amendment , but I will , of course , submit the question to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade , as requested by the minister .
the Chairman :
is the House ready for the question on the amendment ?
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is my understanding that the purpose of the motion moved by the hon. member for Beauharnois - Salaberry is to promote a substantive debate , and it is already clear from the somewhat short remarks we have heard how committed all the parties are , and the government in particular .
the minister himself would like to know what would come out of an in - depth review by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade .
i am wary and reluctant because , if the question is put and the amendment is negatived , then I do not think the government will repeat the offer contained in this amendment so that the issue can be looked at by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade , whose agenda is already pretty full .
but if the matter is of such importance that we would like it to be debated by the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade , I would ask for the consent of the House to withdraw this amendment and allow the committee to consider the matter in keeping with the commitment made by the minister himself .
the Speaker :
is there unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment for committee consideration ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
some hon. members :
No.
the Speaker :
there is not unanimous consent for the proposal .
is the House ready for the question on the amendment ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Chairman :
members have heard the terms of the amendment .
is it the pleasure of the committee to adopt the amendment ?
some hon. members :
No.
( amendment negatived )
( clause 20 agreed to )
( on clause 21 )
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Chairman , I have a question for the minister .
clause 21 indicates that the hybrid offence provides an opportunity for enforcement officers to determine , depending on the gravity of the offence , whether or not to proceed with a more serious instance of indictable process .
what criteria will be used to differentiate between a summary conviction and an indictable offence within the context of the bill ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Chairman , as in most cases it would be up to the prosecutor to determine what would be the criteria .
again I would not want to prejudge any able prosecutor in what they would define that to be .
i think we would leave it to the normal Criminal Code process .
Mr. Keith Martin :
Mr. Chairman , are there any precedents or examples to which the minister can speak that would show how the prosecution can decide whether or not in circumstances such as these there is a separation between summary convictions and indictable offences ?
i would like to know from the minister and his officials what separation exists .
are there examples that we can examine , or examples he can give the House today to show how the process would actually work ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy :
Mr. Chairman , it is a little difficult to give examples because this is the first time it has been done .
in other international treaties , chemical weapons conventions and others , we have not been in a position where we have had to actually use the question of principle .
the normal test would apply , which is the seriousness or the gravity of the action .
if under the act someone inadvertently provides information or sends one of the munitions abroad , not with deliberate intent to get around the legislation but inadvertently , then clearly the prosecutor has a judgment call for the lighter sentence .
however , if it is done deliberately to contravene the act for malicious purposes , if someone wants to export land mines for use in another country as part of a military arsenal , then clearly the heavier weight of that would be applied .
that would be a judgment call by whatever prosecutor was used .
they would have to weigh the gravity of the offence and use the temperate nature of our Canadian justice system to determine how it would work out .
the Chairman :
perhaps the Chair might ask if the minister has an amendment to this section .
earlier in the discussion there was some reference to the fact that there might be an amendment to section 21 .
i notice one is not forthcoming .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy :
Mr. Chairman , it goes back to the amendment that was proposed and passed under clause 11 ( 2 ) which obviates the need for this amendment .
the Chairman :
thank you .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy :
Mr. Chairman , I have been asked about the matter of the French - English translation under the clause 11 ( 2 ) amendment .
in looking at the proper interpretation , our officials were able to determine that the reference to the federal court trial division is exactly the same as the " section de premi 猫 re instance de la Cour f 茅 d 茅 rale '' .
the Chairman :
that is on clause 11 . Perhaps we could complete clause 21 first .
are there further questions or debate on clause 21 ?
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
Mr. Chairman , I believe it was on Thursday , late in the day , that I had the opportunity to meet with lawyers from the justice department .
at the time , I was told that the bill had been reviewed by the authorities to make sure it complied with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
i am now rather surprised to see an amendment to ensure such consistency .
i am also a little curious as to whether the whole bill was reviewed to make sure it is consistent with the charter , and I wonder if the government could tell us when this review was conducted by the authorities ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy :
Mr. Chairman , I thank the hon. member for his comments .
perhaps it shows the value of the ever vigilant activity of members of Parliament .
in our opening remarks we did beg the indulgence of the House .
this legislation was drafted in a two and a half week period which , if you know the system around here , is pretty fast .
we wanted to take into account all particular references to the charter .
the hon. member ' s examination last week was tough in that regard .
it was to make sure the courts would be the interpreter , not the minister .
i give the House my assurance that in our best judgment , based on the tertiary review that took place this weekend , that was the only question .
even at that , it was just that we did not want to leave any question .
we wanted to make sure it was airtight in terms of its relevance to the charter .
( clause 21 agreed to )
( on clause 22 )
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Chairman , on subclause 22 ( 2 ) , I have a question for the minister and his official .
they talk about things that have been seized in respect to the commission of an offence .
i would like a point of clarification here .
when they talk about things being seized , does that clarify subclause 22 ( 2 ) and refer to things being specifically modified for use in committing the offence which excludes property only marginally related to the offence ?
in other words , do things in subclause 21 ( 1 ) refer to things that are directly associated with the commission of the offence , for example a car that can be used to transport mines , not the person ' s home ?
also , when you are referring to the fact that the minister has the discretion as to how the things that are seized are to be disposed of , should not the courts decide how these things , as they are defined in subclause 22 ( 2 ) , be the power that decides where and how these things are supposed to be disposed ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
that is the same kind of principle that is now applied in the Criminal Code , say , on drug offences .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
in subclause 22 ( 1 ) it states that the minister has the discretion as to how the things being seized are to be disposed of .
should it not be the courts that decide how things are to be disposed of and not the minister ?
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Chairman , I should clarify just in case people did not quite understand it .
when we used the designation " minister " in the definition , it did not necessarily refer to the Minister of Foreign Affairs .
different ministers could apply .
the Minister of Foreign Affairs I can tell you would have absolutely no interest in being the operative agent in this case .
( clause 22 agreed to )
( clauses 23 to 25 , inclusive , agreed to )
( on clause 11 )
the Chairman :
we have an amendment proposed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to clause 11 .
shall the amendment carry ?
( amendment agreed to )
the Chairman :
shall clause 11 , as amended , carry ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
( clause 11 , as amended , agreed to )
( clause 1 agreed to )
the Chairman :
shall the schedule carry ?
( on the schedule )
Mr. Daniel Turp :
Mr. Chairman , I have a question .
it is not really necessary to include the convention in a schedule , as some lawyers from the justice department told me , but I think it is worthwhile to include the convention in a piece of legislation so it becomes better known .
i want to know what measures the government intends to take to publicize the treaty .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy :
Mr Chairman , first , I believe it was last week that a kit was distributed to all members of Parliament which contained information about the treaty .
i believe a copy of the treaty was included .
the treaty has also been on the website and is available for everybody to access .
we can give hon. members the website number .
i should mention we have also established a separate website to cover the conference itself .
we will be , during the course of the proceedings next week when the treaty conference is being held at the Conference Centre , organizing within the parliamentary area a special room in which members of Parliament can watch the proceedings .
we intend to bring a number of participants , ministers , NGOs and some of the children who are involved to meet the members of Parliament .
we will have our officials available to share information .
i think that portion is scheduled for next Thursday , probably after question period .
we would like to involve the the members of Parliament as much as possible .
the conference room is small in terms of the number of people who can get in .
that is why we thought we would open an ante - room here at Parliament so that members could participate and have access to the number of individuals , officials and participants who come for a special session on Thursday .
it happens from time to time that staff take our documents to read and cherish them .
furthermore , Mr. Chairman , I beg your indulgence not to use props .
we just had hand delivered this morning the logo pin for the conference .
if any member of Parliament would like to have one , I would be more than glad to distribute them when our proceedings are completed .
the Chairman :
i hear no points of order on the issue .
( schedule agreed to )
( title agreed to )
( bill reported as amended and concurred in )
the Deputy Speaker :
it is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows : the hon. member for Frontenac - M 茅 gantic , Dairy industry .
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , the minister has a commitment which will take him away from the House .
i wonder if we could seek the unanimous consent of the House to allow the minister two to three minutes maximum to say a few words without being counted as a spokesperson at third reading .
i ask for the unanimous consent of the House to allow the minister to say a few words .
the Deputy Speaker :
is that agreed ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the government whip for his intervention .
i want to use this opportunity to express my thanks to members of the Chamber for the way in which the proceedings have taken place today .
if there has been anything which has characterized this movement on land mines , it has been a sense of partnership .
no one has ownership of this .
it has been a collective effort of NGOs and private citizens , members of the cabinet , the Prime Minister and my colleagues who have taken decisions .
i think of my predecessor , Mr. Ouellet , who started the first movement with a moratorium , and decisions made by the former Minister of National Defence to eliminate land mines .
i think of members of the opposition who earlier on valiantly presented private members ' resolutions to move this House along on this matter .
there is a wide range of people who have been able to rise above many of the more immediate questions to something which has a larger horizon .
i have been in Parliament a long time as many people know and as someone said today , every once in a while we have a fine hour .
this is one of our finest hours .
i would like to thank all members for making this a day which Canadians will long remember .
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , in the same spirit of co - operation , I wonder if the House would give its consent for the following .
while in the normal course at third reading the government lead spokesperson would have 40 minutes , I propose that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the chair of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade , the hon. member for Toronto Centre - Rosedale , would each speak for 10 minutes and then we would continue the rotation as is the normal procedure of the House .
i give my undertaking that both the parliamentary secretary and the hon. member for Toronto Centre - Rosedale , the chair of the committee , will only speak for 10 minutes each .
the Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) :
is that agreed ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
Mr. Ted McWhinney ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) :
madam Speaker , I will be sharing my time as the House has already been advised with the hon. member for Toronto Centre - Rosedale .
this treaty is a significant achievement in its own right .
it continues the step by step process of building a peaceful world which began during the cold war , in its more enlightened moments , with the progressive treaties toward nuclear and general disarmament and the cessation of nuclear tests .
it should be noted however that in this treaty there has been a significant innovation and that is the involvement of people who are not normally involved in the treaty making process .
it has been a citizens ' movement in which the force of public opinion has carried the momentum to produce a treaty written off as something taking many years , but it has been completed really in 12 months with the ceremony that will take place in Ottawa in December .
we have made history in a certain sense and it will continue .
the democratization of foreign affairs and treaty making I am sure will continue because of this significant first step .
a second point I will make , which has already been commented on in this debate , is that this is a short treaty .
this is a succinct treaty and a treaty that has teeth .
it is something that goes to the gamesmanship of making treaties .
there is a way of getting treaties through a diplomatic conference by making them mellow , open ended or vacuous , whatever phrase one would like to use .
one can rally an enormous consensus but there is nothing in the treaty .
a deliberate decision was made by our government and I think by the NGOs and others participating that it was better to have a treaty that stated something even if it meant that some significant states would be absent from the treaty ' s signature and ratification .
we have pushed ahead on that basis .
in Canada treaty making and treaty ratification are the two steps necessary to give international law validity to our signature to a treaty and they are executive acts , as has been noted already .
the parliamentary process is limited to adopting the very important implementing legislation but it does not affect the validity of the treaty as international law .
however that is not true of all countries and that is why in approaching our own steps in international law making , the signature which will come formally in the next two weeks and the ratification which could be the same day , we have felt it necessary and desirable to press ahead with the treaty implementing legislation .
we want to send a message to other countries where the legislature is involved , the United States as part of its Constitution with the Senate involved , to get their act together .
if they are going to take part in the law making , then they must get their legal adhesion to the treaty completed .
if it means the signing , ratification and the legislation , get it done as quickly as possible .
it was to become law when ratified by 60 countries .
it was signed in 1982 by 102 countries but it took 14 years to get 60 of those 102 to ratify it and make it law .
i could cite the first of the big terrorist control conventions , the Tokyo convention of 1963 on aerial piracy .
that was to become law when ratified by 12 countries .
it took eight years to get 12 countries .
in our case with this treaty 40 states are necessary to ratify it to give it legal effect .
then it takes effect six months after the 40 th instrument of ratification .
we would like to complete the whole process beginning to end in a year .
that is why the momentum this Parliament is establishing with the consent of all parties is so vital .
there is another matter on which I should comment because I think we are helping consolidate law in the making .
that is to say , what is the effect ?
some people have said that we have left out some of the principal manufacturers and exporters of land mines .
some who might transfer to other countries are not bound .
is that not a treaty with gaps in it ?
let me simply say that as a matter of international law going back to the dissenting opinion of the greatest of the judges of the International Court of the post - war period , Judge Manfred Lachs , a treaty even when not ratified by a country may become binding on that country simply because of the sheer preponderance of other countries who have ratified .
that is to say , it ranks either as customary international law or it ranks in some cases as a superior form of international law , jus cogens .
i simply cite that that was an avant - garde opinion in 1969 when it was uttered in the World Court .
it is no longer avant - garde and is acquiring an increasing acceptance .
we will find that jurists in Canada will be making that argument .
if we can get 100 , 120 or 140 countries to sign and ratify , it will be somebody with great temerity who would say we could ignore the treaty provisions .
let us put it this way .
there is an educational value in signing and proclaiming acts of this sort and making them law even for those who do not sign them .
countries are very concerned about their international law image .
we are already finding this with countries we have approached to ask if they will join the treaty .
they are saying no , but maybe they can regard themselves and say that they will be bound by certain parts of it even though they do not sign and ratify the treaty as a whole .
here I simply say that the International Court of Justice in its decision in nuclear tests established a principle of law that unilateral declarations of intention to be bound by principle , law , treaty or anything else of that sort can become legally binding entities .
in fact the French government was held bound by a declaration made by its president , Giscard d ' Estaing , and its foreign minister even though perhaps at the time they did not realize the significance that was given to it .
we think there is an educational value in going ahead .
that is one of the reasons we took this risk .
we are relying on the fact that many countries or some countries who have said they cannot for national political reasons sign and ratify the treaty yet say they believe they can adopt certain parts of it .
we are going to encourage that .
this is law in the making .
therefore in a second sense the innovation made by bringing in non - governmental people and participatory democracy , we are making new international law .
i commend the adoption of this legislation to this House .
Mr. Bill Graham ( Toronto Centre - Rosedale , Lib . ) :
this treaty and this legislation we are considering today are the culmination of years of efforts of NGOs spearheaded by Jody Williams and her colleagues in the United States who appeared before our committee recently and were so ably seconded by our government , by the foreign affairs minister and by the Prime Minister .
it illustrates as other members of the House have said how we can get things done in today ' s world in spite of the complexity of today ' s world .
with determination , work and above all co - operation we can bring in results .
members of this House and humanity as a whole owe a great debt of gratitude to the countless thousands of citizens and NGOs in many countries , governments and international organizations that have worked together on this great enterprise that will culminate here in Ottawa next week .
we have heard a great deal about land mines from the minister and others .
they not only create horrible human tragedies of lives lost in ruin but they also inhibit the development of the economies of those countries .
millions of farmers are unable to continue their productive work and live in poverty because they no longer have access to their fields .
since 1975 there have been over one million casualties around the globe due to anti - personnel mines .
as the minister said , last week four members of the foreign affairs committee and four members of the defence committee visited Bosnia .
they had the opportunity of visiting with our troops and seeing firsthand the conditions created by the presence of those small objects which are so easy to put in and so costly and dangerous to remove .
they are so ingenious in their destructiveness .
they are small , some no larger than a hockey puck and are placed in the ground .
some are attached to trees and can be set off by a trip wire to go off at maximum effect at the level of a head or a chest of an innocent person passing by .
we learned of the difficulty and the danger of removing these horribly effective weapons .
we met our troops and talked with them , our troops who risk their lives and limbs on a daily basis performing the delicate and dangerous task of removing them .
we think at this time of Corporal Mark Isfeld who gave his life in 1994 in this task .
we visited the United Nations Mine Action Centre and learned that it takes 1,000 men one year to clear 10 square kilometres of mines and that at least 100 square kilometres of mines need to be cleared in Bosnia alone at minimum .
as there are only 750 present practitioners of that art , it is estimated that some 30 years or more will be required to clear that unfortunate place of the ravages of war .
we need only think of the same situation being replicated in Angola , Afghanistan , Laos and other unfortunate places on this globe .
the conditions we saw illustrated the need for other aspects of the treaty , not just a ban on these items but the need for an effective compliance regime and effective mine clearance operations financed on a global scale .
to that must be added the need for aid to the victims if humanity ' s needs are to be served .
we can take pride in the fact that Canada is contributing to all these important goals in places like Bosnia .
referring to the work of our troops , they are removing mines themselves and training others to do the job as well .
they are supporting the United Nations de - mining centre .
we are contributing through the World Bank and other financial means to the work of that and other centres throughout the world as we are contributing both on a bilateral and multilateral basis .
we are contributing to the rehabilitation of victims .
when we were in Bosnia we had the opportunity of visiting the hospital in Sarajevo .
we talked with doctors from Queen ' s University who were training other medical personnel in how to rehabilitate unfortunate victims .
we talked to CIDA experts who are doing the same .
we talked to our own troops who were in the process of helping to repaint and clean up hospitals which were damaged by war and which will serve the victims of this terrible tragedy .
we know this work is being done elsewhere throughout the world by CIDA and by other Canadian NGOs that operate courageously in far corners of the world under difficult circumstances .
the legislation will implement the treaty and ensure its terms will be enforced in Canada .
this is the second agreement of this kind that the House has had to consider recently , the first treaty being the chemical weapons convention .
we saw the need to have a universally credible means of ensuring that an agreement of this kind is put in place , is effective and is enforceable throughout many countries .
it is my belief that this is not the last time the House will be called upon to enact similar legislation .
it is my belief that in the world in which we live today we will be called upon more and more to do work of this nature to ensure the world in which we live is a safer and a saner place .
the treaty represents something in general to me as it should to members of the House .
why is Canada , a country with no land mine problem itself , spearheading what will always be known as the Ottawa process ?
Canadians believe in the need for our country to be an active participant in the global community , to make sure our values , in particular those of tolerance and compassion which have grown out of our bicultural and pluralistic society , are carried out into the world .
to this end we need to work productively with others , with other countries , international institutions , NGOs and individuals to bring people together in a common cause to better humanity .
in that sense the treaty and the legislation represent the Canadian goal .
what better example can we follow in the footsteps of Lester Pearson , John Humphrey , Dr. Norman Bethune and many other Canadians who recognize that to live in this world today we must participate fully in it ?
when we choose to do that we can achieve incredible results .
in conclusion , I would just like to offer a small comment on the nature of our work today and on what has been accomplished by this treaty .
it seems to me that this treaty and the role Canada has been able to play in its preparation , the diplomatic success it represents , is proof yet again of what Canada can achieve as a strong and united country .
i am sure that most members present will agree with me that our strength internationally and our ability to effect change in the world for the well - being of humanity as shown by this treaty gain from the fact that we are a country united from sea to sea and that we bring our collective national experience to the international scene .
this is therefore another lesson we want to draw from this experience , a lesson that will come up increasingly in the future in this heavily interdependent world , a lesson that can be of benefit to all , to the citizens of Quebec , Ontario , British Columbia and other provinces of this magnificent country .
we are taking an important step today .
let us build on it together for the benefit not only of all Canadians but of humanity as well .
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a privilege to stand before the House and speak to Bill C - 22 .
i will try to keep my remarks as brief as possible so that as many speakers as possible can speak to this important piece of legislation .
just in starting off , as the member for Rosedale said , Canadians are pleased to see that parliamentarians can take issues like this one and through co - operation come up with a solution and move it quickly through the House .
particularly in the area of foreign affairs they want to see that sort of diplomacy being demonstrated even in these premises , something we do not have a lot of , but certainly this is the opportunity for us to do that .
it is my pleasure to congratulate the minister on his co - operation and on his achievement in pushing the matter through and on to the international scene .
all this started off in the last House with one of our members putting forward legislation .
i congratulate the NGOs , Jody Williams and all the others who appeared before committee and had so much to do with the legislation .
it serves us well as Canadians that our legislation , the legislation that we are now passing in the House , will be used as an example for some of the other 40 - odd countries that have agreed to sign next week .
it will hopefully provide motivation for other countries to come on side .
i have to admit that initially I was not very familiar with what mines were all about .
we saw pink all over the map .
we saw people in some of the border towns , perhaps half of the population , who literally did not have an arm , a hand or a leg .
that brought it home for all of us as to just how serious the problem was .
we found out that under the bark of trees there could be land mines , and that land mines were not something that were sticking out so that everybody could see but were hidden .
a young child could come along and grab that tin of coke and be maimed or killed .
then one realizes just how serious the problem was and how it was something that could not be accepted by anyone in the human race .
it was pretty easy for us to say we would co - operate on the issue and that we were proud Canadians to lead an initiative that would have an impact around the world .
we have to be somewhat cautious in being too much of a boy scout when it comes to how we appear internationally .
we have to be sure that we are not just talking , that we really mean what we saying and that we really are committed to helping countries de - mine their fields , their riverbeds , their roadways and so on .
it is often easy for us to pass legislation .
i think back to when we talked about youth prostitution in foreign countries .
i cannot imagine how we would ever enforce that kind of legislation .
we feel good passing it and we agree with it but how would we enforce it ?
we have talked about the Hague convention , something a subcommittee is working on , and kidnapped kids .
all of us realize how emotional and difficult that is .
it is easy to say we are against it but it is difficult to do something about it .
i should have mentioned at the start that I will be sharing my time with the member for Calgary East .
the Deputy Speaker :
order , please .
there is a slight problem .
the House will have to give its consent to that since the hon. member has a 40 - minute slot .
some hon. members :
agreed .
Mr. Bob Mills :
Mr. Speaker , I am sorry for not mentioning that at the outset .
we have to be sure we will put ourselves into the enforcement of the legislation and continue to promote it even though it will be difficult at times .
we also have to talk about the huge problem of de - mining that exists around the world .
we have figures like 200 million or 300 million mines being out there .
the numbers are huge .
we need to help people to help themselves in that area .
our Canadian troops are doing the job by helping children to know where the mines are , to alert the authorities and to actually do something about it .
those are the kinds of commitments that do not cost a lot but are important if we are to rid the world of this serious problem .
we must understand some of the reasons some countries will not sign initially .
we heard Mr. Clinton in Vancouver yesterday say that the reason they could not give up land mines was for the protection of their own soldiers .
we may or may not agree with that reason , but we need to encourage them to come up with alternatives to the use of regular land mines .
we also have to look at renegade states and their potential use of land mines .
i am a firm believer , as I have said in this House many times , that in the 21 st century terrorism is probably going to be one of our biggest threats as citizens of this world .
of course we have to be concerned about the presence of land mines , the use of land mines and the use of different types of explosive devices .
we could talk about plutonium being sent to Canada from Russia .
we could talk about that whole area .
it is important for us to put a diplomatic and organizational pressure on the world which we are in an excellent position to do .
i think of our membership in organizations such as the Francophonie , the Commonwealth and APEC .
through those organizations we can bring a lot of pressure to bear on countries to consider signing this treaty and getting rid of land mines .
the point that we need to make in the House is that we are not just going to talk about it .
we are not simply going to pass this bill , pat ourselves on the back and move on to something else .
we have to be sure that this is an ongoing process and one which will last a long time .
i know that a number of members of the House have experienced firsthand what it means to see people living under the fear of land mines .
we in Canada are lucky .
when we come back from places like Bosnia , Cambodia or Laos we realize how lucky we are to live in this country .
our children do not have to worry about running out and playing in the field because there are no land mines .
let us never let there be land mines in this country and let us try to remove them from the world .
it is important that we broaden this to look at UN reform .
the minister made reference to this .
certainly the streamlining of the UN is something that will help us all to achieve what we want in the 21 st century .
changes within the UN are desperately needed .
we must work with the NGOs and other countries to make sure they are not so busy fighting turf wars and fighting over what they are going to do that we have this this terrible duplication of services and the terrible bureaucracy which ties up so much of what they do .
i should mention the foreign affairs committee .
many people do not know what we do in that committee .
there are several members in the Chamber who are a part of that committee , as well as others .
they cost a lot of money .
ultimately they end up being put on the shelf .
this is an example of a case where there is an issue that is real .
we can put a face on it .
it is something which people care about .
it is something that the committee can get involved in .
a lot of members have urged the government to make committees relevant .
we have urged the government to let the committees deal directly with the minister .
we want the committees to talk about the issues , be they slavery in the Sudan , the terrible problems in Nigeria and Iraq , the kidnapping of Canadian children or terrorism .
let us talk about those issues which are real to Canadians and real to members of this House for which we can , hopefully , have the same sort of conclusion as we have seen today .
that is something to work toward .
some of it will be a dream .
we have seen this sort of presentation before .
we all know about the failures which have happened .
however , it is time for us to look at what we are doing and try to make things better .
that is why it is a privilege to stand and to co - operate on the implementation of this piece of legislation .
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to speak in support of this bill today .
bill C - 22 is an important bill and I am happy to have this opportunity to share my comments with my colleagues in this House .
i would like to take a moment to express my appreciation for the tireless hours that several individuals have dedicated to this very worthwhile cause .
internationally the names of this year ' s Nobel Peace prize recipient , Jody Williams and her organization , and the efforts of the late Princess Diana brought international attention to this cause .
i applaud the Nobel Prize committee for recognizing the efforts of Jody Williams and her organization who rightfully deserve the Nobel Peace prize .
here in Canada there are many individuals and groups such as Mines Action Canada who have taken the initial momentum to work toward an international ban on land mines .
on a more personal note , I applaud my colleague for Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca who has worked tirelessly over these past several years in making this an issue on the Canadian stage .
in late 1995 he introduced a private member ' s bill that called for an international ban on the anti - personnel mines , a bill which was supported by the then Minister of Foreign Affairs .
when the current minister came into this portfolio , he too supported this initiative .
i would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of Foreign Affairs for his efforts which began the Ottawa process .
this is a proud achievement for Canada .
my congratulations go out to all Canadians who participated and made it possible to bring together over 120 countries which will be present in Ottawa next week for the signing of the treaty .
this treaty includes the banning of the use , production , stockpiling and the trade of anti - personnel land mines .
it also includes assistance for de - mining and for victims of land mines .
this was intended to be a collective disarmament treaty and has several significant humanitarian elements that will not only ban the creation of the land mines but also ban countries from using and trading them .
canada ' s exemption will allow it to import , export and possess mines for military training , mine clearing and destruction .
police officers and the RCMP will also have the authority to possess and transfer the mines in the course of their duties to defuse them .
in the event that a country falls under suspicion of violating the treaty , fact finders will be sent by the international community .
they will have the powers to search and seize them with or without warrant .
dwelling houses can be inspected with a warrant .
warrants are not required to search military bases and / or warehouse facilities .
this bill comes into effect once given royal assent and also takes effect in all provinces .
as I only have 10 minutes on this bill , I will leave most of the technical details of this legislation to those who have spoken before me as well as those who will speak after me , as I agree with most aspects of this bill .
land mines are a very serious issue in the international arena .
the use of anti - personnel mines already violates numerous tenants under international law .
each and every year it is estimated that over 250,000 individuals are at the least maimed and all too often killed by land mines .
that works out to one person every 20 minutes .
this is a tragic loss .
to make it even more tragic is that these losses are often unnecessary .
without the removal of land mines in post - war areas , many of the land mine victims have died or have been injured unnecessarily .
these land mines are currently deployed in over 70 countries , most of them developing countries .
countries such as Afghanistan , Angola , Bosnia , Cambodia , Croatia , Eritrea , Iraq , Mozambique , Somalia , Sudan and Vietnam are all affected .
there are approximately 100 million mines that are waiting for their next victim .
these losses could have been and , more importantly , should have been prevented .
land mines do not discriminate .
they will target any individual who comes into their path .
our brave peacekeepers have paid a heavy price in places like Bosnia .
these brave soldiers carry on their duties which bring honour and pride to our nation and are to be saluted for their courageous work in spite of danger to their lives .
it is interesting to note that those who manufacture or order the deployment of land mines themselves are in no danger of losing life or limb to these land mines .
it is instead the soldiers that are at risk as well as innocent civilians who ultimately are the victims of this senseless carnage .
i often wonder how many politicians or high ranking officials face danger from these land mines .
i take a personal interest in this bill .
in these countries the infrastructure development is concentrated in the urban centres .
in the countryside people walk on trails and bush paths going from village to village .
women use these trails to fetch water from rivers and from wells .
children play using these areas , running up and down these trails to meet their friends from neighbouring villages .
when unchecked , the use of these land mines interferes with a society whose primary mode of transportation in the countryside is the time honoured use of two feet .
we can , therefore , visualize what terrible deeds these land mines can do .
women , children , elderly people , soldiers all pay a heavy price for the absurdity of men who pursue political agendas .
those who manufacture such items of horror should be held as responsible as those who place those land mines .
it is only fitting .
therefore , we can move forward and stop manufacturing land mines .
there are real economic costs to the production and removal of land mines is estimated at 2 million land mines being deployed every year .
it is estimated that approximately 100,000 mines are removed each year at a cost of approximately $ 300 to $ 1,000 each .
with these figures there is an estimated cost of approximately $ 50 billion .
although this figure is enormous , I would argue that this would not compare to the loss of life .
it is believed that for every mine removed another 20 are planted .
at the current rate of de - mining , if more land mines were to be placed it would take over 1,000 years to rid the world of these dangerous killers .
getting rid of these mines is not going to be easy .
besides the sheer time involved in finding these mines , as most mine fields are not mapped out , de - mining is a very dangerous job .
it is believed that for every 5,000 mines removed , one person will be killed and another two will suffer injuries .
i could go on and on and read a whole list of statistics and figures , but that does not bring the real issue to the forefront .
this is not a financial issue , but an issue of our core moral values .
the contribution that those who were maimed or killed would have made to our society would have far outweighed the so - called economic loss of getting rid of these land mines .
to put it more simply and bluntly , one cannot put a price tag on life .
we all have to move forward to ensure that this senseless killing of innocent civilians and soldiers stops .
i would like to note that several key nation states have not yet signed this treaty and I hope they overcome their differences and sign on as well .
for the most part these countries are citing security reasons for using the mines .
yet often the use of these mines is as destructive for the armies that have set up the mines as for the enemies .
we now live in a global village .
we are members of one gigantic family .
our efforts should be devoted to promoting harmony and peaceful coexistence .
all religions of the world espouse neighbourly love .
wars are destructive , causing loss of precious human life , breaking up families , causing pain .
however , we have a long way to go before we can peacefully coexist .
this treaty is the first step toward achieving that goal and it receives my full unconditional support .
in conclusion , I would like to say that while I stand proudly in supporting this bill , I also feel and share the pain of those who were the victims of land mines .
to them I say while we may have been late and have let them down , our prayers are that our present and future generations will not suffer the same pain that they have suffered .
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I wish to inform you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague , the member for Laval East .
the Deputy Speaker :
as I indicated during the speech by the hon. member for Red Deer , since the hon. member had 40 minutes at his disposal , the consent of the House is required for him to divide his time with another member .
is there unanimous consent ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
Mr. Daniel Turp :
Mr. Speaker , the first time I heard about the convention and anti - personnel mines was when I was having discussions with colleagues at the Universit 茅 libre in Brussels .
professors and students in international law were calling for the elimination of these " instruments of death '' , as they were already calling them at the beginning of this decade .
this is an issue that I became involved in , as did everyone who was calling for disarmament , everyone who was following , in Vienna and elsewhere , the conferences organized to bring the international community to abandon the instruments of death such as nuclear arms , smaller arms , mines of all types and especially anti - personnel mines .
however , I still had not seen personally what these instruments of death were until I went with my colleagues in this House to Bosnia - Hercegovina several weeks ago , where we were briefed on several occasions on these mines , on how they operate , on the way they kill and the way they endanger human life .
it was a rather moving experience and one that showed how important it was to support the international community ' s objective of banning the production and use of these mines .
these facts helped me convince the members of our party , the Bloc Quebecois , to support the initiative of the Minister of External Affairs and to ensure that our party would give its support to the convention as it is outlined today in the Canadian legislation .
increased awareness of this in Canada and abroad issue must not , however , lead us to forget that this convention is an unfinished creation and will undoubtedly remain so .
the debate we witnessed today in this House reveals how much we live in a system where democracy has its failings when it comes to signing such a convention and implementing it in domestic law .
i would like to take a few minutes to discuss each of these issues .
but there are 191 countries in the international community and at least 70 states will not be there , 70 states that have not yet committed to eliminating these mines .
and also the states who will be signing the convention will have to become parties to this convention and to ensure that their legislature or their government will ratify or endorse it .
among the states that are still hesitating to support this convention , there are three members of the Security Council , that is the United States , Russia and China , which are some of the most powerful nations in the world and which refuse to come to Ottawa or buy into the Ottawa process .
therefore , this work is unfinished and it might remain unfinished .
in that sense , the work accomplished by the Minister of Foreign Affairs is only beginning and the work of all those who supported him , including the work that is being done in this House , must continue .
the Bloc Quebecois will support the initiatives taken to ensure that this convention will have an increasing impact on the international community .
however , the debate today helped illustrate how parliament and parliamentarians lack a proper voice , I would say an adequate voice , in the process by which treaties are adopted , the process by which treaties are developed and create obligations that are very important and that often entail legislation , as with this treaty , by which treaty obligations can be implemented .
we presented this afternoon an amendment which sought to determine to what extent the government was willing to commit itself to a democratization of the process by which treaties are concluded .
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of External Affairs was speaking earlier of the democratization of external relations that had been witnessed by the international community with the adoption of this treaty , which involves not only governments but also non - government organizations , which of course work in partnership with international bodies .
it is time to also democratize the process by which states participate in international negotiations and in the conclusion of international treaties .
in conclusion , this treaty and this act will be a source of pride for the international community next week .
it is true that the Minister of Foreign Affairs has shared with his colleagues , and with those in this House , the glory involved in getting this convention signed , but it is the international community that will benefit from it .
it is the men , women and children of the world who will be the main beneficiaries , for their basic rights , the most fundamental one being the right to life , will be better protected by this convention .
humanity will be the beneficiary of this convention , a humanity composed of the men and women whom states and nations have a duty to protect at all times , including when treaties are signed .
i would like to use the words of a great internationalist , one that Professor Jacques - Yvan Morin , an academic colleague of mine and a professor of international law known in political circles , having been a minister and deputy premier in Quebec , has a predilection for quoting .
Mrs. Maud Debien ( Laval East , BQ ) :
Mr Speaker , I would like to say right off that I rise to speak with great interest on Bill C - 22 , which concerns the implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use , Stockpiling , Production and Transfer of Anti - Personnel Mines and on their Destruction .
i do so as well with considerable compassion for those , often innocent individuals , whom death has claimed or whose quality of life has been significantly reduced through the explosion of a mine .
there is another important element to this too , that of de - mining and the effort expended by the international community in this regard .
one fact remains , and it represents an important step .
in a few days , in Ottawa , we will witness the signing of the convention prohibiting anti - personnel mines .
unfortunately , this treaty will not resolve the problem once and for all , because certain major countries will not be signatories .
it will , however , help to limit the terrible effects .
the Bloc Quebecois recognizes the leadership of the Government of Canada and its Minister of Foreign Affairs in this matter along with the efforts of the public and the NGOs .
i will now give some background on anti - personnel mines .
these mines are cheap weapons .
each costs somewhere between US $ 3 and US $ 50 and has as its sole purpose the mutilation of the enemy .
despite its low purchase cost , this is a pernicious weapon that continues its destruction long beyond the end of wars and conflicts , as we will see .
inexpensive , easily produced and effective , these weapons were used in a good many conflicts .
it will be recalled that the war between India and Pakistan , the war between Iraq and Iran , the Gulf War and the domestic conflicts in Cambodia and Angola demonstrated the destructive power of anti - personnel mines .
first used as defensive weapons in international conflicts , they formed a protective barrier essentially designed to slow enemy progress .
that is what mine fields were used for originally .
however , the use of such mines was expanded .
today they are used in domestic conflicts and in civil wars , they are used by police forces as well as by insurgent , guerrilla and paramilitary groups .
the saddest thing about all this is that some governments use these mines against their own population .
in Kurdistan , the Iraqi government is said to have mined the fields of several villages , to terrorize the villagers into submission .
anti - personnel mines thus become tools to control population movements and to create fear within the population , the main goal being , sadly , to kill and maim civilians .
as we can see , the use of anti - personnel mines has many very serious consequences .
anti - personnel mines make no discrimination between men , women and children , innocent victims of cruel wars taking place in their country .
those mines that are left behind cause human tragedies of untold sadness .
most of the time , mine victims who are not killed lose a limb .
however , let us remember that countries having to deal with anti - personnel mines are almost all developing countries , poor countries that cannot provide adequate care to the injured because of a lack of human and financial resources .
these heavily handicapped victims are unable to participate in the local economy , to work to provide for their families .
and what about the economic tragedies caused by anti - personnel mines ?
in some countries , farmers are unable to cultivate their lands or to put their cattle out to pasture because their fields are mine - ridden .
we have seen previously self - sufficient farming areas that now depend on external food aid .
for example , it is estimated that in some areas of Angola anti - personnel mines have reduced food production by more than 25 % .
furthermore , it is quite often impossible to deliver food , because truck drivers will not venture out on roads that are strewn with mines .
at the same time , besides causing terror , mines prevent post - war reconstruction by interfering with the work of humanitarian organizations and peacekeeping forces .
however , if there is something horrifying and unacceptable when it comes to anti - personnel mines , it is the physical and psychological harm done to the children who are the victims of these barbaric weapons .
the images of innocent children horribly burned by napalm caused universal consternation .
the effects of anti - personnel mines are every bit as devastating .
for this reason , and it is not the only one , as we have seen , governments that have signed this convention must pursue their persuasive efforts with non - signatory governments .
as I said earlier , however , the problems caused by anti - personnel mines will not disappear overnight with the signing of this convention .
their impact will be greatly diminished , it is true .
the issue of mine clearing will , however , remain intact .
worse yet , for every mine removed from the ground , 20 new mines are being laid at the present time .
at this rate , it is estimated that it would take 1,100 years and over $ 30 billion to completely eliminate the anti - personnel mines now scattered throughout the world .
it is therefore imperative that mine clearing be approached effectively and with tools as modern as those used to lay them .
we know , however , that mine clearing is an expensive operation .
in 1994 , the UN spent $ 70 million US to clear fewer than 100,000 mines .
as a matter of fact , it costs between $ 300 and $ 1,000 to remove a single mine .
the international community can claim that it does not have the resources necessary to remove all mines .
the fact is , however , that , in the 1980 s , exports of heavy and of light arms to third world countries represented 70 % of the world trade of rich countries .
there is an obvious international responsibility here with respect to countries that have become poor to the advantage of rich countries and arms lobbies .
but , despite a large drop in heavy arms exports to developing countries , we have been seeing a worrisome proliferation of light arms in the 1990 s .
an analysis reveals , and I quote " From 1980 to 1995 , ten African nations with a total population of 155 million were torn apart by civil wars .
between 3.8 and 6.9 million people , or 2.5 to 4.5 % of the population of these ten countries , died , almost all of them killed by light weapons .
it seems that the leaders of western nations are increasingly preoccupied by arms stockpiling in third world trouble spots , in the very areas to which they are being called to send ceasefire monitoring groups .
an awareness seems to be emerging from this fundamental contradiction : on the one hand , rich nations are trying to end conflicts while , on the other , they are continuing to supply arms to belligerent nations '' .
history is repeating itself .
here again , action must be taken and solutions do exist .
this is why the successful implementation of the Anti - Personnel Mines Convention is very encouraging and gives us hope that a multilateral agreement on light weapons can be reached .
in conclusion , the Bloc Quebecois reaffirms its support to Bill C - 22 .
the Ottawa process has become essential .
however , as I said previously , we still have a long way to go .
at first , our purpose was to deal with tanks and other armoured vehicles , but now we want to protect the civilians whose lives are threatened by these anti - personnel mines , the people who have suffered the most from war .
the signing of the Anti - Personnel Mines Convention , next December 3 , will hopefully reduce the number of these human tragedies .
however , de - mining remains a sensitive issue that the world community has yet to address seriously .
that is the price we have to pay to give some meaning to the words justice and fairness .
it is also the price we have to pay for peace and security .
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
there have been discussions among representatives of all the parties for the following motion , and I would ask that you seek unanimous consent of the House for the following .
an hon. member :
oh , oh .
the Deputy Speaker :
perhaps I could hear the proposal of the chief government whip .
Mr. Bob Kilger :
Mr. Speaker , it is not my intention in any way , shape or form to deny anyone the opportunity to speak on this very important matter .
as can be witnessed by the number of members in the House today , this subject matter is one that many members want to speak to .
in that same spirit I move :
that at the end of this day ' s debate on third reading of Bill C - 22 , the question shall be deemed put and adopted unanimously .
the Deputy Speaker :
does the chief government whip has the unanimous consent of the House to present the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Deputy Speaker :
the House has heard the terms of the motion .
is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
the Deputy Speaker :
motion carried .
earlier this day I informed the House of proceedings on the adjournment motion to be held this evening .
it is with profound regret that I advise the House that those proceedings have been cancelled .
accordingly , we will continue with the debate before the House .
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill ( Bras d ' Or , NDP ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a great honour for me to stand on behalf of the New Democratic Party to speak in support of our country ' s initiative to ban land mines .
this treaty is a testament to the power that people can have when they act together and to the positive power that governments can have when they put their minds to it .
just one year ago most nations of the world decided that even though the economic costs were large and the military implications larger , this issue is a moral one .
anti - personnel land mines are an evil which has no place in the arsenal of modern democracy .
in Canada we are blessed with thousands of kilometres of open space .
perhaps I feel strongly about this treaty because I am the mother of a young daughter .
i read about the scores of children like her who are killed or maimed every day by mines .
i read about mines made with brightly coloured plastic or cloth designed to attract children , designed to kill children .
designs like these have no place in the world I want for my daughter .
in Canada and other first world countries we spend a lot of time talking about rights and duties and codes of acceptable behaviour .
at the same time we have allowed our governments to manufacture and export land mines , weapons whose only purpose is to cripple and to maim .
that is the worst sort of hypocrisy .
since 1868 and the St. Petersburg declaration which outlawed weapons which uselessly aggravate suffering , through to the Geneva convention which banned the use of terror against non - combatants , governments have worked long and hard to make sure that human lives are spared the painful excesses of modern military technology .
but they have worked simultaneously to advance that technology , to make it possible to develop devices like the gravel mine I talked about a minute ago , a mine that includes the following line in its owners manual : " They are especially effective against inquisitive children .
they make life difficult for rural communities without endangering troops and armoured vehicles '' .
how about the wide area anti - personnel mine .
these are dropped from aircraft and throw out eight fine threads which then act as trip wires .
anyone who steps on any of the trip wires sets off the mines and lethal pellets scatter over an area of 60 metres .
mines have been filled with flechettes , small and irregularly shaped scraps that embed themselves deep in the victim ' s flesh .
a recent innovation has been to tip the pellets with depleted uranium so victims will also suffer from radiation poisoning .
this is what the governments of the world have been working on in their labs while the leaders preach peace and compassion .
this treaty is a huge step forward , a step on to safer ground .
we are not free from danger yet .
until the superpowers have the courage to sign this treaty and the United States has the courage to accept the ban wholeheartedly , we know that every day for decades to come more lives will be shattered by mines .
every year in Europe a few mines left over from the second world war explode , killing yet more people .
that war ended over 50 years ago .
since then more mines have been laid than ever .
countries like Afghanistan , Vietnam , Cambodia , Angola and Bosnia are carpeted with bombs that will take decades to clear .
during those decades more families were broken .
this is a fact and one we cannot escape , but we can reflect on it and do our best to make sure the cycle of violence and death is broken .
the United Nations has done excellent work co - ordinating mine clearing projects around the world but that work is useless unless we , members of the governments of the world , promise to ourselves and our children that we will stop adding to the stockpile .
making that promise means more than speeches in the House of Commons .
it means applying the full moral weight of our nation to those countries that still insist land mines are a vital part of their defences .
it is ironic that today the leaders of the APEC nations are gathered in Vancouver hosted by our Prime Minister .
the leaders of China and the United States both have refused to sign this treaty .
yesterday U.S. President Bill Clinton at least had the courage to congratulate Canada and urged us to move forward with the treaty .
meanwhile the Chinese government , which is responsible for a large percentage of the global manufacture and export of mines , has refused to sign the treaty and even to discuss signing the treaty .
it is truly a positive step for this Liberal government to have initiated this treaty .
i want to extend sincere thanks from the NDP caucus to our Minister of Foreign Affairs for his diligent work to make this treaty a reality .
it shows what governments can do when they decide to make a positive difference .
my only regret is that it often seems the minister is a lone voice in this administration pushing for a more moral and humane approach to foreign affairs .
while he pressures the Chinese and tries to take them to task for their refusal to meet the standards of international decency , other government leaders are wining and dining the Chinese president in Vancouver .
i am just one person whose voice has joined the global chorus calling for the abolition of land mines .
there are tens of thousands of others , including the winners of this year ' s Nobel peace prize and many other individuals , groups and governments .
for them banning land mines is part of the moral philosophy of social democracy just as it is for us in the NDP caucus .
it is part and parcel of our belief in human dignity and international co - operation .
this issue has to be put in a larger context .
land mines are an obvious and unquestionably evil expression of man ' s inhumanity to man , but there are others just as evil that receive little or no attention from the world ' s leaders .
to be brutal , why ban land mines if there are no hospitals to treat children with measles ?
why replace death from shrapnel wounds with death from malaria , with death from cold or hunger ?
this treaty must be a first step , but the fact that I can rise in this House to discuss the issue that our government has been the author of a civilized page in the global book of laws remains a credit to this government .
we are creating a new law for the civilized countries of the world and that is a worthy thing .
on behalf of the people of my riding , of my party and for myself and my daughter Kayla , I thank all the people who made this treaty a reality .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I remind the hon. member that there were others involved in the land mines process .
mines Action Canada , a conglomeration of non - governmental organizations , has done an outstanding job of bringing this issue forward .
members of the public have been bringing the issue forward for the past four years .
i also wanted to correct the member on another point .
Belgium was one of the first countries in the world to take the initiative of unilaterally destroying its mines .
it banned mines before the issue ever came to the forefront .
i would like to set the record straight on that point .
if the member wants to correct her speech to that effect , I am sure she is free to do so .
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the hon. member for his comments .
as we all know , our time for speaking is very limited .
i could have continued on a lot longer to mention the things which he just talked about .
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , my comments will be brief today but extraordinarily meaningful .
i will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Compton - Stanstead .
these are challenging times for a middle power .
in a post cold war environment there has been a sharp decline in the role of the nation state in terms of its ability to meaningfully impact foreign policy and international policy .
there has been a commensurate increase in the power and strength of NGOs , multinational corporations and in fact in individuals .
this treaty is an example of how government can recognize the changing times and harness the new power of NGOs to create meaningful foreign policy amidst the challenges of a new environment .
another trend in a post cold war environment is the entrance of a new phrase , a new term , and that is human security .
human security is being used increasingly in place of national security in a growing foreign policy circle .
human security recognizes that since the end of the cold war most conflicts have been interstate conflicts .
the majority of those interstate conflicts have been between governments and their own people .
it is in that environment we must recognize we need to protect the security and the safety of individuals .
hence human security is increasingly becoming as important as national security .
this land mine treaty recognizes this trend as well and serves to strengthen human security for all citizens of the world .
canada must continue to play a vigilant role in utilizing all levers at our disposal , including the World Bank and the IMF , to pressure non - signatories to come on board and support this treaty .
we must also ensure that the financial resources are made available to assist countries in complying with the conditions of this treaty .
canada ' s leadership role in the Ottawa process stands as an example of what we can achieve .
it also stands as an example of what we must continue to do , which is that we must continue to play a strong role as a middle power in a post cold war environment .
we can and must continue in the tradition of Lester Pearson and in the tradition of Joe Clark to play a pivotal role in foreign policy , in foreign affairs , and to protect the rights , security and safety of all peoples .
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will also be very brief .
i have a couple of comments to make with respect to the speeches which have been made by hon. members today .
Jody Williams was mentioned several times .
i attended a breakfast for her a couple of weeks ago , as did many hon. members .
when she was questioned on what she would be doing for her next project , she was quite clear that she had nowhere near finished her project on land mines .
she said that she would be continuing with that project .
right now we have the opportunity to take this issue one step further , which is the type of thing she would like to do .
the Asia - Pacific economic co - operation meeting is taking place in Vancouver .
i understand that the APEC meeting will not address human rights concerns , that it will only address economies .
that is not the right thing to do .
i know that many Canadians and the minister feel that this is not the right thing to do .
the human rights records of our trading partners should be mentioned and not just in passing .
similarly , APEC provides an excellent opportunity to discuss security matters .
the Pacific Rim is becoming more volatile as communist China grows stronger and North Korea becomes more and more unpredictable .
in the future APEC will address international security concerns in the region .
it will soon not be able to ignore the issue .
it would be a wonderful start to set an important precedent if Canada led this initiative .
it is my suggestion that Canada bring up the issue of the land mines treaty fully and publicly and not just in bilateral meetings .
if the government is really serious about ridding the world of land mines , the APEC summit would be a timely opportunity to challenge countries to join .
again , I want to congratulate the government and particularly the Minister of Foreign Affairs for his efforts .
Mr. David Pratt ( Nepean - Carleton , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Burlington .
i am very pleased to be able to speak on this legislation before the House today .
it will enable Canada to fulfil its obligations under the international convention banning land mines .
as members of this House know , over 100 countries will come to Ottawa on December 3 to participate at the Treaty Signing Conference and Mine Action Forum .
this event will bring to a close the Ottawa process which was initiated last year by the Minister of Foreign Affairs after the United Nations sponsored conference on disarmament talks in Geneva bogged down .
this legislation , which is entitled the anti - personnel mines convention implementation act , is of course necessary in order to give the full force of law to Canada ' s political and diplomatic obligations as a signatory to the convention .
i certainly hope that other signatories to the treaty act with the same speed and resolve that we in this Parliament have demonstrated in ratifying this treaty .
on behalf of the residents of my riding of Nepean - Carleton , I would also like to once again offer my personal congratulations to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the tremendous personal effort he put into this initiative .
great credit is of course also due to the hundreds of NGOs , international organizations led by American activist Jody Williams and supported by others like the late Diana , Princess of Wales .
together a very important humanitarian goal has been achieved .
we have all heard about the statistics on land mines .
there are an estimated 100 million mines in the ground in 70 countries around the globe .
every 20 minutes a person is maimed or killed by an anti - personnel mine .
for every mine taken out of the ground , 20 new mines are planted .
fully 80 % of the casualties are innocent civilians , a large portion are children and women .
they live in countries like Afghanistan , Cambodia , Mozambique , Somalia and Vietnam .
on the North American continent we are very fortunate indeed not to have to live with the constant threat of land mines as we go about our daily lives .
others are not so lucky .
seven years ago I travelled to Zimbabwe in southern Africa as part of a CIDA sponsored delegation .
one aspect of our visit involved a trip to a refugee camp on the Mozambique border called Tongagora .
what I saw there in three and a half hours left me with an unforgettable image of what life is like for many people less fortunate than we are .
for over 40,000 refugees from the war in Mozambique , many attempting to overcome the effects of malnutrition , malaria and diarrhoea and other diseases , this camp was their home .
the sight of one child in particular seared an image on my brain which I will never forget .
like all the children in the camp , this young fellow was clothed in rags .
he was probably about 11 or 12 years old and walked with a makeshift crutch to support himself because one of his legs was amputated at the knee .
one - half of his jaw on the right side looked as if it had been blown away .
when I looked at that child from a comfortable seat on a bus as we were leaving the camp , the only thing I could think of was the fact that he would never enjoy the life that so many of us in this country are blessed with .
starting life as a refugee is bad enough but having to cope with amputated limbs and serious disfigurement takes an extremely bad situation and makes it dramatically worse .
whether he suffered his injuries from a land mine is something I will never know , but it is clear that the land mines were responsible for many of the amputated limbs at that camp .
every time I see that young boy ' s face in my mind ' s eye , I think of the land mines and the incalculable damage done to innocents .
as unfortunate as that boy was , many land mine victims in Mozambique never made it to a refugee camp .
some simply could not make the long journey to safety and others bled to death at or close to the land mine that they had detonated .
the effect of land mines goes beyond the physical damage that is done .
also of concern is the profound psychological damage that accompanies living with land mines .
a series of letters which appeared in last Saturday ' s Globe and Mail from young Bosnians about the menace of land mines speaks eloquently of their effect on young minds .
one young man , Admir Mujkic , a grade 12 student in east Tuzla wrote " Spring will come soon .
warm nights full of temptation to go out for a walk .
we have had enough of smoke filled cafes , but where to go .
mines are all around us .
our fields , meadows , forests are probably covered with mines .
that could probably ruin my life or somebody else ' s life , youth , beliefs , love .
i want to run through flowery fields with my girlfriend .
i want to pick the first violet for her , to climb the trees and forests .
i want to lie in the grass and watch the sky for hours .
i want to dream '' .
another student , Melisa Dzanovica , in grade 7 and also from Tuzla , wrote " My friend , do not look at the sky , do not count the stars , do not look at the yellow moon because in a split second it can become bloody .
it takes only one wrong step .
so lower your head , my friend .
your enemy is in the earth .
it has surrounded you with a thick wire .
there are a number of challenges we face in connection with this treaty .
one is to ensure that ratification by the signatories proceeds quickly so that this treaty can become part of international law that stems the manufacture , possession , use and export of land mines .
as parliamentarians we must work with our counterparts in other countries to ensure that this happens quickly .
another challenge is to bring those who will not be signing the treaty , in particular our friends to the south , on as signatories .
this would be a major step forward .
it is indeed unfortunate that the United States has decided not to become a signatory to the treaty at this time .
as we know , it has cited its defensive situation in South Korea as its rationale for not signing , even though at least one of its own generals , General Norman Schwarzkopf , has said that the United States does not need land mines to defend itself or its allies .
to give credit where credit is due , however , the U.S. has destroyed 1.5 million land mines and has promised to destroy another 1.5 million in the short term .
it has also vowed to increase its already sizeable budget for de - mining operations by 25 % next year .
this brings me to perhaps the most important challenge that we now face as a global community ; that is to move beyond the treaty signing and ratification to the next phase which should be a concerted international effort to get these mines out of the ground .
this next phase will make the Ottawa process seem easy by comparison .
it will require political will , significant resources as well as up to date technology to ensure that more lives are not lost and more injuries sustained in the de - mining effort .
as Canada has led the Ottawa process and the anti - personnel land mines treaty , so should we lead the process of ridding the world of these horrible weapons .
we have some of the best trained personnel in land mine removal among the members of our armed forces and we have some of the most up to date technology .
in the case of Computing Devices of Canada , they are working on a system which combines a variety of land mine detection technologies in one package .
their particular technology will have a system to detect even small amounts of metal .
with ground penetrating radar their system will detect the presence of foreign objects in the soil .
with an infrared camera it will detect heat flow disturbances in the soil associated with buried land mines .
yet another sensor is capable of detecting nitrogen , a key component of explosives .
the Thomson - CSF technology involves a very sophisticated robotic system with the capability of digging up , removing and disposing of land mines .
i mention this to indicate that the task of ridding the world of over 100 million land mines is a tremendously difficult but not an impossible task .
great strides are being made with technology which will significantly reduce injuries and deaths related to de - mining activities .
to conclude , I want to say that all Canadians should be proud of this tremendous diplomatic achievement by the minister and the many others who are responsible for having this treaty moved forward .
i am confident that with the political determination , the financial resources and the latest technologies Canada can once again take the lead in one of the most important humanitarian issues of our time .
Ms. Paddy Torsney ( Burlington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I too am pleased and honoured to be able to rise today in support of Bill C - 22 .
i am particularly pleased but not at all surprised that this bill has received support from all parties in this House .
we do not agree often , but on this issue we do because we stand first as Canadians and stand for peace in the world .
i was honoured along with my colleagues from Brossard - LaPrairie and from Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca to participate with the minister at the Oslo conference in Norway this September as the treaty was being negotiated and at the forum for the non - governmental organizations with the people who have been driving this issue for years and years .
the Canadian delegation performed admirably .
their action , their commitment , their perseverance in Oslo was second to none and as a result , countries from around the world look to Canada for leadership on this issue .
in fact , with the passing of this bill , we will be in a position to be the first country to ratify the treaty to ban land mines .
this , coupled with our recent destruction of our last operational land mine , signifies the level of our commitment to ensuring that land mines are destroyed and lives will be saved .
during this debate we heard the member for Nepean - Carleton talk a great deal about the impact of active land mines and what he has witnessed and the important role Canada has played in bringing this issue to its present place .
we all have a vested interest in this House and across the nation in ensuring that the world is de - mined .
i thought I would focus my comments , therefore , on why Canadians are working so hard and at such a speed to impose this world - wide ban .
what are the next steps ?
this is a bill about peace and international security .
it is a bill about taking steps to protect people ' s land , allowing people to provide safely for their families .
for too long people in a number of countries have starved while their rice paddies and fields lay empty for fear of the consequences of entering those areas .
most important , this bill is about people .
it is about saving lives .
it is about preventing senseless deaths and it is about restoring hope to communities .
others will take weeks to die .
physically , we have already heard it is a tremendous injury on the individuals and medical care is not always accessible .
they can no longer manoeuvre in the rice paddies , go out and work on the farms .
the effect for young women on their marriageability is rather drastic .
if they should be so fortunate to get married , often there are later complications in childbirth .
there are many obstacles along that road .
of course , as the member for Nepean - Carleton has mentioned already , emotionally it has a devastating impact on children and adults who are injured .
the social reintegration of the individuals is absolutely important .
these are innocent victims .
they are women working in their fields supporting their families , children playing freely or gathering firewood .
on December 4 when delegates return to their respective countries and heads of state leave with their official copy of the treaty , our work will just be beginning .
colleagues , we must really focus on our work at that point and we must work in earnest .
the signing of this treaty is only the first step .
we must sustain political and public attention on the issue .
we must continue to encourage non - signatory countries to sign , otherwise there will still be countries that can buy land mines , transfer land mines , stockpile land mines and they will wreak havoc on our world .
we have the momentum .
there is a lot we can do with this energy .
this treaty is a fantastic example of diplomacy , of what can be achieved when governments listen to the people and then act , and of what can be attained when individuals and groups work together relentlessly and of what our country , Canada , as a middle power , as a peaceful nation , is capable of advancing in this century and in the next .
i would like to add my congratulations to those of all members of the House of Commons to the individuals who have been involved in this historic treaty , especially to the member for Brant for her initiative and for helping to focus me several years ago on this issue , and to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for his insight , perseverance , commitment and energy .
he took a risk last year and has followed through and worked doggedly on this .
on December 2 , 3 and 4 , the world will be watching as we take this important humanitarian step and lead the world into a new phase of disarmament .
there are more issues that we can tackle in this progressive new way to deal with things .
on December 4 , evil will be defeated , good will triumph and people around the world can be joyous that we will finally be on the progressive side of dealing with this deadly , indiscriminate weapon .
they will know that finally one day we will see that end , we will see when mines are removed from our land .
my colleague has identified opportunities for Canadians to participate in that process .
we can know that without mines being used in such a terrible fashion that our peacekeepers , who are trying to help in various nations around the world , will have a better chance and will be a little safer .
this has been a terrific debate and I am proud to have been a part of it .
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I shall be sharing my time with the hon. member for Souris - Moose Mountain .
the good people of Surrey Central are very happy to have me speak on their behalf in support of this legislation to implement the convention on the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of anti - personnel mines and their destruction .
my constituents and I would like to salute and pay special tribute to my Reform Party colleague , the hon. member for Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , who not only attended the convention at Oslo , but who has many years experience working as a medical doctor in the mine infested area of Mozambique .
in fact , in 1995 and 1996 he was the Reform member of Parliament who introduced a private members ' bill calling for an international ban on anti - personnel mines , but the government refused to make the bill votable .
if that bill had been declared votable , the treaty could have been signed much earlier , perhaps over two years earlier , and we could have saved many lives around the world .
the new Liberal Minister of Foreign Affairs also supported the anti - personnel land mines initiative .
canada began pursuing the matter with other countries in the world , hoping to get a consensus on an international ban .
the international non - government organization community has always argued that a ban on land mines is necessary because the mines actually violate international human rights and international law by killing or maiming over 20,000 civilians per year .
a draft treaty was produced in Oslo , Norway , in September 1997 .
included in this treaty was the banning of the use , production , stockpiling and trade of anti - personnel mines , but it also included assistance for de - mining and for the victims .
next month there will be a formal signing ceremony in Ottawa .
the treaty is supported by the Canadian Armed Forces .
in fact there is ample military evidence to support the ban of anti - personnel mines .
the Oslo treaty is intended to be a collective international disarmament treaty .
the bill we are debating today is the product of the Oslo draft treaty .
bill C - 22 has many significant humanitarian elements that will not only ban countries from producing land mines but will ban countries from using and trading them .
canada ' s exemptions to this treaty will allow us to import , export and possess land mines only for military training , mine clearing and destruction .
peace officers and RCMP officers will also have the authority to possess and transport land mines in the course of their duties to diffuse them .
the bill has 14 sections .
i would briefly like to describe a few of the sections which are important .
there are prohibitions as we know .
under the bill it is illegal to place a mine under , on or near the ground or any surface area .
it is also illegal to develop , to produce or to stockpile mines directly or indirectly except for training purposes , to dismantle , or for display in museums .
it is also illegal to import or export anti - personnel mines .
there is a destruction of mines section .
individuals who are in possession of anti - personnel mines must deliver them to specific locations for immediate destruction with the exception of the military , RCMP or those authorized by the minister to render the mines useless .
there are inspection rules .
in the event that a country is accused of violating this treaty , the foreign minister of that country must provide to members of the United Nations fact finding team a certificate that will allow members of the mission to inspect areas where there is suspicion of mines , that is military bases or industrial warehouses .
this power is only extended to commercial dwellings .
they cannot enter into private dwellings unless the owner allows them .
summary convictions range from a fine of $ 5,000 , jail time of up to 18 months , or both .
convictions on indictment range from a fine of $ 500,000 or imprisonment for a term no longer than five years , or both .
the United States and China have refused to be signatories to this treaty .
however they have both implemented many significant aspects of the treaty such as the destruction of their stockpiles of mines .
also they have not exported mines for some years .
we hope that in times to come China and the United States will sign the treaty .
the U.S.A. has done more than any other country in terms of committing more money to de - mining .
it has made sure that the anti - tank weapons are not anti - personnel any more .
it has destroyed a record number of mines already .
the U.S. was the first nation to ask the United Nations to call for a ban on anti - personnel mines .
the U.S. expects to lead in the role of peacekeeper in many parts of the world and expects to be accommodated , but in Oslo the nations did not agree .
we know that last week the U.S. lost a plane and its crew off the coast of Africa while en route to de - mining activities in Africa .
countries in war zones such as Bosnia , Turkey , middle eastern countries , India and Pakistan have not signed on either .
even though these nations have not become signatories , the fact that a treaty with teeth has been produced is more successful than a treaty that is agreed to by everyone but has enough loopholes to make it worthless .
with respect to the bill in its current form one of the issues that causes concern is the lack of specifics concerning who will be assigned by the minister to be the watch dog over the destruction of any mines and the enforcement of the law within Canada .
another issue is the request for assistance .
a commitment for assistance with no fixed moneys is stated in the treaty .
this is assistance that can be given where appropriate and affordable .
let us imagine the civilian human aspect for a moment .
history shows that mines do not stop armies but stop people ' s lives completely .
in certain villages mines are all around in the fields , meadows and forests .
the schools are covered with posters asking kids to think mines .
they are being told not to look at the beautiful sky or the yellow moon or count stars because in a split second it can become bloody .
there is something worse than a war .
even the children have to work to support the families in those countries .
the forgotten mines take away their young dreams in a split second .
the war is still in their hearts , souls and memory .
there are people out there with one leg of their trousers hanging empty .
there is no more hissing sound of shells or sirens but a sudden sound of detonation .
to conclude -
i know he is splitting time with the hon. member for Souris - Moose Mountain .
i think he would want to ensure the other hon. member has his 10 minutes .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I thank my hon. colleague for his brilliant and erudite intervention .
what do his constituents think about the issue ?
Mr. Gurmant Grewal :
Mr. Speaker , my constituents and I are proud to support the passage of the bill by the House .
it was an honour to have the opportunity to speak in support of it .
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris - Moose Mountain , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , on an evening like this one it is difficult for someone to stand and try to say something that has not already been said .
we live in relative peace and quiet .
however , as we pass the bill , and it will be unanimous , there are people in Canada tonight who are not as easy as we are about weapons that are being concealed within our country .
people know about them but apparently there is no legal way or legal effort to stop it .
a mine is one of the easiest things to conceal and bring into the country .
nothing could be easier to hide and bring into the country than a small plastic mine .
we know from fact that many illegal guns are being smuggled into Canada every day .
i was on the plane with a chap from the city of Cornwall who mentioned the illegal smuggling that takes place there .
he talked about it being the smuggling capital of Canada .
they are bringing guns in .
having spoken to police officers in Saskatchewan and the man I met on the plane from Cornwall , maybe we have a land mine that is ready to explode .
i am pleased by the great work that has been done in the House by the minister and my colleagues .
i am pleased to support the motion .
i hope all Canadians will look around them to ensure these weapons of destruction and those who possess them will be dealt with expediently and that we in Canada do not relive anything that has been experienced by many parts of the world .
on behalf of my constituents I am pleased to say that I most assuredly will support the bill .
Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to address Bill C - 22 .
indeed , the Bloc Quebecois fully supports Bill C - 22 .
on my own behalf and on behalf of my fellow Bloc members , I want to congratulate all the NGOs involved in this issue and the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the successful conclusion of the Ottawa treaty .
everyone is aware of the ravages caused by anti - personnel mines .
the Bloc Quebecois , which is always at the forefront when it comes to world issues , warned the Liberal government a number of times in recent years regarding the atrocities caused by anti - personnel mines .
as early as December 1995 , the hon. member for Laval East rose in this House to urge Canada to eliminate these weapons of suffering , as she called them .
in May 1996 , the hon. member for Repentigny strongly condemned the agreement reached at the international conference on anti - personnel mines , then held in Geneva , where the Canadian government signed that treaty .
it will be recalled that the agreement did not fully prohibit the use of mines .
on the contrary , it stated that future mines had to be detectible or self - destructible .
the hon. member for Repentigny called the agreement " absurd " and he was absolutely right .
but it is never too late to do the right thing .
everybody must be delighted with this convention banning anti - personnel mines .
and the figures speak for themselves .
at $ 3 a piece , land mines are a cheap way of terrorizing one ' s enemies .
that is why , among other reasons , there are about 110 million land mines scattered over more than 70 countries in the world .
five million more are sold each year .
in these developing countries where mines are often forgotten , they prevent people from functioning normally .
because of mines , large tracts of land become unusable and unworkable .
food supply and development assistance are often a perilous enterprise for NGOs working in these generally poor countries , which has the direct effect of making entire communities even poorer .
and this poverty becomes even more appalling considering the inability of these countries to pay for wheelchairs or even prostheses for the victims .
and what about children ?
the most precious gift that life has given me is my two very healthy children .
it is unthinkable but nonetheless true that one quarter of the people treated for land mine injuries in Red Cross centres in Afghanistan and Cambodia are children .
what is more normal for a child than to go to school ?
in Mozambique , every day , at least one child is injured or killed by a land mine on his way to school .
this slaughter has to stop and fortunately we are on the right track .
since I became critic for international cooperation , I have been better able to see and appreciate the remarkable work done by non - governmental organizations .
it is crucial to give credit to the work done in this area by Jody Williams , the ICBL coordinator .
originally made up of a handful of well - intentioned activists and led by a very determined woman , it has become a coalition of a thousand members .
the work done by Mrs. Williams and her associates was even recognized by the Nobel Prize Committee , who presented her with the Nobel Peace Prize .
the campaign against land mines was launched at the end of 1991 .
it brought together 11 organizations representing more than a 1,000 NGOs from over 60 countries .
these organizations shared a common purpose : to ban anti - personnel mines .
considered a utopian goal at first , the idea of a ban on anti - personnel mines gained ground .
with the support of hundreds of NGOs , the ICBL was able to change the world agenda and to bring many governments on side .
following all these successful endeavours , the United Nations General Assembly passed in 1996 a resolution asking its members to actively pursue a ban on anti - personnel mines as soon as possible .
at the conclusion of what came to be known as the Ottawa process , Canada ' s Minister of Foreign Affairs concluded the conference with an invitation to governments to come to Ottawa in December 1997 to sign a treaty to ban anti - personnel mines .
that is where we are now .
needless to say , Canada has played a significant role in bringing about the treaty banning the use of land mines .
as we have seen , the aim of the Ottawa process is to have an international treaty banning the use , production , transfer and stockpiling of anti - personnel mines negotiated and signed by December 1997 at the latest .
without the initiative of the ICLM and Canada , this convention might have been delayed by a few more years , thereby taking a further and unacceptable toll in terms of human suffering and lives .
" Ottawa Round 2 " will need to look at the on - site implementation of the convention .
canada will need to ensure that the convention becomes implemented universally as soon as possible , and that new massive mine removal and victim assistance programs are adopted .
there is a shadow over the event , however .
certain countries , such as China , Russia and the USA , do not intend to sign the Convention .
it is not my intention here to pass judgment on these non - signatories .
however , reports like the one by Human Rights Watch entitled " In its own Words '' , based on archival documents from the Pentagon , and the one by Demilitarization for Democracy entitled " Exploding the Landmines Myth in Korea " argue convincingly against the marginal and often unproductive usefulness of land mines .
these reports even indicate that American land mines were one of the main causes of American losses in the Vietnam war .
such arguments , however , failed to convince the President of the United States to change his mind .
it seems fairly clear to me that , under pressure from the military lobby , the president decided not to sign the treaty .
furthermore , he said he would not sign out of a concern for protecting American troops stationed in the Korean peninsula .
in view of the high tech arsenal the United States have at their disposal , how can the U.S. president claim that they need weapons as primitive as land mines to defend American troops ?
i believe the countries that have not signed the convention simply lack the political will to do so .
this is very regrettable .
but I think that international popular pressure will eventually bring these countries around .
to conclude , I would like to remind the House that we may have won a battle , but the war is far from over .
we must remain vigilant et join forces to make this world a better place , free from the scourge of anti - personnel mines .
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Brossard - La Prairie , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , with your permission , I will share my time with the hon. parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister .
every 22 minutes a person is killed or injured by a mine that goes off .
in very concrete terms , this means that since this morning - I took my seat in this House at 11 a.m. and it is now approximately 7.10 p.m. - while I was taking part in this debate in this House some 25 people , mostly civilians and children , were killed or injured by mines .
many of my colleagues mentioned the social and environmental costs of these mines .
it is important to note that , in the final analysis , there is no proof that the use of mines has ever made a difference in any conflict .
no conflict has ever been won through the use of mines .
" with international attention focused on negotiations to destroy nuclear weapons and prevent a new nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula and in south Asia , some may think that land mines , those tiny weapons that can fit in the palm of the hand , are hardly a threat to world peace .
in fact , while reducing the threat of nuclear war must remain the first priority of international arms control efforts , it is small weapons that are killing and wounding far more people every day .
the U.S. Department of State has noted that land mines may be the most toxic and widespread pollution facing mankind .
" we are convinced that nothing less than a total ban on the production , possession , transfer and use of anti - personnel land mines will move us closer to the goal of completely eliminating this scourge .
we believe the United States should take the lead to achieve this goal '' .
the United States did not take the lead , but Canada did and we must be very proud of that .
i would like to take a few moments to mention in particular the efforts made by the Prime Minister , by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs , Andr 茅 Ouellet , by the current Minister of the Environment , and by the current Minister of Foreign Affairs who , as we all know , strove to pursue the great Canadian tradition of maintaining and promoting peace .
i would like to tell you briefly about my experience in Oslo .
i was there when the treaty was negotiated .
i was accompanied by the hon. member for Burlington and the hon. member for Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca .
the Canadian negotiators enjoyed a high level of credibility over there .
these senior public servants from Foreign Affairs and National Defence were a credit to Canada .
as the treaty was being negotiated , NGOs held a conference .
he introduced me to someone from the Red Cross as a Canadian parliamentarian .
she looked at me and said : " Well done , Canada '' .
that is an experience I am not about to forget .
it is an experience that makes one extraordinarily proud of this country .
on September 9 , the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke before the conference of NGOs .
i can tell you that the emotion in that room when he finished speaking was absolutely remarkable .
what I would like to say to all Canadians is this :
be truly proud of your political leaders .
be proud of this House , which is going to unanimously support one of the greatest humanitarian causes in recent decades .
as has been strongly emphasized , the Ottawa process is a large alliance of civilian groups , NGOs , Jody Williams , whom I congratulate , of course , and the organization she represents , as well as the Red Cross .
i would like to wrap up , if I may - it will take just a few seconds - by launching an important appeal to Canadian youth .
when I took up politics , I was criticized for being idealistic .
i would like the young people of Canada to know that , scarcely one year ago , everyone was sceptical about the Canadian initiative .
in a few days , over 100 countries will be here in Ottawa , either to sign or to indicate their moral support for this treaty to prohibit anti - personnel mines .
what I want to tell young people is that there is room for idealism in politics .
today is proof of that .
that is the embodiment of what we are doing this evening .
i know that much remains to be done to bring peace to the world , but I am immensely proud today to be taking a large step in the right direction , in the company of all my colleagues and , in fact , of the entire country .
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan ( Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , first I thank my colleague from Brossard - LaPrairie for sharing the time with me .
i rise in the House in support of Bill C - 22 , an act to implement the convention on the prohibition of the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of anti - personnel mines and on their destruction .
the member for Winnipeg North - St.
Paul is assured this House will rise to the challenge .
indeed this bill also known as the anti - personnel mines convention implementation act is a defining moment for the Canadian Parliament and therefore for the Canadian people .
the bill when enacted will implement Canada ' s obligations under the convention .
it will put in place not only domestic laws necessary to fulfil our convention obligations but also charter of rights safeguards .
it will provide Canadian courts with greater ease of interpretation to facilitate prosecution of any alleged violation .
may I at this juncture salute the government for this historic initiative and in particular , the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs for his perseverance and persuasive prowess .
the minister of course has the full support of the government caucus .
in fact , the Prime Minister himself has pursued the issue with great will and determination as well .
may I remind the House that the Prime Minister brought the subject matter to the attention of leaders of eastern and western Europe in his recent trip there a couple of weeks ago .
just a few days ago on the occasion of the APEC forum in Vancouver , he again brought the issue to the ears of President Clinton of the United States .
this government ' s commitment is resolute .
its determination to succeed is unwavering and the government sees full success on the horizon .
already we see China which has agreed to extend a moratorium on exports and will attend in December as an observer , marking China ' s first ever attendance at a land mines conference .
we see the United States which has extended its moratorium , actively seeking ways to replace the mines it now uses and has announced new action on demining and victim assistance .
we see Russia which has committed to signing at the earliest possible date .
these are very laudable developments .
in two short weeks , Canada by hosting the Treaty Signing Conference and Mine Action Forum , dubbed the Ottawa Process 1 , will show to the world Canada ' s diligent stance on seeing the insanity of anti - personnel land mines is ended .
as Canadians we have reason to be proud that our country has taken a leadership role in an issue that has climaxed to international heights because it is an issue that touches the soul of humanity .
truly we cannot forget the real tragedy of land mine victims , the incomprehensible loss of innocent children and youth , the victims for whom we are to speak .
it is the young people of today who will continue the anti - land mine legacy of our present generation if they are to see a future without deadly armaments of war that inflict harm and kill more civilians than military targets , that killed more than lives claimed by nuclear and chemical weapons combined .
we must continue to work together , taking full advantage of the momentum we have generated in Canada to help the world rid itself of these intolerable weapons '' .
we in Parliament and through us , our constituents can be part of that difference .
as the Prime Minister said recently : " We have worked with others of like - minded beliefs and showed doubters that Canada can make a real difference as a force for good in the world - .
the job has been well started , but it will not end until we persuade even more countries to sign on .
and we will keep working until the last moment and then beyond '' .
beyond the Ottawa Process 1 so we can gather the necessary minimum number of ratifications , 40 , that will allow the full force of the convention binding in international law .
beyond , so that we can help ensure a future if not totally free of war , at least free of the unnecessary loss of civilian lives , free of amputated limbs , blind eyes , scarred bodies , emotional shock , and preventable human sufferings due to anti - personnel land mines .
in conclusion , this bill is a historic one and calls on all of us to play a historic role .
i am pleased that we in Parliament on behalf of all Canadians can rise to the call with resolute confidence .
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is a privilege to speak on this very special day on a special bill which will produce an act to implement the convention on the prohibition of the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of anti - personnel mines and on their destruction .
the bill relates to the implementation of Canada ' s obligations under the international treaty on the prohibition of the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of anti - personnel mines and on their destruction .
this binds Canada to co - operate in a number of ways so as to facilitate the implementation of the treaty and to ensure that persons refrain from engaging in activities prohibited under the treaty .
Mr. Speaker , I am going to split my time with the hon. member for Kitchener - Waterloo .
each nation under the treaty undertakes to destroy or ensure the destruction of all stockpiled anti - personnel mines it owns or possesses or that are under its jurisdiction or control as soon as possible but no later than four years after entry into force of the treaty .
this is the act which is a necessary step to allow us to lead the world in signing a treaty which will ban land mines worldwide .
but today I must confess I am much more optimistic than I was only a couple of years ago .
i am not a pessimistic person by nature .
i know there is a more or less effective world ban on chemical and biological weapons but my hopes for a land mines ban were not high only a couple of years ago .
as recently as April 1996 as a part of Canada ' s delegation to the Inter - Parliamentary Union which was led by Senator Peter Bosa , we were unable to have this issue accepted as the principal agenda item , although we were able to speak to it and move it up for future agendas of IPU meetings .
despite Bruce Coburn ' s presence , attendance was sparse .
in my pessimism I underestimated the influence of the grassroots here in Canada and around the world .
ever since I was elected , I have received a steady flow of calls and letters about land mines .
whenever I visit schools , high schools or elementary , I get questions about land mines .
various groups in Peterborough have taken a continuing interest in this matter .
only yesterday in church , people were discussing the massive task of demining which is still ahead of us .
for example , one person suggested planting trees as areas are cleared of mines .
the grassroots interest has been there and is still there .
this groundswell of interest was Peterborough ' s share of what our Minister of Foreign Affairs described in his speech in the conference in Oslo .
in that same speech our Minister of Foreign Affairs paid special attention to the role of non - governmental organizations , NGOs , in the process .
i have mentioned Mines Action Canada and our own Red Cross .
he mentioned as examples the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines and the international committee of the Red Cross .
he went on to say , and again I quote from the speech in Oslo : " Clearly , now no one can relegate NGOs back to a simple advisory or advocacy role in this process .
they are now part of the way decisions have to be made .
they have been the voice saying that governments belong to the people and must respond to the people ' s hopes , demands and ideals '' .
this is a change in itself , a recognition of the proper relationship between people and their governments .
the role of the people and their NGOs is an ongoing one in this land mines ban .
it does not stop here .
again , I quote the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Oslo : " There is a question of the watch dog role for civil society '' - that is to say the grassroots - `` in evaluating the compliance of states to the obligations they have signed .
canada , the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines , and the international committee of the Red Cross and several of our core partners have consistently argued that a humanitarian treaty without traditional forms of arms control verification can be an effective response to the anti - personnel mines crisis .
this implies that civil society '' - the grassroots - `` can and will play an effective role in deterring and detecting wilful non - compliance '' .
this change in people to government relationships goes even beyond this important anti - mines treaty .
in my view , it gives us hope for moving the nations of the world toward lasting peace .
my last quotation from the speech of our Minister of Foreign Affairs in Oslo is that we need to ask ourselves whether we can maintain and build upon the close and constructive working relationship that has developed between governments and civil society through the Ottawa process , this process of producing this treaty which we are proud to call the Ottawa process .
he goes on and asks whether we can maintain and build upon the incredible sense of political momentum that this unique relationship helped to create , offering hope to millions that an integrated and effective international response to the global land mines crisis is years and not decades away .
can we demonstrate that the Ottawa process offers an effective lasting model as a response to the changing nature of international conflict ?
i would say that the only answer to all of those questions is yes , we can and must build on this wonderful example of grassroots action .
in conclusion , like my colleagues and all members of the House , I congratulate and sincerely thank all those who have brought us to this day .
i pledge my support for this bill , for the treaty and for all the follow - up activity that is required .
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Kitchener - Waterloo , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , every once in a while an event transpires in this House that galvanizes all the parties and all the members to move in one direction .
it is one of those days today .
on this issue , we have been united .
the issue is land mines , banning land mines , dismantling land mines and trying to make our world a bit more sane .
i am very proud to be a member of Parliament , to be part of this Chamber at this time .
i think all Canadians should be proud for the role that we are playing .
forty years ago on February 28 , my family and myself left Hungary and went to the Austrian frontier .
as we went across the border at night , we were conscious of the fact that we were going through land mines .
i say this because the reality of having to deal with the evil of land mines affects many people on this planet .
there are many people who are Canadians who have experience with this .
i can say that walking through a field which should not be an extraordinary exercise can be a very terrifying one .
at the time I was 10 years old , my brother was 12 and my sister was three .
my parents were in their mid - thirties .
land mines were used to keep people out but so often land mines were used in Iron Curtain countries to keep people in .
the terror of that night is something that has never left me .
it was a year ago this past September that I had the experience of being an observer for the elections in Bosnia - Hercegovina .
in an area that had a population of four million people , they had six million land mines .
when I was in Mostar , I was on a bridge over the Neretva River which divides East Mostar from West Mostar .
on one side we have Muslims and on the other side we have Croatians .
this is a very beautiful river .
after seeing it , one wants to walk down to it .
if you had your fishing rod you would want to try fishing .
it is a very beautiful and scenic site .
the reality was that you could not walk down to that river because any place you walked in Bosnia - Hercegovina you had to be always mindful that there were six million unmarked land mines .
we have to ask what kind of experience we have in terms of an individual who has to live in those kinds of conditions where the simplest pleasure of walking in the woods can be a tragic and terrifying event .
i reflect back to all the graveyards that had those fresh flowers from people who were victims of that terrible war and to know there were six million land mines waiting to go off long after the conflict was over , perhaps blowing somebody up as they were trying to rebuild their war - torn home or killing a farmer who is working in the fields or maybe killing a child playing in the fields .
i am incredibly proud to be in this Chamber .
it was back in 1956 - 57 when Canadians under Lester B . Pearson invented peacekeeping in order to deal with the problem of Suez .
we certainly are continuing in that tradition with the initiative before us today .
in lending support to what the previous speaker from Peterborough said to a grassroots movement , we are recognizing that the insanity of land mines and the insanity of war that maims hundreds of thousands , indeed millions of people , is something that we must stop and work against .
when we reflect upon the demographics in Canada and why we are the way we are as a nation , peacekeepers striving to make this planet a better place and , in many cases , representing a beacon of hope in a troubled world where we can bring people together from all corners of the world , we have one - sixth of the people in Canada who were not born in Canada , but it helps us to understand why we as Canadians so very much want to play a role to make this world a better place .
it does not matter where there is a conflict on this planet , we have Canadians who came from that part of the world with relatives and friends in their homeland who are hurting and suffering .
yes , I am incredibly proud as I think we all should be at what is taking place here today and the role that we have played in making the banning of land mines a reality in the not too distant future .
i can only commend all my colleagues for the kind of unity they have shown on this issue .
i would certainly single out the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister for pushing with such great vigour in the political arena on the international front the whole cause of banning and ridding this planet of land mines .
it is only proper that the Nobel Prize recipient , Jody Williams , was someone who spearheaded the non governmental organizations in the battle against land mines .
i also reflect back to my home community where so many people have worked on this issue , particularly the Mennonite Central Committee .
as we push this ahead , we know that we have Canadians with us .
i think we can indeed be proud of the mission which we have undertaken and the difference we are going to make .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , before I start to speak on Bill C - 22 I want to thank the Chair , the Table Officers , the staff and the pages for staying so late today on this important debate .
all of us as members greatly appreciate your efforts .
this is the perhaps the last speech tonight .
i want to say what an honour it has been to spend the day in the House listening to all the interventions by members from all party lines and showing a degree of co - operation we rarely ever see in this House .
we have by - passed the usual entrenched inefficiency of the House of Commons for once and managed to co - operate on an issue that one would find very difficult to disagree with .
once again I would like to add my name to the work that has been done by so many members of the Canadian public , the international community , the non governmental organizations and members of Parliament who sat in this House in the years gone by , and who sit in this House today .
i would particularly like to thank members of the Reform Party for supporting this initiative as eloquently as they have and as all members from the House have .
it is a shame that it took such an issue to bring us all together .
i hope that in the future we will able to perceive collectively other foreign policy initiatives which will be for the betterment of all people in this country and around the world .
bill C - 22 will save lives .
as has been mentioned before , over 30,000 people are maimed by land mines , most of whom are innocent men , women and children .
as we amputated the legs of individuals who have stepped on land mines , I could not help but reflect on the tragic circumstances those persons now face , a life which is so different from what they had before .
they went in a brief second , in the click and the blink of an eye , from being a productive , healthy member of society to one that will occupy the lowest socioeconomic rung in countries racked by civil war .
these devices do not affect rich countries like ours .
they affect the poorest nations of the world from Angola to Cambodia , from Somalia to Egypt , from Rwanda to the former Yugoslavia .
these land mines create a terrible toll , not only in human terms but also in economies laid to waste .
this bill will go a long way to preventing that carnage from occurring .
let us look beyond land mines .
let us look to life beyond land mines and see what the future holds for us .
there is life after land mines .
what we can do now is reflect on the Ottawa process and use and redirect that unusual co - operation between members of the non governmental organizations and governance working together for a common goal .
this cannot be left to wither away .
it must be acted upon , nurtured , and redirected to address other security issues facing us all .
as we look to the 21 st century and the challenges facing us as a nation as well as other nations around the world , we cannot help but reflect on the fact that we have failed in our foreign policy .
the biggest challenge is conflict .
we can reflect on the Bosnian conflict .
the signs were continually there .
we were continually told that the former Yugoslavia would tear apart and explode in a level of bloodshed that Europe had not seen since World War II.
we the nations of the world sat on our hands and wept .
we engaged at best in diplomatic initiatives and at worst in hand - wringing inefficiency when we did nothing at all .
the result was the deaths of thousands upon thousands of innocent civilians , the rapes of thousands of innocent women and the deaths of thousands of children .
it was potentially an avoidable tragedy .
certainly many of those lives could have been saved .
we were repeatedly told for months on end that a massive slaughter was imminent in the great lakes region of Africa .
major - General Rom 茅 o Dallaire repeatedly warned right to the end that thousands of people would be slaughtered .
what did we do ?
virtually nothing .
today genocide will raise its ugly head once again in the great lakes region and again we are doing nothing .
we have it within our power to use the Ottawa process to address these significant problems .
canada is a nation state uniquely poised to change foreign policy from an era of conflict management to an era of conflict prevention .
here are some constructive solutions .
there are a number of nation states of medium power which are neutral , relatively affluent , have extraordinary diplomatic power and , above all else , have international respect .
Norway , New Zealand , Australia , Austria , South Africa and Canada are some of these nations .
the world is looking for a leader to bring these nation states together to form a nucleus upon which we can start to bring other countries together to change international foreign policy .
we have to rethink the way we deal with each other as nation states .
the big powers , the security council members such as the United States , France , Germany , England , Russia and China , cannot do this because they have their own political baggage and are not as widely respected as the middle powers .
we then can play an unusual role in working with the NGO community to address the problem .
first , we must set up an early warning monitoring system to address conflict .
that early warning system could be the NGO community that would form part of the nucleus of the Ottawa process .
NGOs are often the first to witness the precursors to conflict , to witness the breakdown of judicial and governmental structures , and to witness the persecution of minorities and the trampling of basic human rights .
their input into a central region , for example the UN crisis centre in New York , would be a logical place for this information to be gathered .
it could then be dealt with by the United Nations as a whole .
we are now dealing with UN reform , which involves revamping the security council and removing veto powers from its members .
again that is something with which we as a nation and the international community will have to deal .
the solutions involve the setting up of a monitoring system and the setting up of an area to receive information , the UN crisis centre .
a series of responses could be put forth , responses such as diplomatic initiatives , peace building initiatives , the introduction of positive propaganda into areas that are breaking apart to bring belligerents together , the introduction of more punitive measures such as sanctions , where appropriate , and the use of international financial institutions as economic tools and levers to try to take away the fuel of war , which is money .
money drives wars .
the international financial institutions give a great deal of money to a number of countries of the world , some of which are in conflict .
it is exceedingly important to pursue this issue .
these are not just words .
if we fail to address it we will see an explosion of ethnic conflict .
between 1945 and 1985 there were roughly six UN peacekeeping missions that cost about $ 2.3 billion or 23 % of the UN budget .
it has driven the United Nations into bankruptcy .
this then is not a situation that can be sustained .
why should Canadians be interested in this issue at all ?
it is for the simple reason that what happens half a world away comes home to roost sooner or later .
when conflict occurs and countries explode into an orgy of bloodshed and economies are laid to waste , the responsibility for setting that up and dealing with that goes to the international community .
we incur costs in our defence budgets , our peacekeeping budgets , our aid budgets and economic reconstruction , and our social programs domestically when refugees , tragic souls , fleeing their homelands come to other countries looking for a haven .
they come to our country looking for safe haven and because we signed the UN charter on refugees we are obliged to take them in , which we do .
it costs us roughly $ 75,000 per refugee to integrate them into Canadian society .
this is a lot of money .
it contributes to the already weakened system we have in our social programs .
i am not blaming refugees by any stretch of the imagination but merely illustrating that in these days of economic hardship and of governments not having any money we cannot afford having increased costs placed upon us , not to mention the danger our peacekeepers and our aid workers incur when they go abroad .
a number of peacekeepers have been killed or maimed by land mines and working abroad in danger zones .
does it not make more sense for us to prevent these situations from occurring rather than pick up the pieces later on ?
furthermore once a war breaks out the seeds of ethnic discontent and future conflicts are sewn forever .
one need not look any further than at the situation in Bosnia to see that country will not remain as it is in the future .
it is artificially maintained right now through force .
unless we are prepared as an international community to stay in Bosnia for the next 75 years , nothing will change .
once we move , if we move before that , the country will break apart in a violent shudder .
it is important for us to realize that and to initiate efforts to ensure these situations do not occur again .
we already apply many of the principles to our economic multilateral initiatives through the NAFTA , FTA , WTO and now the MAI .
all these things are examples of the international community trying to work together to resolve differences .
in closing , I would like to say how proud I am to be a Reformer today , how proud I am to be a parliamentarian , and how proud I am to be a Canadian .
Canadians and Canada have set a new standard of co - operation in the House and internationally to pursue objectives to help those who are most helpless , to save lives and to make our world a better place .
Mr. Speaker , I stand before you and thank the House for its time .
i hope that this will not be the end of initiatives that will involve co - operation between members of the House to pursue a better Canadian society for all .
Mr. Clifford Lincoln ( Lac - Saint - Louis , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , last September my wife and I joined with my brothers and my sister for a family reunion and holiday in France .
we gathered at a farm in Normandy from which we visited the sites and beaches that World War II has made part of world history today .
two of my brothers served in uniform during the war but the rest of us were in school .
yet the place names , the events of World War II which cast such a huge shadow on the world then , were a vivid part of our consciousness and of our lives as young people .
whether it is through the awesome silence of Utah Beach , Omaha Beach or Juno Beach where our own Canadian troops landed or whether it is the stunning sight of massive concrete bunkers and gun emplacements left by the Germans , the whole historic coastline tells a story of the savagery , the utter futility and the great sadness of war and armaments .
it is difficult for anyone to visit Bayeux , Caen , Ste. M 猫 re L '脡 glise or Arromanches and not be terribly moved by the huge human cost of warfare and armaments .
each corner echoes the screams of human beings fighting in a deadly war .
thousands upon thousands of lives were literally torn apart by weapons of destruction .
whether it be bullets or mortar shells , whether it be ocean mines or land mines , weapons of war and destruction know no mercy for their only raison d '锚 tre is to maim and destroy .
as we visited war graves to pay our respects we were terribly struck by the immensity of the sacrifice .
young adults of 20 years or 25 years of age or sometimes still in their teens had been mowed to death because of one man ' s folly and pride .
millions of people , in fact tens of millions if we count the huge human losses suffered by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany , were sacrificed at the altar of war and weapons of destruction .
i can easily imagine a young Canadian - maybe he was from Quebec of from Manitoba , maybe he was from Vancouver or Toronto or Cape Breton - landing on Juno beach under an infernal shower of explosions .
what courage one must have to advance when each step may be the last , when each cannonball , each bullet , each mine becomes an instrument of death that is always more lethal and more destructive than the previous one .
have we learned our lesson about the futility of war and weapons ?
have we learned the lesson taught to us by the thousands of people around the world who have made the ultimate sacrifice , we who are so lucky not to have suffered the same fate ?
unfortunately , hundreds of thousands or even millions of innocent victims continue to pay the price of futile wars and weapons of destruction .
whether yesterday in Mozambique or in Angola , whether yesterday in Bosnia , whether today in Lebanon or in Algeria , just to name these countries , how many innocent people , how many hundreds of thousands of innocent people have endured and continue to endure these atrocious wars when all they want is to live in peace and tranquillity with their family and in their community .
i am immensely grateful that our country should be a land of peace and conciliation , shunning war and shunning armaments as means of settling disputes .
i am deeply thankful for my own children and their children that our country should be so deeply ingrained in the tradition of democracy and peace .
i salute our foreign minister and all those who worked so hard on his initiative to achieve a land mine treaty .
i thank him for having led our country toward the tangible expression and achievement of peace in a world which too often and too readily turns to hostilities and weapons of destruction to settle disputes .
may this rapid and amazing success which greeted the Canadian initiative open the way for future international disarmament initiatives .
may the land mine treaty be such a powerful symbol of the emerging century that it should lead us to a new world order where peaceful resolution of conflicts replaces the futility , the savagery and the immense human cost of war and weapons of destruction .
where the children shriek
between bursts of machine gun fire
mothers protect their bosoms
that give the sweet milk of life
soldiers trample under foot
a usurped land
in the silence of occupation
where the deaf can hear
speak to me of love .
i , a child ,
have no revolver , no tank
i do not understand
i can no longer play war
yet the grownups
play it so nicely .
i am a child
let me weep
and I will grow up tough
let me laugh now while I can
for I will not have the time for it
when I am a grownup .
indeed , the land mine treaty is a legacy for the children of the world , that they may behave differently from their elders , ourselves , and learn to live in peace , in real and lasting peace and harmony .
Ms. Jean Augustine ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the member ' s sharing his time with me .
i know the lateness of the hour but I am really honoured to stand and to speak on behalf of my constituents of Etobicoke - Lakeshore .
many of them have been watching the debate most of the day and I have had several calls of support and calls of congratulations to the men and women on both sides of this House today who stood unified , who stood together to ensure and to speak to the passage of Bill C - 22 , the anti - personnel mines convention implementation act , an act to ban the use , stockpiling and transfer of anti - personnel mines .
i am also pleased to hear not only the eloquent speeches but also the congratulatory notes and the recognition of the work that has been done by all .
on December 3 and 4 the world will be watching Canada , not only Canada but the 89 or more countries that will be here to sign this anti - personnel mines convention .
i too commend the Minister of Foreign Affairs , the United Nations Mine Action Centre and other non - governmental organizations , Jody Williams and those who have received the Nobel prize with her , those who have worked tirelessly in making the signing of the land mines convention in Ottawa on December 3 , 1997 a reality .
canada ' s efforts in ridding the world of these deadly weapons is a testament to our humanitarianism as a country , as a nation , and of the strong tradition in which Canadian foreign policy is modelled .
as a nation we are admired for our deep compassion for others less fortunate than ourselves and this is amplified in this treaty .
i was one of the group from the foreign affairs and defence standing committees who went to the former Yugoslavia , a country that laden with land mines .
i saw firsthand the devastation to lives that these weapons can do .
it is estimated that there are over 18,000 minefields in Bosnia .
it has been predicted that it could take over 70 years to clear the approximately three million land mines , land mines left from the recent conflicts .
needless to say , an estimated 25,000 civilians , many of them children , are killed worldwide each year by land mines .
this convention is long overdue .
i am proud that Canada has taken the lead in the global community to rid this planet of these horrible weapons .
bill C - 22 is the beginning to global awareness of land mines .
young and old suffer the emotional fallout of being injured or have suffered the loss of a loved one to land mines .
the signing of the convention is a starting point to bringing greater awareness to this issue .
the Ottawa process provides an opportunity to build a greater awareness .
the Ottawa process is to pursue the international community to ban the use , stockpiling , production and transfer of anti - personnel mines .
we cannot forget that once this treaty is signed by co - operating states , Canada ' s work is not over .
once this convention is signed , Canada and the world must continue to work together with nations that have not yet endorsed the convention to do so .
we know that key countries such as the United States and China have not endorsed the convention .
i am disappointed , as I am sure we all are .
their support could go a long way toward the eradication of land mines from the globe .
this is why Canada must continue to vehemently work to put pressure on those nations that are not signatories to the Ottawa treaty .
it is our obligation as a nation to make this world a safer place where children will be free from the damages caused by these deadly weapons .
i encourage young people in Canada today to look at this tremendous feat with pride and as an example of the strong political will that exists in this House .
to all the victims of land mines in the world , you have voiced your opinions about land mines .
you who know the hurt and the pain , you who know the tragedy , we have heard you .
canada has heard .
i close by saying that I am very proud that we have demonstrated leadership on this issue .
many thanks to our Minister of Foreign Affairs , our Prime Minister and our NGOs for bringing the treaty on anti - personnel land mines to fruition .
the Deputy Speaker :
is the House ready for the question ?
some hon. members :
question .
the Deputy Speaker :
pursuant to order made earlier this day , the question at the third reading stage of this bill is deemed to have been put and agreed to unanimously .

it being 8.10 p.m. , the House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) .
( the House adjourned at 8.10 p.m. )

Mr. Speaker , I rise today to provide additional information to that provided by the government House leader as to why the point of order raised by the member for St. Albert is not a valid one .
in no way do the estimates which are before the House derogate from or usurp the authority of this House to adopt legislation , nor do they presuppose the will of this House in any way .
to begin with , I would like to commend the hon. member for St. Albert on his continuing interest in the supply process and for the diligence of his research .
he will recall , through his active participation in the improved reporting to Parliament project , the initiatives that the government has taken in improving the information provided to parliamentarians over the last 12 months , initiatives in which the hon. member has been an active participant and which he has supported on two occasions in this House .
as part of the 1997 - 98 estimates process , the government introduced modifications to part III of the estimates on a pilot basis for 16 departments .
these changes were intended to improve the quality of the information provided to Parliament and to provide better information on strategic and future plans , as well as to lay the basis for providing performance information on a more timely basis .
it is in fact from the part IIIs for these pilot departments that the hon. member has drawn most of the information he uses to support his point of order .
the point of order is based broadly on the precept that the estimates should neither anticipate enabling legislation , nor should appropriation bills be used to legislate .
this is a fundamental principle and one which the government wholeheartedly supports .
i am not going to question that principle at all .
i would just indicate that the point of order which the hon. member has made in fact does not apply in this case .
the hon. member identifies five votes in which he claims that the government is seeking parliamentary approval of funds for purposes for which Parliament has not yet given legislative authority .
i will argue that this is simply not the case in any of the five votes which have been mentioned .
i can understand why the hon. member may have come to his conclusion .
in each of the five cases cited , the government has signalled its intention to modify the way it does business .
it has done this through tabling draft legislation for consideration by Parliament and , as it undertook to do as part of the improved reporting to Parliament project , it has done this by spelling out its plans in the part IIIs of the department concerned , not just for the main estimates here but for two additional years .
in being asked to approve supply legislation , Parliament is requested to approve a series of specific votes .
it is the wording of these votes that provides the legislative basis for the expenditures of government .
the previous Speakers ' rulings which the hon. member cited dealt with specific instances where this wording was considered inappropriate .
that is not the case with the appropriation bill at issue here .
in no case is the vote wording providing or seeking additional authority that has not already been granted by Parliament .
in each of the five cases identified the funds sought through the estimates process are needed for continuing operations of the programs concerned .
if the legislation authorizing the operational changes is approved by Parliament , and only if , in each case , then the funds will be spent in accordance with the new legislation .
if the enabling legislation is not adopted , then these same funds will be spent in accordance with existing parliamentary authorities .
the part IIIs from which the hon. member draws his information are all quite clear that they are dealing with future plans and in depicting any legislation at issue as proposed .
for example , part III states clearly , under Agriculture and Agri - Food Canada , and I quote :
priorities over the next three years include continuing reform of safety nets and grain policy .
part III under the heading Environment Canada is equally clear :
the proposed new CEPA , the Canadian Environmental Protection Act , will result in a more efficient process for categorizing toxic substances .
for the hon. member to argue that these votes be struck down on the basis that the government has provided specific details on its future strategies is to argue that the government should retreat under a veil of secrecy .
that is precisely what we are trying to avoid as part of the improved reporting to Parliament project , a project that , I underline again , has received the hon. member ' s support , for which I both commend and thank him .
what a wonderful opportunity these documents provide .
parliament now has a three year planning horizon to help them understand the context within which new legislative proposals will operate .
i would go so far as to suggest that this level of future planning information and disclosure is probably unique among our fellow OECD countries .
the situation is similar for the three items where the hon. member claims that we are legislating through supply legislation .
again , this is simply not the case .
vote 35 for the Canadian International Trade Tribunal is simply for program expenditures .
that is the wording of the vote .
there is nothing in these words that could possibly be construed as extending its mandate as the hon. member suggests .
the vote is neither providing nor is it seeking new or additional authority .
it is merely seeking supply .
as the hon. member notes , the Canada Communications Group item is statutory .
by definition , the amount shown is authorized by legislation previously approved by Parliament and by that same definition it is shown in the estimates or information as it does not form part of the appropriation bill that Parliament will be asked to approve .
it is statutory .
the final item with which the hon. member takes issue is the Canada Information Office .
the fact of the matter is that the order in council in question is presumed valid until repealed or set aside by a court .
given this fact , the " program expenditures " referred to in the vote can be nothing but entirely consistent with that order .
the hon. member ' s arguments simply challenge the basis for the order in council and have nothing to do with either the supply process or any impropriety in the estimates themselves .
the order in council can be challenged , but once again it is valid as long as it has not been set aside , repealed or declared invalid by the government or by the court .
part II of the estimates that I tabled earlier this year contained two assurances .
i will repeat both here again .
individual expenditure proposals included in votes seek authority during the 1997 - 98 fiscal year to make expenditures necessary to deliver various mandates which are under the administration of a Minister and are contained in legislation approved by Parliament .
in light of the House of Commons Speaker ' s ruling in 1981 , the government has made a commitment that the only legislation that will be amended through the estimates process , other than cases specifically authorized by statute , will be previous appropriation acts .
i think that in the estimates what we have done is have submitted for the vote of the House expenditures which correspond exactly to the wording of each vote .
the explanations given in part III , which once again are for three future years , explained the plans of the government in case new legislation or new policies are adopted .
in every one of the cases mentioned by the hon. member for St. Albert , the expenditures that are sought in supply are expenditures under the authority expressed properly by the wording of the votes .
the Speaker :
yesterday when the point of order was brought up I permitted what was like a mini debate .
this is new information which I have decided to hear .
if there is anything else to be added , if you are going to make an interjection you will get one shot at it .
we are not going to go back and forth .
whatever you have to say on this point of order I will listen to .
i will then take all the information , retreat and make my own decision .
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I listened to the President of the Treasury Board with interest and I appreciated the compliments regarding the work we have done on the improved performance and reporting to Parliament .
the point we want to make is that by the very definition of improved reporting to Parliament we are in command of better information in order for us to make appropriate decisions and vote according to the information laid before us .
i have already written to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans regarding one item in this improved reporting to Parliament regarding TAGS .
tags is a very important program for Atlantic Canada because of the situation there .
the new improved reporting to Parliament contains three lines regarding TAGS .
the auditor general had to write three chapters on the issue .
the fisheries committee has been consumed with the issue since then .
however , this improved reporting has given us three lines to tell us the government ' s initiatives , its plans , its hopes and aspiration for this program .
therefore , what I am trying to tell you , Mr. Speaker , is that this improved reporting to Parliament has a long way to go .
perhaps this debate we are having today would indicate that the government has an obligation to clearly set out in the part IIIs , which is an amplification of the information in the part IIs , the Appropriation Act , so that we can understand what is in the part IIs and also provide their direction as to where they are going down the road in the future .
i draw your attention to the points I raised yesterday regarding the Ports Canada Corporation .
in the part IIIs and in the part IIs the budget has been reduced to zero for this fiscal year .
the corporation is still ongoing because the legislation has not been passed in this House .
obviously the work the corporation was doing is still ongoing .
obviously the money it is spending is coming from somewhere because the proposal by the minister is that budget be zero .
we are being asked to vote on that budget to say the budget is zero .
we know , the minister knows , the Minister of Transport knows that the work is ongoing and the methodology and the focus of the government will change once the legislation is passed .
here we are in this particular instance , and no doubt it applies to the others too , where by our vote this evening , if we are to vote , we will endorse something the government intends to implement rather than voting for what has taken place so far .
the minister talked about legislation , using the part IIIs , improved reporting to Parliament and how they outline initiatives that the government may wish to take .
hence he used that to justify his argument about legislation to be introduced .
as I said , the government has an obligation to tell us what we are voting on .
we do not want to debate the issues of the estimates in a vacuum .
this was the whole debate regarding the improved reporting to Parliament as far as the estimates , the performance documents and so on , and the whole debate circled around that .
but we do not want to try to determine the $ 50 billion odd that we are voting on without having it in context .
so we ask the government to lay out its plans for the future .
the performance documents will give us some historical documentation in the same format so we can assess the issues .
but we specifically ask that the estimates be laid out clearly as this year ' s appropriations within the context of a wider vision , forward and historical .
again I tell the minister , and I use the TAGS example of three lines for a very major and important program that affects very seriously a major part of this country , that if the government feels that improved reporting to cover what it is doing this year , next year and how it is going to resolve the issue down the road can be covered off in three lines , that beats me .
i think that speaks for itself .
the minister talked about the proposed environmental protection act .
part IIIs talk about the proposed environmental protection act .
it was introduced in the last Parliament .
i said yesterday that the part IIIs were introduced last February 20 and the identical documents were introduced on October 1 , even though it now appears that with the intervening election the government ' s initiatives , agenda and list of priorities have changed .
we are being asked to vote an appropriation act based on the government ' s agenda as it was before the election , not as it is today .
we know , because the government did not table all the legislation that died on the order paper , that the government ' s agenda has changed .
surely if the government had respect for this House it would have redrafted the estimates to reflect the new initiatives and it sought not to do so .
there is nothing in the part IIIs to suggest that the government intends to introduce legislation .
on CCG , the Canada Communications Group , the minister talks about it being a statutory program .
i outlined in my argument yesterday why even though it is a statutory program we as parliamentarians are being asked to vote on it .
it is because it has a revolving fund and we vote on revolving funds .
take that into consideration , Mr. Speaker , when you are doing your deliberations please .
no one else has it .
no one else has ever had it .
we know that by our parliamentary democratic procedure that nobody else should have it .
if we are to believe in the theory of taxation and representation this House and this House alone retains for itself the right to pass these things .
therefore I ask you , Mr. Speaker , to set aside the minister ' s arguments that this is a valid procedure until struck down by a court of law .
we are asking you , Mr. Speaker , to stand up for this court and rule accordingly .
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , you heard from the official opposition yesterday what our concerns were .
we indicated to you that there was a considerable amount of expert study into this matter .
this is not something that just a couple of researchers had looked at .
it had been done for some time .
i could go through some of the comments the President of the Treasury Board made but I do not think I want to duplicate anything and I believe my colleague from St. Albert has done a very good job on that .
however , I want to make two observations on the differences in the argument .
for instance , the minister said he was not seeking new authority , he was seeking supply .
we maintain that there is no legislated authority to seek supply for , and that is the big substantive difference in this argument .
Mr. Speaker , I think all the way through the argument that was put to you by the government side , notwithstanding what the minister said , he needs to get the Canadian information office , for instance , established before seeking supply .
therein lies the problem with the vote tonight .
we are being asked to supply before we legislate .
it cannot be .
this party cannot vote for such an approach .
i sincerely hope , Mr. Speaker , that when you deliberate and look at this today and decide prior to the votes tonight you remove those items that are in fact illegal .
give us an opportunity to approve or at least vote for the items that we feel perhaps could pass that test .
there is a very important test today that you are being asked by the official opposition to apply and look at .
the Speaker :
the hon. President of the Treasury Board .
hon. Marcel Mass 茅 :
Mr. Speaker , I have listened with care and attention to the arguments being given .
i would submit to you that the first one by the hon. member for St. Albert that the part IIIs should be improved is certainly one with which I could agree .
part IIIs should be improved .
in the course of the years to come we plan to give more information and more specific results .
however , I would also indicate that this fact does not affect the controversy on whether the five votes are properly submitted to the House .
on the second comment that we should have redrafted the estimates because the government after an election has new priorities , I suggest that if we did that we would be committing the sins that the opposition is reproaching us for which is that before having legislative approval in the House we would be redrafting the estimates to show what our new priorities are before they have been implemented through legislation approved by the House .
therefore , although I agree that the estimates should be drafted in the most appropriate manner possible , I submit they are at present drafted in the right way until new legislation has been approved by the House .
on the point that this House is the highest court of the land , I would not oppose the argument .
i would merely submit that when we have an order in council that gives the authority for a program to be implemented , that order in council remains as the legal authority until it is repealed or set aside and until Parliament perhaps , if it is the highest court in the land , declares that it is illegal .
until that point , that order in council is a valid basis for a vote to include supply .
my last point about the information office is exactly that .
the information office must be established first before seeking supply .
i submit that the information office has been established .
it was established by order in council .
we and our lawyers believe that the order in council is valid .
once again it is held to be valid as the authority for establishing a program until it is repealed or set aside , which it has not been .
therefore the vote that deals with the information office is also under the authority of an order in council that is still valid and therefore means the creation of a proper information office for which we can seek supply because the information office has a legislative basis .
the Speaker :
i do think all the members who took part in this point of order are trying to clarify both sides .
as I said yesterday , I have been gathering information .
i will take into consideration the material and opinions that have been put forward this morning .
it is my intention to rule on this .
if it is at all possible , I will rule on this before the votes take place this afternoon .
that is my intention right now .

Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 ( 8 ) I have the honour to table in both official languages the government ' s responses to five petitions .

proportional REPRESENTATION REVIEW ACT
Mr. Speaker , the bill would simply establish an all party committee that would have the power to travel to all provinces and territories of this country to consult the Canadian people on various forms of proportional representation that could be mixed into our current system and to study the various forms of proportional representation .
the committee would report back to the House and with the concurrence of the House cause a national referendum to be held where the people themselves could choose between the current single member constituency electoral system that we have and the method of proportional representation to be mixed into that system as recommended by the House of Commons through that committee .
i believe this would allow the people ' s votes to be reflected accurately in the House of Commons which is not the case today .
it is really a new democracy for a new millennium .

Mr. Roger Gallaway ( Sarnia - Lambton , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 288 , an act to amend the Broadcasting Act ( broadcasting policy ) .
the bill as presented today is the same bill that was introduced in the 35 th Parliament and as subsequently amended by the Senate .
it has received the support of the Minister for Canadian Heritage as stated in the House last spring .
the bill will simply give consumers the right to say no to cable company services , something that consumers have wanted as evidenced most recently by the unfair practices of Videotron in the Montreal marketplace .

bank ACT
Mr. Speaker , I would like to begin by indicating that this bill is inspired by an act that has been in existence in the United States since 1977 , called the community reinvestment act .
the purpose of this bill is to require banks to reach , to all intents and purposes , a better balance between the deposits they receive and the loans they make , particularly where disadvantaged communities are concerned .
i hope this bill will receive unanimous consent in this House .

petitions
criminal CODE
Mr. Myron Thompson ( Wild Rose , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to rise today on behalf of a number of constituents from the Trochu area of Alberta .
their petition states the following .
that section 43 of the Criminal Code states that every school teacher , parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or a child who is under his care if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances .
that section 43 recognizes the primary role of parents in raising and disciplining their children .
that the federal government is under pressure from various sources , including the United Nations to remove section 43 because we ratified the UN convention on the rights of the child .
that the removal of section 43 would strengthen the role of bureaucrats while weakening the role of parents in determining what is in the best interests of children and therefore would be a major and unjustified intrusion by the state into the realm of parental rights and responsibilities .
that despite its stated intent to preserve section 43 at this time , the government continues to fund research by people who advocate for its removal and will be facing Senate Bill S - 14 which calls for the repeal .
your petitioners request Parliament to affirm the duty of parents to responsibly raise their children according to their own conscience and to retain section 43 .

government ORDERS
supply
allotted DAY - CALGARY DECLARATION
that this House recognize that strengthening the unity of Canada is its highest priority and given that nine provincial premiers and two territorial leaders have begun a process of consultation on national unity built on the Calgary declaration , this House :
endorses the efforts of the premiers , the territorial leaders and grassroots Canadians to foster national unity ;
2 . declares its support for the consultation process begun by the premiers and territorial leaders ;
3 . urges Canadians to become involved in the consultation process and in particular to express their approval of , disapproval of , or suggested improvements to such principles as the equality of citizens and provinces , respect for diversity including the unique character of Quebec society , and the need for rebalancing the powers of the provincial and federal governments ;
4 . urges the Government of Canada and members of this House to communicate with Quebeckers regarding the Calgary declaration , and to consult the people of Quebec on its contents ; and
5 . regrets that the separatist government of Quebec has chosen not to participate in the discussion of national unity , and has refused to include Quebeckers in the consultation on the Calgary declaration .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
since today is the final allotted day for the supply period ending December 10 , 1997 , the House will go through the usual procedures to consider and dispose of the supply bill .
in view of recent practices , do hon. members agree that the bill be distributed now ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
Mr. Rahim Jaffer :
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Dauphin - Swan River .
i will repeat the motion so it is clear for all members of the House :
that this House recognize that strengthening the unity of Canada is its highest priority and given that nine provincial premiers and two territorial leaders have begun a process of consultation on national unity built on the Calgary declaration , this House :
endorses the efforts of the premiers , the territorial leaders and grassroots Canadians to foster national unity ;
2 . declares its support for the consultation process begun by the premiers and territorial leaders ;
3 . urges Canadians to become involved in the consultation process and in particular to express their approval of , disapproval of , or suggested improvements to such principles as the equality of citizens and provinces , respect for diversity including the unique character of Quebec society , and the need for rebalancing the powers of the provincial and federal governments ;
4 . urges the Government of Canada and members of this House to communicate with Quebeckers regarding the Calgary declaration , and to consult the people of Quebec on its contents ; and
5 . regrets that the separatist government of Quebec has chosen not to participate in the discussion of national unity , and has refused to include Quebeckers in the consultation on the Calgary declaration .
i understand it is not easy for the Prime Minister to stand up to Mr. Bouchard and his separatist acolytes .
as the Prime Minister has spent his political career humouring and appeasing the separatists , he was displaying his exceptional leadership skills when he said he might put the Calgary Declaration to Quebeckers .
i thought maybe he needed time to formulate a plan .
did he put the time to good use ?
No. Instead of formulating a plan for submitting the Calgary Declaration to Quebeckers , he simply pretended it was not necessary to consult them .
why bother consulting the people of Quebec on the Calgary Declaration , when they already know what it is about and already support the constitutional proposal ?
why waste all that money holding public consultations in Quebec and risk displeasing the separatists , when you know already what Quebeckers think about the issue ?
that is the message the Prime Minister was sending to Canadians .
finally , on October 3 , the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said in this House that the Calgary Declaration had support from British Columbia to Newfoundland .
i found it strange when the Globe and Mail reported on September 29 that a public poll showed that Quebeckers did not even understand the Calgary declaration .
Quebeckers do not know whether or not the expression " unique character " means the same thing as " distinct society '' .
they are not sure whether the Calgary declaration would give them the same powers , fewer powers or more powers .
yet , according to the Hon. Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Quebeckers strongly support the declaration .
i think it would be better to consult with the people of Quebec on this before stating that they support it .
and the Quebeckers I spoke to agree with me .
on October 31 , nearly a month after questioning the Prime Minister about public consultations , I asked him if he had any concrete plans for consultations in Quebec .
the reply I got was that the government still had no plans in that respect .
one month later , the government did not even have a plan .
at that time , all the provinces and territories , except Quebec , were conducting public consultations or in the process of planning and preparing for consultations .
only Quebec was not in on this , and the government was still dragging its feet .
i looked at the public consultation plans of the provinces and territories .
in fact , members of the Reform Party actively encourage their constituents to participate in these consultations .
we want Canadians to take charge of their country ' s future .
i had hoped that the Prime Minister would want Quebeckers to do the same , but this seems to be the least of his worries .
since I am a particularly persistent man , on November 19 , I asked the Prime Minister again - for the third time - whether he would be putting the Calgary declaration to the people of Quebec and respecting their democratic right to participate in constitutional consultations which are likely to change the face of this country .
here is what the Prime Minister replied : " We are not saying that we will not hold consultations in Quebec but at the same time we are not saying that we will '' .
after nearly two months , the Prime Minister has nothing to say and Canadians are losing patience .
we must not let the Calgary declaration fail through negligence .
if it does not capture the interest of Canadians , if it is incapable of defining and embodying the future values and visions of Canadians , it will have failed for good reason .
but if it fails because the people of Quebec do not view it as a constitutional proposal that they have helped to forge and that reflects their desire for greater autonomy , then it will have failed because of the negligence of this government .
the people of Quebec deserve to be heard .
i therefore urge the Prime Minister to set aside petty political considerations and to consult the people of Quebec without delay .
i urge the Prime Minister and the Liberal caucus to support this motion .
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I have a question for the hon. member .
as part of the hon. member ' s policy and platforms it is the position of Reformers that they consult with their constituents .
if the constituents do not agree with the motions or the suggestions put on the table , those members vote with the constituents .
has the member consulted with his constituents of Edmonton - Strathcona ?
in the last election campaign that position was not put forward by the Reform or the people who supported his party .
has he consulted with his constituents ?
if he has , what is their answer ?
if the answer is not in support of the motion , is it a fact that he would then vote against it ?
Mr. Rahim Jaffer :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to clarify .
i hope the member understands what I have addressed in the motion .
to address his question , I had a town hall meeting .
i consulted a number of people in my riding on the issue .
my colleagues in caucus and I have encouraged various people with different opinions on the Calgary declaration to actually communicate them to their provincial governments through this public consultation process .
once the public consultation process is over we will know exactly how the people of Canada feel about it .
then we as a political party can act on their feelings .
as the motion stands , we are only clarifying and encouraging Canadians to take part in what we feel is a very important part of the future of the country .
Mr. Dennis J . Mills ( Broadview - Greenwood , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I begin by congratulating the member for Edmonton - Strathcona for having the initiative to table in parliament such an important issue .
as I read the member ' s motion I felt a couple of things were missing but one in particular .
toward the end of the last parliament one of our members , Len Hopkins from Renfrew , the dean of the last parliament , sponsored a private member ' s bill , Bill C - 441 , an act respecting the territorial integrity of Canada .
i will read one sentence on the principles :
this Act reaffirms that the Government of Canada has a moral and a legal responsibility to maintain and protect the territorial integrity of the Federation as it presently exists , or as its territory may be increased in future by constitutional amendment or otherwise , and that this responsibility is based on the following principles :
he goes on and on to indicate that Canada is a sovereign state , one and indivisible .
in the spirit of open debate , would the member consider including an amendment in his motion that would take in that member ' s private member ' s bill ?
Mr. Rahim Jaffer :
Mr. Speaker , I am encouraged by the comments and the question of my colleague from Broadview - Greenwood .
i would like to clarify that I am in favour of what he just mentioned and the fact that Canada is indivisible .
i agree wholeheartedly with that private member ' s bill in the last parliament .
in this motion I tried to emphasize the importance of the Calgary declaration that is being considered right now as we speak .
it is important for Canadians to take the time to participate in the process .
it is a short process .
most provinces are winding up the process by mid - February .
although I am in favour of what the member just put forward it is important , instead of clouding it up with other issues , to stick to the content of the Calgary declaration .
i encourage my constituents who may have the same concern to include it in their comments as they submit them to the provincial government .
i thank the hon. member for his question .
Mr. Inky Mark ( Dauphin - Swan River , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , as a member of the unity team representing the municipalities , I am pleased to speak to the very important topic of unity .
we all know that this discussion is necessary and is on the minds of most Canadians .
i begin by telling the House what the Official Opposition has done so far to promote public awareness and discussion of the Calgary declaration .
we have circulated two letters to more than 4,400 municipal councils in Canada encouraging them to get involved in the process .
that is the first order of government , the level of government closest to the people .
we have circulated copies of the Calgary declaration to municipal leaders on demand .
we have circulated letters to all the premiers encouraging them to get involved with the municipal leaders in discussions .
we have asked the prime minister to make a copy of the Calgary declaration available to every household in Quebec .
some questions need to be raised about what the government is doing at this point in time .
what leadership has the prime minister taken to involve Quebeckers in awareness and discussion of the Calgary declaration ?
i would like to elaborate on some of these points .
i will begin by addressing the issue of municipalities , governments that are part of the main stakeholders in the Canadian unity debate .
Canadians are looking for leaders who will work in positive ways to strengthen and to unify the Canadian federation .
there is no doubt that many of my former municipal colleagues in the House , and there are at least 60 of them , believe that the municipalities should be heard and taken into account .
it is long overdue that the federal government recognize municipal governments as legitimate entities in their own right .
i reiterate that in 1996 the current prime minister in Calgary , at a meeting of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities , acknowledged the importance of municipalities .
he indicated that he would do something more than just acknowledge them as an entity and their own rights .
we are still waiting for that to occur .
as a newly elected member of Parliament and as Official Opposition deputy critic on national unity for municipalities , I want to make sure that municipalities are involved in building a better and more united Canada .
during the last federal election national unity emerged as a key issue , certainly in my riding .
federalists across Canada , regardless of political affiliation , were disturbed by the near failure of the federalist side during the last Quebec referendum campaign .
there is a deepening conviction among more and more Canadians that a positive resolution to the unity issue requires a two pronged approach .
one is a vigorous , inspiring and far - sighted vision for making federalism work better , a vision of a 21 st century Canada which appeals deeply to all Canadians , including Quebeckers .
this vision must reconcile and integrate the values and aspirations of importance to Canadians in every part of our country and at every level of government .
the Reform Party of Canada , which now forms the official opposition in this House , is committed 100 % to the task of building a better and more united Canada , a Canada that includes Quebec as a full , essential partner .
specifically , we have committed to co - operating not only with federal and provincial governments but also with Canadian municipal governments to help develop a vision for a better Canada and to propose alternatives where these are needed , including in Quebec .
over the last six years as a municipal official , it was my privilege to visit and speak to many municipalities across this country .
it is my conviction that public support is growing for a new non - constitutional effort designed to strengthen the unity of this country and that such an effort should focus on defining a vision of a better Canada which includes the following five elements .
first , a stronger commitment from the federal government to the equality of citizens and provinces in law .
second , a rebalancing of the federal and provincial powers to meet the demands of the 21 st century that take into account the responsibilities of municipalities as the governments closest to the people .
third , ensuring this rebalancing equips each province with the tools required to protect and develop the unique features of their economies and societies .
fourth , reform the institutions of Parliament and the federal system to make them more effective and accountable to the representation of local , regional and public interests .
fifth , ensure genuine consultations with the public involving them in any major changes to the federation .
municipalities are putting forth resolutions that will reconcile and integrate the principles and values of equality , uniqueness , balance of powers , effective representation and public involvement which go a long way toward defining the vision that Canadians are looking for to strengthen and unite the country .
i do not have time to read the many letters that I have received from municipalities across Canada , but I will at this time indicate the meat of the letter that I sent to the premiers on September 18 which reads " Municipal leaders across Canada are already making clear that they have a stake in the future of our country .
municipal governments frequently refer to themselves as the first order of government , the government closest to the people .
could we encourage municipal leaders to participate and hold town hall style meetings in each community open to residents of the communities with the assistance of facilitators .
the information will be provided by the provincial governments with input from experts , including the participation of local MLAs , MPPs and MNAs .
the key advantage of such a process and mechanism is the opportunity to transcend political partisan loyalties over commitments .
this is the kind of leadership I believe Canadians are looking for . "
i would like to close by saying that Canada is a federal union of provinces and territories and Canada desires a balanced federation where provinces and citizens enjoy equal status before the constitution and the law of Canada .
Canadians nationally and in each province and territory desire a country with better jobs , with brighter prospects for their children , with better health care , with more responsible and efficient government services , lower taxes , greater individual freedoms and more open and accountable government institutions .
therefore , the Government of Canada and the provinces should pursue only policies and legislation which express the aspirations of Canadians to build a better Canada , more equal and united from sea to sea .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , having myself been a mayor for 10 years , I have much in common with the hon. member , who spoke about the importance of municipalities .
i would like to ask the hon. member if , in his opinion , constitutional changes indicating whether municipalities should come under provincial or federal jurisdiction are required .
does the hon. member think changes are required ?
Mr. Inky Mark :
Mr. Speaker , I think this is an opportune time for this country to re - evaluate the relationship between the three levels of government .
the hon. member may know or may not know that there are other countries in the world which only have two levels of government and do not have three levels such as this country .
the reality of history is that municipal governments existed long before the federal system came into being , way before confederation came about .
even though the provinces always elaborate and keep saying the municipal governments are the creatures of the provinces , they have taken a very paternalistic approach to the relationship between provinces and municipalities , it is high time we have a little more equality among all three levels .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I listened with interest to the speech by the Reform member on today ' s opposition motion .
i find it somewhat disconcerting that he seems to claim that , since municipalities are the level of government closest to the public , they should be the ones doing the consultations .
they should be the ones reviewing the agreement - the term " agreement " is used , but it is saying a lot about a piece of paper signed in Calgary , since there is absolutely no agreement in it , only proposals made with everybody ' s input .
is the hon. member really saying that municipalities should be the ones consulting people on this meaningless piece of paper ?
what I find even more disconcerting is the question from the Quebec MP who asked the member whether he thinks municipalities should come under federal jurisdiction .
the Reform member says that everything is on the table and that this may be an opportune time to consider such an option .
i should remind the hon. member that municipalities are created by legislative assemblies - the National Assembly in Quebec ' s case .
according to the Canadian Constitution , not our constitution , not the constitution we never accepted , but the Constitution of 1867 , they come under provincial jurisdiction .
it is not up to the municipalities to examine or decide whether an agreement or a piece of paper such as the Calgary declaration is good or not .
i find it strange that the Reform member , and the member who tabled the motion , are concerned about Quebec and the consultation process , given that , according to the media , the consultation in their own part of the country , in their own province , is a phoney consultation in which practically no one is interested or involved .
i would appreciate it if the hon. member could comment on my remarks .
Mr. Inky Mark :
Mr. Speaker , I respect the hon. member ' s comments and I respect his position .
i do know that municipal governments are under the responsibility of all provincial governments , including the province of Quebec .
i think the object here is to encourage provincial governments to seek the assistance of municipalities to get into the milieu of discussion .
the downfall of the last attempts with Canadian unity was the lack of grassroots involvement .
if the hon. member believes in accountability to the people who elected and sent him to Ottawa , then I believe that the municipal governments and the citizens who live there and pay taxes are equally as important as the people who sit in the legislature at the provincial level .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like first of all to thank the member for Edmonton - Strathcona and also the member for Dauphin - Swan River for their initiative today and to explain why the Government of Canada will support this motion from the opposition .
Canadian unity is not a partisan issue .
we have our disagreements on how this country should be governed , and it is normal in a democracy that there be a liberal approach , a social - democratic approach , a conservative approach and a reform approach , or whatever we choose to call it .
what is important , however , is that we all work together for the unity of Canada .
the premiers have proposed principles that can gain the support of all Canadians , and as such can strengthen our unity .
the Calgary declaration is not the only part to Canadian unity , but it is an important one to show that Quebeckers , just like Albertans , just like all Canadians , share values and can look forward to the next century with a shared purpose rather than in a spirit of division .
that is the objective of this declaration .
it is a wonderful declaration because it shows that in Canada , perhaps more than in any other country , we know that equality is not the same thing as uniformity .
equality is an important value that is being pursued further in Canada than anywhere else , along with diversity , which is also an important value , and this country finds its strength in diversity .
diversity is not at all at issue ; it is a strength , and these two values go together .
that diversity covers various features .
there is of course the bilingual character of the country ; there is the multicultural character of the country , there is the contribution made by aboriginal peoples , and there is the Quebec society , which is in a unique situation in North America , for reasons on which everyone can agree .
what is also new in the Calgary declaration is the fact that it is clearly stated that no special status is being created for anyone .
if they are provinces , equality of status always applies , but recognition of the equal status of the provinces should not prevent , in fact it should promote , taking into consideration the particular circumstances of each province , because we have a very diverse country , and circumstances in Alberta are not in many respects the same as those in Nova Scotia .
one province is totally unique by virtue of its majority language , its culture , its civil code , its own institutions , and that province is Quebec .
there can be recognition of this province ' s unique situation without creating a situation of inequality compared to the others , merely by stating that everything to be given to one province , in light of its particular situation , must also be available to the others if they should require it .
Quebeckers are not jealous people .
they do not want anything for themselves that others would not be able to have .
they simply want assurance that , in this decentralized federation , their identity and their way of being Canadians " 脿 la Qu 茅 becoise " can be reinforced in the coming century with the assistance of other Canadians .
other Canadians , Albertans and citizens from other provinces , are not jealous people either .
they are not saying that since they do not need it , they do not want Quebeckers to have it .
they just said that anything that is available for a province must be available for the provinces because this is equality .
it is in this way that we have reconciled the values of diversity and equality .
we must commend all the premiers for having done that and we must support them .
i am very pleased to see how in this House the parties that believe in Canada speak with one voice .
we support those principles .
i want to quote a great Canadian , a key Canadian for this very moment in our history coming from the province of the hon. member .
" i believe in a Canada where all provinces have equal status , but a Canada that allows Quebec to protect those things that make it such a unique part of our national character .
do not think those two principles cancel each other out .
the Canada I am describing might be familiar to many because most of us grew up here in the tolerant and diverse nation where we are equal as Canadians no matter where we live , but where the word equality is not used as a blanket to smother diversity . "
i agree with that fully .
that is exactly the spirit of the Calgary declaration which was stated last spring , well before the Calgary declaration , by Premier Ralph Klein .
so it is not a partisan matter .
we are with premier Klein and with all the premiers , in this initiative which is aimed at enhancing our key values .
as the Leader of the Opposition said recently , Alberta political leaders have chosen to act as big westerners , not little westerners on this issue .
i am very proud to share this country with the hon. member from Alberta .
we will fight together to make sure that we will stay fellow citizens .
whatever arguments we may have about social , economic and criminal policies , we will have the pleasure of fighting together in the same country .
we are are having a disagreement right now which is not a fundamental one .
it is a disagreement about how to speak to Quebeckers at this very moment .
it is not fundamental but it is something we have to discuss .
i am happy that this discussion will occur today .
the point of view of the government today is that it is too soon for that .
as the member from the Bloc said , it is not so easy to consult with people even in a province where a premier like Premier Klein is strongly supporting the resolution of the Calgary declaration .
it is not easy because when people get up in the morning it is not their first preoccupation to listen to a debate about this declaration .
it does not mean that people do not support it .
in fact , if they were strongly against it the likelihood that they would rush to these kinds of consultations would be greater .
however , I think they support the principles .
i know that polls are polls , but what is interesting are the polls that are compared with the ones we had in Charlottetown or Meech .
when we go into the details of the declaration , the support is even greater for the declaration in Quebec .
when they are asked " Do you support citizen equality ? '' ,
there is very strong support .
when they are asked " Do you support the equality of status of the provinces ? '' ,
there is strong support .
and when they are asked " Do you support the recognition of Quebec ' s unique character ? '' ,
there is very strong support .
in other words , the more detail there is given on the declaration , the more people support it , and this is grounds for considerable optimism , even if the process of consultation in those provinces whose premiers support the process is not as easy as some would believe .
people are not rushing to share their points of view , but there are still grounds for considerable optimism .
where are we headed with all this ?
it is desirable for the premiers of the nine provinces and the territorial leaders who believe in a powerful united Canada , coming out of these consultations , to be able to find sufficient public support to enable them to submit to their respective parliaments a statement of principle , which will no doubt be fairly close to the Calgary declaration and will show the extent to which Canadians do , in fact , share the same values .
this will lead to declarations by the legislatures .
it will not be a constitutional act .
we are not speaking about the Constitution now .
it is a declaration of principles that shows that yes , we share values .
if one day we are ready , especially if there is a premier in Quebec who believes in Canada , we will see if there is still support among the people for something that would be a more legal document that we may consider putting in the Constitution .
the approach that we have with the support of the Leader of the Opposition and all the leaders in the House who believe in Canada and who support the step by step approach is something great and I am very proud to do it with all my colleagues in the House who believe in Canada .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to thank the hon. minister for his very constructive remarks and his leadership on this issue .
the minister will know that many people , particularly in western Canada , continue to be concerned about the singling out of the unique character of Quebec society in the fifth clause of the Calgary declaration .
the concern is that this will be the seed of a new distinct society interpretive justiciable clause which could create two categories of provinces in Canada .
i wonder if the hon. minister could address that concern .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion :
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question .
it is a legitimate question , but I do not think the concern is well advised .
it has been very clear since the beginning that with an interpretive clause , first , you cannot override what is clear in the Constitution .
it is something which helps to interpret the Constitution when the Constitution is not clear .
second , it cannot give to one province more powers or privileges than it gives to other provinces .
in order to be sure that it is very clear that this is not special status , what the Calgary declaration added is the principle stating that if any future constitutional amendment confers powers on one province , those powers must be available to all provinces .
Newfoundland will not have full autonomy in this field .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am rather surprised that the government is supporting the Reform Party ' s motion faulting the Quebec government , which will not be consulting Quebeckers on the Calgary declaration or at least has yet to decide to do so .
first , what does he think of the statement by Mike Harris , who trivialized the concept of unique character to the point of describing it in terms of Pacific salmon ?
second , what does he think of the report in this morning ' s papers that only 4 % of Albertans know about the Calgary declaration , that a televised report revealed last week that some people thought it concerned a labour dispute and that others did not know there was such a declaration ?
how can he preach ethics to us , when the people of Alberta , the people voting for the Reform Party , are not aware of the Calgary declaration ?
how can he say that they are not speaking up probably because they support it ?
i would like him to explain his remarks .
if people are unaware of something and they do not talk about it , it is probably because they agree with it .
that is what he said .
on the subject of the powers to be given to everyone , not just Quebec , I would ask him to list the powers that will be given to Quebec and the other provinces in Canada as the result of the Calgary declaration .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion :
Mr. Speaker , I will start by answering the last comment .
should it become a legal text enshrined in the Constitution , in itself it would not confer any powers on anyone .
however , it would reflect the values on which this country must build .
one of these values is certainly ensuring that each constituent part of this country can develop on the basis of its own identity and particular values .
here is another example .
bijuralism is an asset to Canada .
it is a great advantage to have two legal systems in Canada , and so is having two official languages .
but this bijuralism needs to be strengthened , especially now that we are expanding our relations with countries whose legal culture is different from ours , and this ability to understand two different legal cultures , based on the fact that we have two in our country , gives us an advantage on countries where there is only one legal tradition .
we have decided , and I will close with this , to better harmonize federal legislation with the Quebec civil code .
this will be very good for Quebeckers and for all Canadians .
Mr. Leon E . Benoit ( Lakeland , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
i believe we should have more time for questions .
i assume the minister would have a half hour spot here in this debate which would include his speech and questions .
we have only had about 20 minutes .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
is there unanimous consent ?
some hon. members :
No.
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
there is not unanimous consent .
Mr. Leon E . Benoit :
Mr. Speaker , I was not looking for unanimous consent to extend debate , although I would certainly be happy to get that .
under the rules of this debate I believe each speaker is given a half hour to make comments and then to answer questions unless they specifically state that they will share their time .
did the minister do that or will we have the half hour ?
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
in the second round it goes to the method by which you are assuming it is all going .
after the first intervention we are at 10 minutes and 5 minutes .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I too would like to say a few words on the Calgary declaration .
in my statement , I will elaborate on some of the points that have just been mentioned .
first of all , we are discussing this issue today following an initiative by the Reform Party , which wants Parliament to endorse the Calgary declaration .
it also wants to blame the Government of Quebec for not holding consultations on the Calgary declaration .
behind all of this , we can also see that the Reform Party is starting to look for a way out , on this issue .
there are four aspects I would like to deal with quickly :
why the Calgary declaration , the consultation process , the absence of consultations in Quebec , and , finally , the reasons behind the Reform Party ' s initiative .
why the Calgary declaration ?
i have to go quickly and I will not have enough time in ten minutes to cover all the history behind this , but I will point out some main events .
it should be remembered that following patriation in 1982 of the Constitution , which was not signed by Quebec and where Quebec was isolated , attempts were made to remedy this extraordinary error by the Liberal Party of Canada , but also with several premiers , some of whom are still around today .
as we all know , this led to the Meech Lake accord , which failed , and then there was the Charlottetown accord , which was rejected by the population .
i do not want to spend too much time on these events that have been dealt with at length by others .
this led to the arrival in the federal Parliament of regional parties , a trend that was maintained following the last federal election .
but above all , this led to the 1995 referendum .
very often , federalists forget to mention that there were two referendums in Quebec , even three .
in 1992 , Quebeckers refused to endorse the Charlottetown accord , by which Quebec would have signed the patriation of the Constitution under the Charlottetown conditions .
we must always remember that Quebeckers said that no , under those conditions , they would not sign .
this is an important issue in this debate .
it seems that federalists have a selective memory and that they forget that episode .
in 1995 , with a participation rate of over 93 % , 49.5 % of the population voted yes on the proposal for the sovereignty of Quebec accompanied by a offer to form a partnership with the rest of Canada .
in a panic , faced with this result , Ottawa did not know exactly how to react and took a hard line , with everything that implied under plan B , to attack Quebec , to make people think that the question was not understood , nor the issues , and everything else , and to come up with the greatest scare tactics that were ever used , on territory , etc.
in fact , we know that the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is now the leader of the partitionist movement in Quebec .
he is spreading the idea everywhere , not just in Quebec , but outside the province too .
all this led provincial premiers to say " We must do something '' .
under the circumstances , the premiers decided to find a way to send a message to Quebec to the effect that they may be prepared to do something to please Quebeckers , because they do not want - and the Calgary exercise is primarily the result of this concern - the federalist party in Quebec , that is the Quebec Liberal Party , going into an election campaign with nothing but a promise to renew federalism and no concrete measures to support it .
so , the idea is to create the illusion that there will be a follow - up to this promise .
that is why the premiers took a piece of paper on which they wrote great principles .
the minister also talked about manpower training , which is a prime example of federalism at work , given that it took over 30 years to come up with a solution .
this administrative agreement may be short - lived , because we never know what the federal government may decide .
furthermore , we , as members of Parliament working in their ridings , know that the federal government is launching all kinds of youth training initiatives , but that it does not even respect the spirit or the lofty values by which it says it is guided .
it obviously has no interest in them whatsoever , nor in that agreement .
this is not a lofty principle , but a small administrative agreement to fool people into thinking that this system can evolve , can change .
but I do not want to look like the only one criticizing the Calgary declaration , so I am going to quote from a number of newspaper articles I have come across recently .
i will start with Lise Bissonnette of Le Devoir , who gives a bit of the context in which the Calgary declaration was arrived at , and I quote " It confirms , nonetheless , that the stumbling blocks of the past are still with us and are crystallizing into three points that have always been viewed as essential in Quebec circles that believe in the renewal of federalism '' .
and these three points are : the concept of political pact between two peoples , constitutional recognition of the distinct character of Quebec and its real significance , and the division of power between the two levels of government .
she goes on to explain that there has been failure on all three counts .
but I know that members opposite will say that Ms. Bissonnette is a nasty separatist , a sovereignist and whatnot .
i will therefore continue .
according to an article in Le Soleil , after a tour by the then premier of New Brunswick , Frank McKenna , the specific nature of Quebec was too much for the West to swallow .
frank McKenna said " I tried , but there was too much resistance in the West '' .
allow me to quote from this article :
it is normal , however , for Quebeckers to welcome this initiative with as much circumspection as the premiers put into formulating it .
Quebeckers , leery after the failures of recent years , are sceptical and want to know where all this is headed before they voice an opinion .
he continues :
the way the premiers started off this new round , there was nothing to stir up any enthusiasm .
in their palpable discomfort , their careful language , their way of paying lip service to their love , the nine premiers bore less resemblance to politicians beginning to rebuild their country and more to nine men in a waiting room waiting to be called in for vasectomies .
the author of this article is Alain Dubuc , senior editorial writer at La Presse .
he goes on to list a series of traps , concluding with this :
recognition and respect would be more credible and more than sufficient .
the text probably never made it to the Power Corporation office .
i have here another article headlined " Bones without flesh :
Jonathan Sauv 茅 urges his party to be wary of the Calgary declaration '' .
who is Jonathan Sauv 茅 ?
i hope he will stand by this statement during the provincial election .
" bones without flesh '' .
" the Calgary declaration : opening or setback ? '' .
there is also this document in which the Government of Newfoundland clarifies what is at stake , and the minister was quite clear on this , but I would like him to repeat this everywhere he goes .
why use the term " unique " instead of " distinct " to describe Quebec ' s character ?
the answer is found in this guide being distributed to the public .
the word " distinct " is reminiscent of earlier discussions .
in many parts of Canada , it has taken a negative meaning .
in addition , " distinct " conveys the idea of " separate '' , which goes against unity .
on the other hand , the expression " unique character " suggests something that is special but does not adversely affect unity .
accordingly , the expression " unique character " more accurately conveys what we mean .
these people want to play on words .
if they want to recognize Quebec for what it is , why do they feel the need to get into a semantics debate to decide what word to use , if not because there is a degree of distrust , fear , apprehension and hesitation in many places ?
Mr. Speaker , I know you are about to interrupt me , so I will conclude this part of my speech and then I will answer questions .
let me briefly touch on the motivation of the Reform Party , which calls on their constituents to make sure this never happens by way of a constitutional amendment recognizing Quebec ' s distinctiveness .
they are telling their supporters to express their views on this .
now their leader is saying that Senate reform should be included in there somewhere .
Preston Manning is looking for a way out and trying to put the blame on Quebeckers because they are not holding consultations .
that is what we are witnessing today and we will be discussing what their real intentions are throughout the day .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , it is hard to come up with a speech more deplorable than the one we have just heard on this subject .
choosing passages that suit the member from documents supporting the Calgary declaration in general terms -
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
talk about the 4 per cent in Alberta .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion :
he made no mention of scholarly papers like the one prepared by professor Beno 卯 t Pelletier explaining why the declaration is good for Quebeckers .
no , it is too long .
i have little to say .
i would like to point out some fairly elementary mistakes .
Mr. Pierre Brien :
Mr. Speaker , the minister says that I chose passages from people who support the Calgary declaration .
as far as I know , Alain Dubuc ' s editorial - I will send him a copy - contained little support for the Calgary declaration .
Ms. Bissonnette did not appear to be giving much support to the Calgary declaration .
Jonathan Sauv 茅 of the Liberal Party did not give it much support either .
i will send him a copy because I imagine he has some free time and that he will take the time to read it in between two speeches on separation .
as regards what is happening in Alberta and the fact that a number of people responded , I remember a report we heard on a CBC radio station .
that said , before we go calling that support , let us wait and see .
i suggest he be prudent , because he knows very well that , before it gets support in Alberta and B.C. , the Calgary declaration would have to be put to a referendum if it were to become a constitutional amendment .
then there would be a real debate , and I am sure that the minister and many members of his government would find the results most surprising .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member began and ended his remarks by saying that people in Quebec and the rest of Canada do not know what is in the Calgary declaration .
if that is the case , that is why we are recommending in point four of our motion that the government and members communicate with Quebeckers regarding the Calgary declaration and consult the people of Quebec on its contents .
we all know very well the hon. member ' s secessionist views .
what is he trying to hide from Quebeckers with respect to the content of the declaration ?
Mr. Pierre Brien :
yet , during these consultations in Quebec , more testimonies were heard than in the best consultation process under way on the Calgary declaration .
so , I hope they will reconsider , apologize and recognize that the process was in fact a great democratic exercise in Canada .
this being said , the ball is clearly in the federalist camp .
in the last referendum , 49.5 % of Quebeckers voted in favour of sovereignty , along with a partnership offer .
it is not true that Quebec will now support meaningless proposals that have no constitutional value and that are simply meant to gain support for Daniel Johnson in the next election .
federalists from all parties and from the other Canadian provinces should start by agreeing among themselves .
they should act while Quebec is still a province , because the countdown has begun .
let them agree on a substantial offer to Quebec and then we may have a debate .
otherwise , in the next referendum , people will have to choose between the insignificant Calgary declaration and its principles - some people even trivialized Quebeckers ' unique character by comparing it to Pacific salmon - and sovereignty with a partnership offer .
i am pretty sure which one of these two options will prevail .
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) :
one of the reasons for doing that is the need to show that in spite of differences which may exist from time to time on other issues , and indeed from time to time on the constitution , on the unity file , there is the possibility of coming together on this day in support of this resolution .
i hoped this would be a foreshadowing of future events in which we could come together around something more substantial , either the Calgary declaration as it stands or the Calgary declaration as amended or as followed up on in respect of other concerns that have been raised and will be raised in the course of the consultation .
the very nature of consultation , it seems to me , is that one is open , and I presume the premiers are open , to suggestions on how to approve the declaration or how to move beyond the declaration in ways that address very legitimate concerns that have been raised .
the first one that comes to my mind is the concern raised by the aboriginal leadership in this country , that there is wording in the Calgary declaration which , in their judgment , does not reflect properly their status within Canada , their self - understanding within Canada .
i and my party share their concerns .
they are not concerns that would lead us to vote against this motion because this motion is about the consultation process .
i note that even the Reform Party , whose members drafted this motion , are very careful not to indicate support for the Calgary declaration .
it could be intentional with good intentions .
on the other hand , it could be intentional with not so good intentions .
perhaps future speakers from the Reform Party could indicate the reason why .
it does not necessarily vitiate one ' s commitments to consultation to take a stand for oneself as to the worthiness or unworthiness of a particular resolution .
one can then go out , consult and find that there are legitimate criticisms , legitimate suggestions as to how it can be improved and how those suggestions can be acted upon .
i would be interested in knowing from future Reform Party speakers just where they stand on the Calgary declaration as opposed to all the language of support for the process .
it seems to me , again with respect to what has been said so far by the Reform Party in support of its motion , that much of what the first speaker said had to do with his insistence that the Government of Canada consult with the people of Quebec now , immediately , yesterday , on the Calgary declaration .
i listened to the minister say that he felt that the time was not right for that kind of consultation .
i tend to agree with the minister .
i say to the hon. member for Edmonton Strathcona that I think it would be a serious mistake to go into Quebec either through the instrument of the federal government or in some other way to create another round of expectations if we are not sure in the rest of Canada that we can actually say with a certain amount of unity and a certain amount of certainty that this is what we agreed upon .
at some point that has to happen , obviously .
if it were not to happen , then that would be a serious mistake .
when we reach that point , I do not think we should be fearful of the provincial government in this regard .
i think we have a right as Canadians and the federal government has a right as the federal government to consult Quebeckers on this issue .
i do not say this out of caution or out of fear of what the view of the Quebec government is on this .
some people may reject it , some people may accept it , but until we are in a position to do that , I think it might be a serious mistake to do what the hon. member has suggested .
i do not quarrel with the principle .
i suppose I am asking him to reflect on the timing .
maybe it is just because I have seen this happen before and I am worried that we may repeat the scenario of creating expectations which cannot be met .
having stated my reservations about what seems to be at the top of the Reform Party agenda , which is an immediate consultation with Quebec , I want to repeat that I doubt the wisdom of it at this time .
let us not get into the bind we were in before where because we have agreed on something that we cannot agree to change it .
we need to be able to agree to change things or to follow up so that we do not get into the corner we have been in so many times before , unfortunately , where we have not been able to respond appropriately to concerns that have arisen .
finally , from a social democratic or NDP point of view , we also say to the government though we do not offer a simplistic or economic reductionistic view of unity in this regard , we do however believe that part of building a strong country means addressing the growing social and economic inequalities that exist in this country and which are more pronounced now than they were 20 years ago .
we cannot encourage people to think as citizens , as a community or to think that they are all in the same boat if on the other hand we are pursing policies which increasingly divide and separate people into winners and losers and people who regard themselves as part of a society that no longer cares for them .
they cannot bring themselves to care for a society that does not care for them .
Mr. Ghislain Lebel ( Chambly , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate the last speaker .
this is a man who is asking himself some hard questions .
will the Calgary declaration , which I have only examined briefly , but which talks about the unique character of Quebec society , be accompanied by new inputs or amendments to the existing Constitution ?
if this notion of unique society were adopted in Quebec or elsewhere in Canada , has it been proposed to Quebeckers that this notion of Quebec ' s unique character be enshrined in legislation , which would be our new Constitution , and which would be accompanied by a change in the Senate , by a change in the division of legislative responsibilities , or whatever ?
i have heard nothing .
there is no doubt that Quebec is unique .
it is unique in speaking French .
it is unique in having its own poetry .
it is unique in many of its structures .
but I would like the hon. member to tell me whether , in Calgary or in the consultations now under way , proposals to Quebeckers were formulated .
Mr. Bill Blaikie :
my experience of this constitutional dilemma is that it is often not the technical legalities and not even the distribution of power that is at the root of the problem .
it is people ' s level of comfort or discomfort with certain ways of describing the country and describing Quebec ' s place within the country or describing the place of the aboriginal people in Canada and so on .
we are trying to find a way of talking to each other about ourselves that does not cause us to divide , that does not cause us to be in conflict with each other .
i see the Calgary declaration as one more attempt , because there have been so many unsuccessful ones , to find a way of talking about Canada in a way that meets the need in Quebec for both a symbolic and practical recognition of their distinctiveness but to do that in a way that does not offend against other images of the country and understandings of the country with respect to equality of the provinces and so on -
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
colleagues , with permission , when there is obviously a good deal of interest in joining the debate , if we could keep our comments and questions to about one minute and responses to a minute we would be able to get a lot more in .
questions and comments , the hon. Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs .
hon. St 茅 phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I want to say to the hon. member that I share most of his point of view .
our country has been in this debate for 30 years now .
though some people have some concerns it does not mean that they do not agree with the goal , with the objective which is to say which values we all share .
" this gradual approach , which is based on consultation and which includes the opposition parties , this desire not to set overly ambitious goals , shows that Canada has learned from its mistakes and wishes to put all the chances on its side so as to avoid another failure .
this is wise .
the Quebec minister responsible for Canadian intergovernmental affairs , Jacques Brassard , simply laughed off the suggestions of other provinces , showing clearly that his government is cutting itself off from the people of Quebec '' .
i quoted Alain Dubuc , whose remarks the member distorted earlier .
Mr. Bill Blaikie :
Mr. Speaker , what happened here to me points out what I have seen so many times and what I think is wrong .
i do not know whether the member was asking me a question or was debating with the Bloc Quebecois .
sometimes it is hard to tell .
one becomes the presumption or the platform for another family fight between Quebeckers .
they are all in the same family whether they like it or not .
these family fights are sometimes more vicious than the debate which goes on between the rest of Canada and Quebec .
i would simply ask Quebec members of Parliament , and Quebeckers whoever they might be , on whatever side they might be , to try to rise above this tendency to always be at each other ' s throats and try to take the rest of us into the debate because this is our country too .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand :
Mr. Speaker , before beginning and with your leave , I would like to seek the unanimous consent of the House to share my time with the hon. member for Brandon - Souris .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House ?
some hon. members :
agreed .
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand ( Richmond - Arthabaska , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , what is surprising today , is that we have a motion from the Reform Party , at a time when there is a process under way that seems to be going well , but it is not making headlines , and Reform is once again stirring up trouble on this issue .
when a process starts to work well , the Reform Party has to stir up trouble .
now , we have learned that the government side will join them , and also the New Democrats .
we of the Conservative Party will be voting against this motion for several reasons .
it harbours negative sentiments .
it comes from the Reform Party , and in the House they make themselves look good , and so on , but when we discuss with them outside the House , we realize that they want nothing to do with Quebec and francophones .
my colleague from Brandon - Souris will be speaking shortly on the real stance of the Reform Party on constitutional matters .
they are skillful in political and parliamentary manoeuvring in the House , but outside of the House , over a coffee or other refreshments , we get to see the other side of the Reform Party , and now people will know what the Reform really stands for .
we cannot agree with this .
the leader of a party cannot take on a new image within six months .
during the election campaign , we saw what the Reform Party stood for .
that same outlook is still here today , and the party structure is the same .
we are against this motion .
it is not the time for such a motion .
in fact , the government will most likely borrow from this position during coming meetings .
we do not agree with this either and we are very surprised that the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , the minister who creates havoc each time the Constitution is mentioned , supports this proposal .
he and his counterpart in Quebec are firing off letters to each other .
they are writing an essay on federal - provincial non - relations , on how to ensure that these relations will not work .
now we are getting ready to go to the supreme court for a real bout of legal and constitutional squabbling .
could we not come back to the basic principle of dialogue and action ?
we want a federalism that is efficient and sensitive .
other solutions can be found .
we are ready to share these and to discuss them .
let us not attempt however to go to Quebec to talk about the Calgary process .
Quebeckers are capable of reading and understanding what it is about .
i would like the Bloc Quebecois member who spoke earlier about the national commissions on Quebec ' s future to know that I was a commissioner .
on constitutional matters , such as the Calgary declaration or the Meech Lake accord , ask Quebeckers to name the five conditions of the Meech Lake accord and few could do so .
what they understand is that an attempt was made to keep the country together .
so , we can let the Calgary process take its course .
in the meantime , let us try to give this country some real solutions .
we are prepared to share our ideas , as I said earlier , including the Canadian pact .
what is it ?
it involves - and the people in the Bloc Quebecois will be happy and we agree with them - respect for individual jurisdictions and an end to overlap and duplication .
our government is a centralizing government forever shoving its nose in others ' business .
the Reform Party now wants municipalities to come under the federal government .
this is a real mess .
what we are saying is that , without a constitutional amendment - as our leader often points out - we can talk , meet others ' standards and respect their jurisdictions , come to mutual agreements and , under the British parliamentary system , establish traditions that go on to become law .
so let us try to get back to the real priorities .
the Reform Party tabled a motion this morning because they want to screw the whole thing up .
they want to stop it from working .
that is where the problem lies .
talk to Reformers , talk to certain MPs and their staff outside the House , and they will tell you that , for them , Canada means no Quebec , no francophones , no multiculturalism , no official languages .
that is what the Reform Party is all about .
just look at their web site .
the Reform web site is not even bilingual .
close to 50 % of them are bilingual , and they want to be a national party .
forget it , it just will not work .
what we are proposing is to sit down together , respect jurisdictions , and make the country work on an administrative basis .
let us get back to bread and butter issues .
people will not be able to explain what the Calgary declaration is , or what Meech Lake is , if they have no bread on the table .
now I will give the floor over to my colleague from Brandon - Souris .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , first of all I would like to remind my Conservative Party colleague that the Meech Lake accord is not something I was promoting .
when people voted in the 1995 referendum , they knew what they were deciding on .
he himself says that he was a member of the commission on the future , which discussed the matter thoroughly .
i would like to ask him a question concerning a letter written by his leader on the eve of the Calgary meeting .
the letter states " As I have pointed out , a successful meeting would include - and here he names things - a draft definition of an action plan for Canada .
the statement could set out the following points : the need to rebalance the roles and responsibilities of the federal and provincial governments '' .
he also speaks of spending power .
he says " The measures limiting this power should focus on the long term common good '' .
he speaks of a reform of institutions that ought to include an indispensable reform of the Senate .
i repeat the first phrase : " A successful meeting would include the following '' .
is the hon. member in agreement with his leader , then , and can he conclude , as he must , that the Calgary meeting was a failure ?
Mr. Andr 茅 Bachand :
Mr. Speaker , yes , I am in agreement with my leader .
i campaigned with my leader because that is what I believed in .
this letter basically repeats what was in our election platform .
the Calgary process is one that will hopefully evolve .
as for the statements the Bloc Quebecois member attributed to my leader , yes , I am in agreement .
if we could implement the points the member has quoted from the letter by the member for Sherbrooke , I think the country would perhaps be in better shape .
the Bloc member knows very well that the position of my leader , the position of the Conservative Party in Quebec , is one of the most popular positions and one which has the potential to rally all Quebeckers .
this is something the Bloc member knows , and that is why they do not want us to gain too much power in Quebec because they know that the next time they will be out the door .
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank my colleague from Quebec for sharing his speaking time for a member and a colleague from western Canada to speak to an issue I consider to be of utmost national significance .
i am pleased to be in this House to see the transformation from a cocoon to a butterfly of the Reform Party .
it is now putting forward its position on national unity .
a short six months ago the positions taken with respect to national unity by hon. colleagues from the Reform Party were not quite as positive as the position now being put forward in this House .
it is no secret that the Progressive Conservative Party believes very strongly in the federation of Canada .
it believes very strongly in ten provinces and two territories .
it believes this country has everywhere to go in the future to ensure we embrace the national unity of the federation and to make sure we have ten solid provinces and two solid territories .
i can speak to the experience and the confidence of the leader of our party .
it was the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party who brought this country back from the abyss .
in the last referendum he was called upon because there was no leadership from the Liberal government .
he was called upon to make sure this country did stay together .
there is a majority in Quebec that wants to remain Canadian and it will do so .
the policy of the Progressive Conservative Party has always been one of consultation , conciliation and understanding unlike the policies of the Reform Party .
the Calgary declaration is embraced and accepted by the Progressive Conservative Party .
it is nice to see there is leadership in this country beyond that of the federal Liberal government which has not given any indication of leadership .
the premiers of the provinces had to sit down to put forward a plan , the Calgary declaration .
they had to come forward to say that this question is of such importance we have to deal with it ourselves without the leadership of the federal Liberal government .
i am thankful for the Calgary declaration which we embrace and I thank the premiers .
i will discuss the Jekyll and Hyde transformation of the Reform Party .
a short six months ago during the election campaign the Reformers stated quite emphatically that Quebeckers do not know how to solve the unity crisis .
i would like to know the motivation behind this particular motion .
i would also like to discuss distinct society and unique society .
all of a sudden it seems that Reform members have this wonderful transformation and unique society is something they can accept .
i fought in the trenches during the last election campaign and I can say that distinct society was a major issue .
it was an issue which the Reformers used as a cheap political trick to push hot buttons in western Canada .
i would like to remind the House of the motives -
an hon. member :
did you support it ?
Mr. Rick Borotsik :
yes , I supported distinct society and I do now .
in fact , Quebec is distinct .
it is very distinct and unique , as are all provinces of this country very distinct and unique .
there are no special powers but they are distinctive nonetheless .
we accept bilingualism .
we accept the fact that they speak a different language .
we accept the fact that there is distinctiveness in Quebec .
i would like to bring to the attention of the House an ad campaign during the last election .
this is the same party which now wants to consult with Quebeckers about the types of leadership we should have in this country ?
i think not .
i do not believe the motives of the Reform Party .
i have some serious concerns about them .
as a matter of fact , a high level staffer in the Reform Party issued in the Calgary Sun of October 30 ten different resolutions , one which suggested " Eliminate bilingualism and multiculturalism .
with Quebec gone the rationale for bilingualism and multiculturalism would go too '' .
to me this does not speak of a resolution put forward for consultation -
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order .
the hon. member has cited an article dated October 30 .
i wonder if he could cite the year and table the document .
the Deputy Speaker :
Mr. Rick Borotsik :
Mr. Speaker , I would be more than happy to have this document passed on to the hon. member .
it is an article from the Calgary Sun dated October 30 , 1995 .
Mr. Jason Kenney :
oh , all right .
Mr. Rick Borotsik :
i see .
things have changed quite dramatically since 1995 .
the motives I am afraid are not acceptable to the Progressive Conservative Party and our members will not be supporting the resolution put forward by the Reform Party .
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I find it unfortunate that the Tory caucus will not be co - operating with this kind of initiative , as will the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party .
it seems that once again the Tories are joining their old separatist allies , the people who kept them in power for nine years , people like Lucien Bouchard .
if that party is so strongly in favour of national unity , then why did it have card carrying members of the Parti Quebecois running for it in the last federal election ?
is that its degree of commitment ?
if the leader of the Tory party is the great hero of the last referendum , why did he lose his own riding to the oui side in the last referendum ?
what is it that the hon. member objects to ?
the advertisement to which he referred said that it is time for all Canadians to have a voice in the national unity debate .
that is exactly what we are calling for today .
by opposing this motion are they opposed to giving all Canadians a voice on that debate ?
are they satisfied with the failure of the former Tory , Premier Bouchard ' s government ' s failure to let Quebeckers have a say on this issue ?
why not let Quebeckers speak to the Calgary declaration ?
does the member not understand that the unique characteristics clause in the Calgary declaration is a non - justiciable , non - interpretive clause which is qualified by the equality provisions riddled throughout that declaration which were entirely absent from the failed Charlottetown and Meech accords imposed by the top down Mulroney government ?
Mr. Rick Borotsik :
Mr. Speaker , once again the rhetoric coming from the hon. member for Calgary Southeast is rather enjoyable .
i am sure the hon. member realizes that from a unity perspective the Progressive Conservative government had a much better understanding of the Quebec issues than does the Reform Party .
as for consultation , we have always said that the consultative process is a keystone of bringing Quebeckers into the federation of Canada .
no one province is more equal than another province .
we recognize in our own policy that all provinces have to work together to make the federation stronger .
we do not believe in divisiveness .
we do not believe in intimidation .
Mr. Peter Goldring ( Edmonton East , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time today with my colleague for Prince George - Bulkley Valley .
i am pleased to stand in support of the Calgary declaration which frameworks a national dialogue on Canadian unity .
we have come a long way in the two years since the referendum .
two years ago in the referendum we were told not to talk , not to discuss , and to stay out of the situation .
i am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in favour of this important motion for two reasons .
first , I indicate my support and that of my constituents for a strong and united Canada that is a welcoming home for the people of Quebec as well as all Canadians .
second , I hope to teach the government a bit of humility .
why humility ?
it is for one simple reason .
if our country is to be saved it will not be by the government .
it will not be by the plans of the Prime Minister or the letters of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs or the strategies of public servants who only a few short years ago were the architects of the Charlottetown accord .
the sooner the government accepts a bit of humility , the sooner the real work can begin .
the people of Canada will save Canada , the men and women who love the country and make it work every day through their work and their faith ; the 150,000 people who flooded into Montreal during the referendum campaign to demonstrate their love of country ; and the many millions at home who held their breath during the voting .
Canadian unity hit absolute bottom that day .
as I have said in the past , if Canadians have the will and determination we can resolve federal and provincial concerns .
we can resolve aboriginal concerns .
we can resolve language concerns .
it will be an expression of popular will and not a master plan of political manipulation that will make the difference .
the grassroots will prevail .
this is a lesson that the nine premiers and two territorial leaders took to heart three months ago when they framed the Calgary declaration .
every province and territory , with the exception of Quebec , has put in place a consultative mechanism so its citizens can have their say on the principles of the Calgary declaration and the future of their country .
this is a very important step .
through the motion we can urge the House to endorse efforts to encourage consultation .
as parliamentarians we must use our good offices to encourage our constituents to participate in the provincial consultation processes .
the Calgary declaration has some advantages over previous efforts to renew the federation .
we should be working to ensure its success .
it has the advantage of having come from the premiers and not from Ottawa , which will give it some added credibility in the eyes of many Canadians who remember the top down executive federalism that produced the Meech and Charlottetown accords .
discussions involve the people of Canada and will have their direct input .
it has the advantage of not being a fait accompli .
instead it signals the flexibility of the federal system in which provinces have the freedom to exercise their powers in the way it best suits their traditions and character .
i had the pleasure to appear at a town hall discussion hosted jointly by my provincial elected colleagues .
our open forum discussions touched on many topics but encouraged all to send their ideas and concepts to the Alberta legislature .
the declaration is suggesting for consideration a way of breaking the deadlock that the phrase distinct society has created , rightly or wrongly , by polarizing opinion on whether Quebec should have a special status in Confederation .
distinct society was undefined .
unique has equality qualifications .
the Calgary declaration recognizes the unique character of Quebec ' s society , including its French speaking majority , its culture and tradition , the civil law and the role that the Quebec government and legislature have in protecting and developing this unique character within Canada .
it also recognizes the legitimate aspirations of all provinces , the equality of their status in Confederation and the fairness of ensuring that any powers offered in a future constitutional amendment to one province be available to all .
i believe Canada is blessed by the uniqueness of many areas .
in short , the Calgary declaration recognizes reality .
that is what makes it so regrettable that the Bloc Quebecois and provincial government have not consulted Quebeckers on this important dialogue .
the Calgary declaration emphasizes equality of people , equality of provinces and equality of powers .
if one province is conferred powers , they ought to be available to all .
we ask all hon. members to recognize their responsibilities as parliamentarians and to speak out in favour of a strong and united Canada .
in closing , let me reiterate my support for the motion as a member of Parliament , as an Albertan and as a Canadian .
it is my sincere hope that members of the government party will see the wisdom of putting their energy and enthusiasm behind the success of a Calgary initiative that does so much to encourage dialogue with all and of voting for the motion .
it is my hope members of the Bloc Quebecois will act in the best interest of all Quebeckers and will urge their masters in Quebec City to let their constituents have their say .
all Canadians must have the opportunity to speak out on the unity of our great country .
i move :
that the motion be amended by inserting immediately after the words " equality of citizens and provinces " the following :
" and special status for none '' .
the Deputy Speaker :
the Chair will take the amendment under advisement for the moment .
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , during the last election campaign , Reformers said that Quebeckers were not worthy to run the country .
when I hear that and read motions such as this one saying that the Reform Party has made a 180 degree turn , I cannot accept this , or the fact that they are undermining national unity .
they seem to come up with arguments valid only for the day they are used .
they are not speaking for the good of Canada as a whole .
Mr. Peter Goldring :
Mr. Speaker , I am not sure to what the hon. member was alluding .
i can only speak most assuredly for myself .
i am standing in the Chamber as a result of the last referendum .
i was in Quebec City visiting and I saw the voting going on .
it was on a plane coming back to Edmonton that I resolved to seek out political parties on the work they were doing for national unity .
i had discussions with several parties and the one plan I wholeheartedly agreed with that supported national unity was that of the Reform Party .
Mr. Pierre Brien ( T 茅 miscamingue , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am going to step into this disagreement between Conservative and Reform Party colleagues .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
it ' s all one family .
Mr. Pierre Brien :
so it is .
we were criticized for the same thing earlier , but we can see that there is a family quarrel of much greater magnitude in that corner of the House .
i would like him to explain to me how they can teach us anything about democratic spirit , when we know that there have been three referendums in Quebec in 15 years , that various forms of consultation were held on the constitutional issue , that we engaged in the highly democratic exercise of referendums .
why does he not share the view of his NDP colleague that the ball is clearly in the federalists ' court and that they should first of all agree among themselves on what they can offer Quebeckers ?
the first step before any consultation of Quebeckers is to agree among themselves on what they can offer .
why does he not share the opinion of his NDP colleague on this issue ?
Mr. Peter Goldring :
Mr. Speaker , I believe in the Reform Party position on consultation .
it is a grassroots position .
there is more truth and intelligence coming through from the people of Canada than we have seen .
i also stand to repeat that the referendum of two years ago was the result of 35 years of mismanagement by a revolving door of political parties in Ottawa which brought us to that abyss , which brought us and national unity to rock bottom .
that was management by federal parties .
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to join in the debate on the resolution .
we in the Chamber are talking about something that is a priority or should be a priority to the House of Commons , the unity of our country .
there is a tremendous difference in the approach and the definition the Reform Party gives to the word unity and the approach and the definition the Tories , the Liberals and the separatists give to the word unity .
for the three parties , the Tories , the Liberals and the separatists , the word unity is all about politics and political power .
the difference between them and us is that the word unity means bringing our country together , a united Canada , where the people of Canada have a say in the future of this country .
it is not about politics .
it is not about the Tory politics where under the regime of Brian Mulroney he brought separatists into his party simply for political power .
it is not about the politics of the Bloc members who have , through their snake oil salesmen , convinced so many people in Quebec that there is some sort of a nirvana out there if they can form their own nation .
it is not about the politics of the Liberal Party seeking to re - establish its political roots it lost in Quebec .
to us it is about unity and uniting this country , uniting the grassroots of this country into a belief that this country can be better strengthened by the unity of all peoples under one flag , one nation , one people .
that is the difference .
their arguments are just beyond belief because we know the agenda behind their arguments .
in particular , we endorse the philosophy and belief in that Calgary declaration process that the most important people and the most important factor in this whole unity debate is the input that comes from the ordinary Canadian citizens who love this country .
that is one of the things that has been left out of this discussion for over 30 years .
the Liberals have left it out and the Tories have left it out .
they prefer to make their master plan for this country in the backrooms with their political strategists .
that is what is wrong and why the Meech Lake accord failed and the Charlottetown accord failed .
they never went to the people and consulted them .
that is the difference between what the Calgary declaration is attempting to do and the failed attempts of the Mulroney Tories and the failed attempts of the Liberals who joined together under the Charlottetown accord saying this was a great plan for our country .
that is why it has failed .
the NDP also supported that .
it failed because they did not go to the people first and find out what the people thought .
there is an idea that this idea by the Reform Party of bringing the people of Canada into this debate is nonsense , this idea from the Tories , the Liberals and the Bloc .
we are seeking to develop a plan that has some credibility and that can only be accomplished when we go to the people .
the political parties that sat in this House in the past have no credibility when it comes to designing a unity plan .
we have seen this over the last 30 years .
they have failed .
they prefer to carry on the family fight between Quebec Liberals and separatists and the Tories and the separatists for political power within the province of Quebec , seeing who can outdo each other , not caring one whit for the unity of this country but more for the political power they could get out of the appeasement policies .
the important thing about the Calgary declaration that we want to establish in this debate is that it was initiated outside of Ottawa .
it was initiated by the premiers and the territorial leaders .
it was a plan that would involve the people of Canada and bring them into this consensus gathering as to how we are going to get this country together .
it is time for Canadians to show the politicians how Canada should work , not the politicians to tell the Canadian people how this unity thing should work .
i call on all Canadians in this debate , as we will today , to make their opinions known , to attend the unity meetings across the country .
this is something the Tories did not allow under Brian Mulroney , something they did not allow under the Charlottetown accord and something the separatists would never even consider .
they would prefer to have their slick talking leaders carry on this dream of a wonderful nation that can survive and exist without the rest of Canada , which they know is a lie .
the Calgary declaration is not a done deal .
it is merely a start of a process that can possibly lead to a solution to our unity crisis .
therefore there are important interests that we want to consider .
why ?
this just creates problems .
it has created problems for 30 years and we see it in the House today , as the Quebec Liberals and the separatists banter back and forth .
we see it as the Tories join in the conversation .
we cannot have one province holding a position that is higher than the other provinces .
i do not care which province they are talking about , whether it is my home province of British Columbia , Alberta , Saskatchewan or Quebec . No status that is not equal , it cannot happen .
no one wants to live in a second class province .
no Canadian should have rights that are not enjoyed by other Canadians and no equality simply increases regional resentment and national division .
without equality we cannot have a collective , united feeling about our country .
while the Tories , the Liberals and the separatists would prefer to talk about what is best on a regional type basis , the Reform Party wants to talk about equality where all regions in the country , all provinces and all people live together on an equal basis under that wonderful Canadian flag that adorns this House .
equality also means an end to domineering federalism .
we in the Reform Party have talked about devolution of powers , getting rid of this big central government which dictates to the provinces in areas where it should not even be involved .
yes , we talk about passing powers down to the province of Quebec that it should handle itself .
at the same time , we talk about passing those same powers down to the other provinces .
i cannot believe that the separatists here , when we are talking about the transfer of powers into areas the federal government should not be in , on to their province , would not be in favour of that .
yet they are not because it does not fit with the big lie that they have been telling the people of Quebec .
the Liberal members opposite laugh when we talk about unity .
it does not fit into their philosophy .
they are more interested in politics , as I stated earlier .
i ask the members to support this resolution and let us begin another step toward the unity of this country .
Mr. Clifford Lincoln ( Lac - Saint - Louis , Lib . ) :
no one is to be trusted except the Reform Party which , by some sort of magic , has the perfect formula for unity .
he accuses us , in his own words , of not caring one whit about Canadian unity .
i find this very offensive .
i find it extremely offensive that we get told by the Reform Party that all of us here do not care one whit for Canadian unity , as if they have the golden message , the true faith , they are the people who have the answers for everything else and everybody else is wrong .
the hon. member accuses the Liberal Party of not having carried out consultations during Charlottetown .
he had better check his files .
i really think the Reform Party in trying to push its motion , which has a lot of good in it , should really try to involve all of us if it really cares for unity , rather than just saying " we have the perfect message and all of you , a curse on your houses '' .
i think that is a very sad message coming from the Reform Party .
Mr. Dick Harris :
Mr. Speaker , if the hon. member had been listening I pointed out that given the dismal failure of the Liberals and the Tories and the NDP who joined with them over the last 30 years in trying to bring this country together , and they have failed , they have lost the trust of Canadians and they have to start to earn that again .
that first step starts with involving the people of Canada in this process which they have never done in the past .
i would point out that during the failed Charlottetown accord the Liberal joined with the Tories and the NDP to try to sell that Charlottetown accord to the Canadian people , a process getting to that accord that did not involve the Canadian people .
sure , there was a dog and pony show going across the country with hand selected witnesses to give their input , but the average Canadian was left out and that is why they voted against the Charlottetown accord .
Mr. Jean - Paul Marchand ( Qu 茅 bec East , BQ ) :
in fact , it would not make any difference if they were members of the Conservative Party or the NDP ; the bottom line is that they argue , but they all agree on one thing : to put forward proposal like the Calgary declaration , in which there is nothing but empty words , that has no political weight whatsoever and ignores the legitimate and justifiable demands Quebec has been making for 30 years .
Mr. Dick Harris :
i am a Canadian and I love this country .
if anyone should apologize it should be this separatist member who sits there and refuses to acknowledge that Canadian flag , refuses to sing the national anthem of this country in this House and day after day preaches the breaking up of this country .
if anyone should apologize it should be that separatist member there .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel ( Secretary of State ( Science , Research and Development ) ( Western Economic Diversification ) , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to take part in this debate today , but before I begin , I wish to inform you of something .
i will be sharing my time with my colleague from Waterloo - Wellington .
it is really quite tempting to raise a number of the issues that were addressed by the last speaker from the Reform Party .
i am extremely surprised and disappointed at the comments that were made .
there was a comment that Quebec could not make it alone .
what a wonderful way to start a dialogue .
there were comments such as " a dog and pony show " that ridiculed the efforts of Canadians and their elected representatives to try to understand and to find solutions .
there were other comments too numerous to mention .
i am tempted to talk about issues such as what was mentioned in the last campaign , that no Quebecker should ever again be prime minister .
i am tempted - I am looking for some divine help - to talk about double talk , the comment about Stornoway and what happened , but I shall resist temptation .
i want to address the Reform member ' s proposal , which I find pretty reasonable , perfectly reasonable in fact .
perhaps this is due to the fact that he is new and others around him have not had the chance to socialize with him so far .
he came up with a perfectly reasonable proposal , as far as I am concerned , and he wants to promote consultation with Canadians across the country .
i applaud this approach .
one of them has just stated that there was nothing accomplished over the last 30 years .
another claims that his party is the only one that can make a contribution .
still another has made comments that are unworthy of this House .
nevertheless , the proposal we are discussing today should be supported .
it should be supported because it refers to consultations with Canadians across the country .
what I would like very much to know is the position of this political party and also of each political party on the Calgary declaration .
is it to early to decide on this issue ?
it is not too early however to tell others what they should be doing .
i would like to say a few words on this today .
so obviously , our political parties differ , even if we agree more or less on the proposal that we are discussing today .
there are a great number of differences on immigration , the role of aboriginal peoples in Canada , bilingualism and many other things .
i could talk a lot longer on this , but the point to remember is that there are great differences , in all areas , and these will never disappear .
the meeting of Canada ' s premiers called for public consultations .
this declaration is a good starting point for creating understanding about our country , about the needs of each region , and , of course , about the needs of Quebeckers .
the Calgary declaration has the support of a great number of people throughout the country .
it is true that there are people who are completely against it , and that is understandable .
but many responsible people endorse this declaration .
it is important that the public discuss this proposal and talk about Canada , and that people gain a greater understanding of each province and territory , and , of course , of Quebec , which is often not well understood .
consultations are necessary because they might go beyond that in terms of creating a greater of understanding of who we are as a community .
i am speaking about all the communities within the country .
i believe they can promote pride .
we may come to realize that we must work more closely together to be stronger and more receptive to our various needs as citizens of a specific province , or as members of a specific linguistic , religious or cultural group .
i will now talk about certain principles .
i will begin with equality .
let me share with you what a Canadian citizen told me .
he said " This is a principle with which we cannot disagree , a principle recognized in section 15 of the 1982 Constitution Act .
it is clearly stated that all Canadians are equal , regardless of sex , race , religion , social status or wealth .
to state such a principle is in itself sufficient to demonstrate its validity '' .
some political parties - and , as I said earlier , I will try to restrain myself - will use something like the principle of equality to make other claims .
the fact is that it has been in Canadian law for a very long time .
the question is whether the principle is always applied fairly .
we could probably find examples where it was not the case , but let us look at the big picture .
let us look at the equality of provinces .
there is but one legal status for the provinces .
there are not six .
a province is a province .
none can pull rank on the others .
we know that .
though equal they are nonetheless different , with their own economic , social , cultural and historical characteristics .
though equal the provinces are nevertheless differentiated from one another .
that is what some people misunderstand .
as they do so they tear up the country .
they are guilty of tearing up this country .
this country , which has supposedly done nothing for the last 30 , 40 , 50 years , is the envy of the world .
it is number one on virtually everyone ' s list .
millions of people have come to it as quickly as they could .
let us talk about other principles .
let us talk about diversity , tolerance , compassion and equal opportunities .
some hon. members :
oh , oh !
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel :
this is what is not understood by a number of political parties , including the members who are yelling .
again , the declaration states that respect for diversity and equality underlies unity , but equality does not mean uniformity .
to reconcile the principle of equality with the great value of diversity , Canada can count on a political system which , thanks to its flexibility , promotes the enrichment of our collective heritage .
no other example better illustrates this reality than the recognition of Quebec ' s unique character .
but what is this unique character ?
an hon. member :
these are just words .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel :
i heard someone say that these are just words .
it is unfortunate that the member cannot read and understand the declaration .
Mr. Jean - Paul Marchand :
explain that .
an hon. member :
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel :
yes , one person only .
let us take one person in one province only and let us pretend he knows the truth .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
the Premier of Ontario .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel :
oh , what an effort you are making to understand .
Mr. Yves Rocheleau :
give us details .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel :
what an effort you are making to show how openminded you are , dear colleague .
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur :
the premier in Toronto understood .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel :
but allow me to continue .
" in Canada ' s federal system '' - and I will end on that point - `` where respect for diversity and equality underlies unity , the unique character of Quebec society , including its French - speaking majority , its culture and its tradition of civil law , is fundamental to the well - being of Canada '' .
i could go on , but unfortunately I am being interrupted .
how undemocratic , don ' t you think ?
the Deputy Speaker :
order , please .
before going to questions and comments , I wish to inform the House that I have considered the amendment moved by the hon. member for Edmonton East , and I declare that it is in order .
debate is on the amendment , therefore .
the hon. member for Chicoutimi , for a comment or a question .
Mr. Andr 茅 Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) :
Mr. Speaker , I will be brief .
i think this debate clearly shows that as politicians we all have a professional interest in constitutional matters .
we have not always made a very positive contribution .
on the contrary , past failures can rarely be blamed on the citizens we represent , while , in many instances , politicians displayed a lack of responsibility for which we are still paying .
i am very surprised .
i hope that the Liberal Party of Canada is in caucus , because its position is rather hard to understand : to accept and support a motion moved by a party with a not so glorious past , asking that we communicate with Quebeckers and consult them on something that is really incomplete .
while realizing that it is not good to dwell on the past , opportunities must always be sought to give people a chance to change their minds .
but when we read what Preston Manning has written - the man who once said in passing , at the time of the Meech Lake failure : " I wish one of the western premiers would deliver the deathblow to the accord '' - it is hard to conceive that he could change his position so quickly .
given all the recent negative publicity about politicians in Quebec , it is asking a lot to support today ' s motion , which urges the government to consult Quebeckers .
the Liberal Party endorses a motion which is pure provocation for all our fellow citizens in Quebec and for all French - Canadians .
i wonder if my hon. colleague from the Liberal Party would support the withdrawal of the Reform Party motion out of respect for all Quebeckers and all French - Canadians , until such time as , hopefully , a proposal can be put forward that is substantial , takes into account Quebec ' s historical demands and stands a chance of gaining wide support .
if my hon. colleague could kindly tell us what he thinks of this idea , because the course we are on today is a collision course , which , far from helping the debate , is making it worse .
once again , it would be irresponsible for us as politicians to fast track something without being properly informed .
hon. Ronald J . Duhamel :
Mr. Speaker , I think everyone , including my colleagues from Quebec , know that I have enormous respect for Quebec . I always have .
both I and my colleagues have respect .
what is happening today ?
it is true that the party that moved this motion does not have a glorious past on this issue .
but there are members of this party who are trying .
trying to do what ?
why not give a chance to this new member , who could perhaps enlighten some of his colleagues who are not so enlightened , if we are to judge by the speeches today .
we are talking about consultations .
we support the consultation and we support Quebec ' s unique character .
this is the party that introduced the motion we voted on in support of Quebec ' s distinct nature .
have people forgotten that ?
this is the party that did so .
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) :
Mr. Speaker , I am happy to rise today before this House to give my views on this very important motion introduced by my colleague from Edmonton - Strathcona .
there is no more important issue than the unity of Canada .
we on this side of the House confirmed this view in the Speech from the Throne earlier this fall by identifying national unity as our highest priority .
as we all know , the premiers of nine provinces as well as two territorial leaders met on September 14 to discuss a framework for consulting the population about strengthening the Canadian federation .
what resulted was the Calgary declaration .
the Calgary principles and consultations are a gesture of goodwill toward all Canadians including Quebeckers , aboriginal peoples and our linguistic minorities .
while the declaration is not a legal draft nor a proposal for a constitutional amendment , we believe it is an important step in the right direction .
it is an invitation extended by 11 provincial and territorial governments to all Canadians and all regions to reflect on and engage in a new discussion about the values we share as Canadians .
we also hope that the Calgary principles will lead us to a consensus on the core values of our country including respect for the unique character of Quebec .
we on the government side endorse the principles of the premiers , the territorial leaders and all Canadians to foster national unity .
further we fully support the consultation process begun by those premiers and territorial leaders .
the Calgary principles are the work of the premiers and the territorial leaders .
the federal government was not a participant at the Calgary meeting and is not a major participant in the current provincial and territorial consultation procedures .
that being said however , I do intend to do what I can to promote positive public debate on this very important issue , the Calgary principles , both in my own province and across the country .
we recognize the Calgary initiative was undertaken in part because of the interest of the nine premiers and the territorial leaders in consulting their own populations to create a better working environment .
while they are at various stages , consultations on the Calgary principles are well under way in those nine provinces and the territories .
we on this side of the House urge Canadians to become involved in this very important consultation process .
we urge them to express their opinion or to suggest possible improvements to the principles as outlined .
why is it that the separatist government in Quebec will not consult Quebeckers on these principles ?
let me be specific on each of the seven principles as outlined by the premiers and the territorial leaders in the Calgary declaration .
first , the equality of citizens .
all Canadians are equal and have rights protected by law .
this principle is entrenched in section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
this means that all Canadians irrespective of sex , race , religion , social or economic status are equal before the law .
but equality is not the same as uniformity .
in a democracy like ours , equality and freedom go hand in hand .
nothing forces us to have the same beliefs or preferences as anybody else .
we all have the right to be different .
in other words all the children in the family are equal but that does not mean we are all the same .
that is why the Constitution itself in section 36 of the Constitution Act , 1982 commits all governments in Canada to the promotion of equal opportunities for the well - being of all Canadians .
it is why various sections of the Constitution recognize aboriginal and treaty rights of our aboriginal peoples as well as the rights enjoyed by our linguistic minorities .
second , the equality of the provinces .
we believe that the principle of equality that applies to individuals also applies to the provinces .
it is our view that all provinces have equality of status .
none is set above the others and all have the same fundamental legal relationship with the people who live there .
having said that , their equality of status does not mean that they cannot be different one from the other .
as is the case for all individual Canadians , provincial equality does not mean provincial uniformity .
each and every province deserves equal consideration but each province has its own needs which vary depending on circumstances .
this is how our federal system makes room for differences and avoids locking the provinces into a rigid structure that would make it impossible for them to respond to their own special needs .
third , diversity , tolerance , compassion and equality of opportunity .
the history of Canada has been marked by genuine openness to differences and by a generous spirit of tolerance .
while every country has its weaknesses , circumstances have led us in Canada to develop greater respect for the diverse backgrounds of all our citizens .
our spirit of partnership and compassion has inspired our federal and provincial governments to create social programs that are the envy of the world and which attest to our desire to work in partnership to give equal chances to everyone and our compassion for the neediest among us .
that is very important .
fourth , our national identity is enriched by the contributions of our aboriginal peoples , the vitality of the English and French languages and the multicultural character of Canada .
like the Calgary declaration and the more recent statements released by the premiers and leaders , the Speech from the Throne recognizes the invaluable contribution of the aboriginal peoples to the building of Canada and the richness of our identity .
we and the aboriginal peoples must work together to respond to the challenges they face .
canada ' s two official languages are another of our country ' s riches .
linguistic duality and the viability of both official language communities in all parts of the country are part and parcel of our great identity .
one of the strengths of Canada , our official languages are two of the languages in greatest use worldwide .
they contribute substantially to Canada ' s success economically , socially , culturally and internationally .
the multicultural character of Canada is a source of national pride and enrichment as well as being a universal ideal .
fifth , the unique character of Quebec society .
our recognition of the linguistic and cultural differences of Quebec addresses its unique needs and circumstances and is in keeping with the equality of the provinces and of individual Canadians .
that is why Parliament has adopted a resolution recognizing these differences .
this recognition of Quebec is a positive message to Quebeckers who want to be part of the great Canadian family .
it demonstrates to Quebeckers that the rest of Canada does accept them and respects their right to be different .
it is also linked with the core Canadian values which Calgary underscored , that Canadians share with their fellow citizens in Quebec : the values of respect , partnership , fairness , justice and openness .
sixth , if any future constitutional amendment confers powers on one province , these powers must be available to all provinces .
while the Calgary declaration does not call for any amendments in or additions to the division of powers among the governments , in the event that such an amendment were contemplated , then the equality of provinces would apply .
we believe that all provinces must have the same tools available to them to promote their own development .
any tool available to one province must meet its specific needs and must be available to all others .
seventh , greater partnership among the two levels of government while respecting each other ' s jurisdiction .
this is what the seventh principle states .
we can all agree that the vast majority of Canadians want their provincial and federal governments to act in the common interest of all and build a true Canadian partnership based on solidarity and respect for our diversity and for areas of federal and provincial jurisdiction .
the federal government has been working very hard to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the federation by emphasizing consultation and collaboration .
the list of all the areas on which the federal and provincial governments are collaborating is long .
to name a couple , they include labour market training and federal - provincial talks .
to conclude , I would like to say that the federal government recognizes that our country is constantly changing .
this is the reality of the Canadian community .
it is also a fact that we must change if we are going to survive as a society .
as members can see , the consultative process and the seven principles set out in Calgary are critically important to the unity of Canada .
there is nothing more important than keeping Canada together and the motion put before the House today is useful in achieving this objective .
canada ' s past was remarkable , its future will be even more so .
Mr. Jean - Paul Marchand ( Qu 茅 bec East , BQ ) :
Mr. Speaker , I greatly appreciated my colleague ' s speech .
it was polite and eloquent but it meant nothing .
i would suggest , if he has the time , that he read a book by a journalist at The Globe and Mail , Ray Conlogue , entitled The Impossible Nation .
he would learn a lot from that book on the reality of Canada , a reality symbolized by the Calgary declaration .
in 1980 , there was a referendum , the first referendum ever held in Quebec , and on that occasion , Quebec told Canada how much its situation in Canada was frustrating .
that referendum led to the Meech Lake agreement , the Meech Lake formula proposed by a federalist Quebec government , Robert Bourassa ' s government .
that agreement represented the minimum Quebec could ask from Canada at the time .
naturally , Canada refused that minimum and there was a second referendum in which Quebec voted even more strongly to express its discomfort at being part of Canada .
that process led to the Calgary declaration .
but there is absolutely nothing in this declaration .
it is a formula offering even less than the Meech Lake formula , where the uniqueness of Quebec within Canada is mixed in with so many other elements that we no longer recognize Quebec .
i wonder if the member could tell me how the Calgary declaration can solve the problem of unity and equality in Canada .
Mr. Lynn Myers :
Mr. Speaker , I am heartened by the Calgary declaration and what it stands for and especially by the consultation process that is part and parcel of that very important statement not only by the premiers but also by the territorial leaders .
it is important that we know that Canada is now able to proceed along these lines and take a look , and a hard look , by all Canadians in a consultation process to ensure that all Canadians are heard and that we try to unify the country in a manner consistent with our history and consistent with our aims and objectives as we move into the 21 st century .
the Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) :
hon. members , as we stated earlier , in questions and comments if there is more than one person wanting to respond , if I see some activity on the benches , please keep your questions and comments down to about a minute .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank our colleague from the Liberal Party for his very non - partisan speech .
it was very welcome .
i would however like to ask him a question .
we have seen over the last 15 years successive provincial separatist governments in the province of Quebec wanting to carve the province out of Canada .
given what he has seen over the last 10 to 15 years in this country , does he himself believe that the current Bloc Quebecois , Mr. Bouchard and the Parti Quebecois have any interest whatsoever in keeping Quebec within Canada ?
Mr. Lynn Myers :
Mr. Speaker , I would never presume to speak for the Parti Quebecois or the Bloc Quebecois but I would say on my own behalf that I would hope Canadians , men and women of goodwill across this great nation , would work very hard to ensure the viability and the unity of this great country of ours .
i would expect that would be the position taken by people who genuinely want to unify Canada and maintain the strength of this great nation .
i am heartened more and more by the fact that we are moving in this direction and I am confident that that is the direction that precisely we will take .
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) :
we are , in effect , as part of the Reform Party trying to articulate , trying to break the glass ceiling on the national unity issue .
this issue has been with us for over 200 years but in particular over the last 15 years we have seen our nation fractured into two solitudes or into a number of solitudes .
the ties that should bind us as the greatest nation of the earth are not being encouraged .
we have seen rumblings in the maritimes .
what a shame for a nation , for all the wealth that we have as a country , to have this happen .
if we are to continue on this course , we will indeed fracture .
would it not be a profound tragedy for that to happen ?
would it not be a profound tragedy for us to fracture into little solitudes in our own little worlds when indeed we could be far greater as a group than what we could be as individuals ?
at no point in time was this more evident than in 1995 during the referendum .
this did not merely appear on our television sets overnight or in a few months .
rather , it was the culmination of at least 15 years of profound dissatisfaction from the people of Quebec and people across this country .
the dissatisfaction of the people in Quebec is expressed perhaps in different ways but equally passionately by Canadians across this country .
we do not feel that the current constitutional envelope in which our country currently exists is working .
indeed , the proof is in the pudding .
the people of Quebec , people in British Columbia , people across our nation have been clamouring for a new vision for Canada , a new Canada where the provinces can have the powers to do what they do best and the feds have the powers to do what they do best , where Canadians have a direct input into the policy making that happens in this House .
what happens in this House is not a democracy , as we all know .
the people out there are disarticulated from the policy that is made in the House of Commons .
if , for argument ' s sake , we continue going the way we are going and separation starts to fall by the wayside as it has been , if in the next referendum the people vote 60 % no against separation , would that be success ?
i would argue that it is not success .
